Subs by Traff and Raceman Wow, this is an honor. 
I am friends with number four on Maxim's list comedy. 
Thanks. 
At first I was mad that Jessica Simpson was ahead of me. 
But then I saw the Dukes of Hazzard. 
Funny! 
What is that, baby oil? 
Actually, they use salad dressing, 'cause it gets a better sheen. 
This is ridiculous. 
What does any of this have to do with comedy? 
Ya burnt! 
Listen, I just... 
I wanna make sure you're not gonna regret this, you know? 
Because it's not just cute guys that buy these magazines, it's teenage boys with weird rashes and old guys that live at the Y. 
Liz, posing in Maxim is a great career move. 
There's no shame in it. 
I'm laughin', I'm horny, let's do this! 
Put the chicken near your mouth. 
Awesome. 
Oh! 
Well, you look happy. 
Somebody just have a root beer float? 
No, Josh's contract is up, which means it's time for my favorite thing in the world, negotiation. 
The essence of capitalism. 
There's nothing like it. 
God, I wish there was something I could negotiate with right now. 
Hey, Jack? 
Just a reminder, I need a couple minutes to go over breakage today-- how's noon? 
Can't do that. 
Make it 4:00 AM. 
That's no good. 
What about after rehearsal? 
10:00. 
Stop insulting me. 
3:00 AM. 
Midnight. 
You bring the coffee. 
2:30, you bring the coffee. 
That's my final. 
Done. 
Wow, you do have a talent. 
I can't wait to go mano a mano with Josh. 
Right, I think you mean mano a toddler. 
Josh is a very sweet, very dumb kid. 
Please go easy on him. 
I'll try to remember that when you and I meet with him later. 
What, me? No. 
Don't make me be part of this. 
Lemon, I would like to teach you something. 
I would like to be Michelle Pfeiffer to your angry black kid who learns that poetry is just another way to rap. 
No, Jack, I don't wanna learn about negotiation. 
I just want Josh to stay. 
The show needs him. 
Lesson number one, you don't need anyone. 
Sure, Josh tests well with female viewers 12 to 24, which is important to advertisers, because young women will buy just about anything. 
These sunglasses have a chip in them that makes the lenses change color as my iPod loses power. 
But whatever Josh brings to the show, he's still replaceable. 
He's not replaceable as my friend. 
He's not your friend now, he's your opponent. 
He's going to try to grab all the marbles, and it's our job to hide them. 
That's not how you play marbles, Jack. 
But that's how you keep them. 
Yo, remember that email we got from those Nigerians that needed our help gettin' all that money out of Africa? 
We did it! 
I got the check today. 
Say word? 
Word is bond. 
I would have been happy if our only reward was just helping that dethroned prince of Nigeria, but this is great! 
We should treat ourselves. 
Want to go to Vegas and buy a bunch of sarcophagi? 
Nah. 
I don't even use the ones I have. 
We could add someone else to the entourage. 
That's a good idea. 
Yo, what's young Larry doing these days? 
He's in Jay-Z's entourage. 
What about Cheese? 
He's rolling with Ghostface Killer now. 
Fatballz? 
Studying hotel administration at Cornell. 
Well, go ahead, Fatballz! 
That's a good program. 
Hello there, Mr. Jordan. 
Mr. Slattery, Mr. Griswold. 
I picked up your lunch from Sylvia's. 
Extra cornbread because I know you like it. 
Like it? 
I love it! 
I love this cornbread so much I wanna take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant. 
Pregnant cornbread. 
K, you like doing stuff for me, right? 
How would you like to be in my entourage? 
Well, that sounds like fun! 
What would I do? 
Well, let's see. 
Dotcom does the driving and the cooking. 
Grizz is in charge of sitting on me when I get over stimulated. 
But I have been looking for someone to harmonize with me. 
The sun'll come out Tomorrow Tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow Fa la la la There'll be sun This is a really special day. 
Just thinking about to Nice. 
Yowza. 
Isn't it great? 
These are the sexiest women in comedy? 
Where's Jack�e? 
Jenna, have you read your interview yet? 
Oh, no. 
Did I come across as interesting? 
'Cause I tried to mention Bono as much as possible. 
No, you come across as crazy. 
Why did you tell the reporter that you hate the troops? 
What? 
I didn't say I hate the troops. 
but it's just a bunch of gay guys that like to get in silly costumes and prance around. 
No, Liz, he heard me wrong. 
You know that I love the troops. 
Do you remember that fleet week after I broke up with David? 
Oh, God, this is bad. 
Nobody reads the articles in these things, right? 
Maybe no one'll pick it up? 
These Hollyweirdos from La La Land like Jenna Moron-ey are just un-American! 
So we are calling for a boycott of NBC, General Electric, and their parent company the Sheinhardt Wig Corporation. 
Jack, I was misquoted. 
This is my fault. 
I never should have let her do this Maxim thing in the first place. 
We're going to nip this thing in the bud. 
Jenna is going to make a public apology tomorrow on Hardball. 
You know what that is, don't you? 
Yes. 
Should I prepare a song? 
I really can't wait to renegotiate your contract. 
Thank you, sir. 
What? 
Hey. 
Does my vulva look swollen? 
Come here. 
I just wanna warn you as a friend about this contract thing. 
Jack is gunning for you. 
Really? 
Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. 
Jack said advertisers love you, because you test great with women 12 to 24. 
Which advertisers? 
Could I get free Choco Sticks? 
Just don't be pushy about your contract, and I promise we will get through this. 
Yeah, um... 
Alan actually told me not to talk to anybody about this. 
Alan? 
Who's Alan? 
Jacuzzi, the whole nine yards. 
Jack. 
Jack Donaghy. 
Alan Steiner. 
Good to see ya. 
I'm Josh Gerard's agent. 
Oh, really? 
Listen, I'd love to grab a little face time with you re: Josh's contract offer. 
We've got some serious troubs, my friend. 
We are not smiles-times. 
I'm sorry to hear that, Alan. 
What your skedge ma�ana? 
'Cause this is gonna be one serious negosh. 
My skedge is wide open, Alan. 
Hasta ma�ana. 
What a man, what a man what a mighty good man Mighty mighty good man Yeah! 
So, entourage, what's on the schedule for today? 
I have us penciled in for Halo. 
I love Halo! 
I love Halo so much, I wanna take it out behind a middle school and get it pregnant! 
Why are you guys laughing so hard? 
That's the same joke Mr. Jordan said earlier. 
I don't think so, K. 
 'Cause I like to keep my material fresh. 
I like to keep things fresh so much, that I wanna take it out behind the middle school and get it pregnant. 
Whoa, who just killed me? 
That's never happened before. 
I did, Mr. Jordan! 
That's impossible! 
I've beat all the world's best players. 
Grizz, Dotcom, my publicist, my stylist... 
Oh, well... 
I just killed you again! 
You're cheating! 
And I don't wanna play no more! 
I hate this! 
Grizz! 
I think it's best you come sit on me. 
And I just want the troops to kill everyone and come on home. 
Pretty good. 
But this is Hardball, Jenna, so you might wanna be more specific. 
You could say that you support the troops, but you feel that the war was poorly planned and started under false pretenses. 
And that we should have used those resources to hunt down Osama Bin Laden. 
Liz, I'm just worried that I'm gonna sound like I don't know what I'm talking about. 
Hey, would Sharon Stone worry about that? 
Mm-mm. 
Would Richard Gere? 
No. 
Then you go out there and you voice your opinions like a star. 
Okay, what are you gonna do if they ask about '08? 
Well, of course I want Hillary to be the first woman president. 
Ugh. 
No, Obama. 
You support Barrack Obama. 
Remember, you liked those pictures of him at the beach? 
Oh, right. 
Obama, what is he, Hispanic? 
No, he's black. 
And he's running for President? 
Good luck. 
Is this new furniture? 
This is my negotiation set. 
What? 
Gentlemen, please sit down. 
All right, let's skip the foreplay and get right to the penetraish. 
Josh is looking for a 15% raise, a two-pic guarantee from Universal, and time off for every Jewish holiday no matter how ridiculous. 
I mean, Yaznach is coming up. 
That seems pretty reasonable, right, Jack? 
Here's my counteroffer. 
One dollar. 
What? 
Oh, boy. 
 That's absurd. 
You know what's absurd? 
These photos I found of Josh roughhousing with Lance Bass at SeaWorld. 
What, we were just being silly. 
My offer is now 75 cents. 
Tic toc tic toc tic toc. 
It keeps getting lower. 
I think we should take it. 
Relax. 
Look, Jack... 
we know about the testing. 
Women from 12 to 24... 
love my guy. 
Who told you that? 
Oh, Liz did. 
Shut up. 
What? 
That was privileged information. 
That's what I thought. 
Awse. 
We are back in the game. 
I knew you weren't ready for a big chair. 
Yo, Kenneth, we need to talk, man. 
Oh, I've had this conversation before. 
You're marrying my mom, aren't you? 
No. 
It's about how you're treating Tracy. 
You're beating him at Halo, you're not laughing at his jokes. 
He's the king around here. 
You gotta respect that. 
Oh, my gosh. 
I had no idea I was causing a problem. 
Hey, I got next game. 
Hold up. 
How are you beating Kenneth, Grizz? 
I don't know. 
If Kenneth can beat me, and you can beat Kenneth, then by the transitive property, you should beat me too! 
Have you been letting me win? 
Just at some things. 
Things? 
Plural? 
What is the world's only egg-laying mammal? 
The Easter bunny! 
Right again! 
That's a green pie piece. 
Amazed. 
Raaah! 
Yeah, what, cat? 
Yeah, Dotcom! 
Yeah, Grizz! 
Have you two been treating me like this all this time? 
Like a child? 
No no no, I won't stand for this. 
Entourage disbanded! 
Oh, my. 
Tucker Carlson, you heard what Jenna Maroney had to say. 
She supports the troops. 
Well, here's a question, Chris. 
Why do we care what she thinks about anything? 
This woman strikes me as another empty-headed self-involved member of the Hollywood ignorati. 
You know, for someone who's super super hot, you're really cranky. 
I have just as much right to my opinion as you or Chris. 
I'm not sure you do. 
You've been on the show for 20 minutes now. 
You sang six bars of something called Muffin Top. 
Thank you. 
And then told a disgusting story about Fleet Week. 
I guess this is the state of political discourse in this country nowadays. 
And that's fine, let's just embrace it. 
Let's have our policies determined by former Cable Ace Award nominees. 
First, I was great in that Arliss. 
Second of all, if they president is so serious about the war of terror, why doesn't he hunt down and capture Barrack Obama before he strikes again? 
It's time for a change, America. 
That's why I'm voting for Osama in 2008. 
Oh, no comeback? 
Ya burnt! 
Hey, Jack, I was totally gonna call you. 
Which of your massive screw-ups should we discuss first? 
How about the Jenna situation? 
That is taken care of. 
I have written an op ed piece for the New York Times under Jenna's name in which I put the media on trial. 
Boo! 
Here's the plan. 
We're gonna take Jenna, put some flags behind her, have her sing a song that rhymes USA with "Make them pay," dress her in an eagle costume, and we're gonna call it a salute to the troops episode. 
Okay. 
Moving on, Josh Gerard. 
I had him right where I wanted him. 
Until my partner stabbed me in the back. 
I didn't mean to do that. 
I'm sorry. 
I was just trying to give my friend a head's up. 
Why can't we all just sit down in normal chairs and figure this out? 
Suri, is Josh in yet? 
Josh isn't coming in today. 
He's sick. 
He said he was throwing up all night. 
A sick out? 
I didn't think he had it in him. 
What are you talking about? 
He's faking. 
He's gonna stay home until we give in to his demands. 
No, Josh could not come up with a sneaky plan like that. 
He told me he was a pallbearer at his brother's wedding. 
He's probably just sick because he's stressed out about his job. 
Lemon, what happened in your childhood to make you believe that people are good? 
You know what? 
If my friendships and my job are in compatible, I choose my friends. 
And right now, I am going to get some chicken soup from Josh's favorite place and take it to him and say that I hope he feels better. 
Do you ever get any emails other than from match.com? 
No no, don't look at that. 
Aaah! 
Damn it! 
Close, right? 
Feel like I'm above the rim. 
Can't palm the ball. 
Sir, I think you made a mistake firing Grizz and Dotcom. 
They just wanna make you feel better about yourself. 
They disrespected me. 
But don't you miss them? 
You're the only one I can trust, K. 
You're my whole entourage now. 
Oh, I'm not so sure I can handle that. 
Yes, you can. 
Because you were honest with me. 
I don't need a couple of yes-men. 
I need the truth. 
Well, if that's the case... 
then you should know that you're never gonna dunk this basketball. 
Also, that Oscar you have is made of chocolate. 
And that lady you European kissed last night was actually a gentleman... 
Okay, that's enough. 
Oh, here comes one right now. 
Excuse me, do you work for NBC? 
Oh, no, I was just passing through there on my way to church. 
Well, are you interested in taking back your country? 
Am I! 
Then join here tomorrow night for a protest against the freedom-hating Jenna Maroney and TGS! 
There will be snacks! 
I will definitely be there. 
Large chicken soup to go, please. 
John and I saw your tape. 
Very very impressed. 
You seem like a perfect match for The Daily Show. 
We are always looking for new correspondents. 
Josh? You stupid turd. 
Hey! 
Liz. 
This is... 
Yeah, I can guess who this is. 
Are you trying to get on another show? 
Behind my back? 
Look, Liz, I'm sorry. 
It's just business. 
No, it's not business. 
I stood up for you. 
You were opening for a puppet when I found you. 
How could you betray me like this? 
You know, that's not even the worst part. 
You know what the worst part is? 
You proved Jack Donaghy right! 
Again! 
And by the way, what kind of moron calls out sick and then comes to work to have a meeting? 
I get an NBC discount here. 
Idiot! 
I'm a big fan of your show. 
I want you to crush Josh. 
I want you to crush him. 
Mr. Jordan, Keith called on your cell. 
He said they were "at the thing, and Lil' Zay just end up running." 
What did you tell him? 
Well, he wanted Dwayne Jr.'s number, 
so I gave it to him. 
You did what? 
Damn it, K, now I have to hear from Tanisha's mom on how they both mad at the twins. 
You have to handle this stuff better. 
Mr. Jordan, I don't know 
any of these people. 
But Grizz would have... 
Damn it, turn on the TV for me. 
Dotcom set this up. 
I don't know how it works. 
Television on! 
Pornography! 
Good, you're here. 
Josh and his agent are on their way up. 
Ha ha, yeah. 
Then they're gonna be on their way down. 
Um, you know, that was weak. 
But you're in the mix, you're having fun. 
I like that. 
Gentlemen! 
Make yourselves comfortable. 
What are all these headshots for? 
Nothing. 
Just some meetings we're taking. 
Meetings? 
And if... 
Look, Jack, I think I should tell you, Josh has an offer from The Daily Show. 
Yes, Liz mentioned that. 
I don't think that's gonna pan out. 
What, are you kidding? 
What happened? 
What'd you do to our offer? 
I called my friend Saul Sheinhardt at our parent company Sheinhardt Wigs who called his nephew Morty Sheinhardt who called his son, John Stewart. 
 Ah ha Ya burnt! 
Let's get down to brass tacks. 
Josh can stay. 
Thank God! 
But no raise, no movies. 
And only one Jewish holiday. 
What's the one where they go into the tent? 
Sukkot. 
That's the one. 
We have a deal? 
Deal, thank you. 
I need this money. 
I have a really bad sex addiction. 
Sorry. 
That's it? 
I thought you said we could crush him. 
What are you talking about? 
I took away everything. 
That's crushing. 
No, do more stuff! 
You made me look like an idiot. 
You have to pay. 
Liz, he's not getting a raise. 
Do the worm! 
Do the worm! 
Good Lord, the worm! 
That's so degrading. 
Are its origins German? 
Now say five reasons I'm better than you! 
Smarter than me. 
One! 
You can beat me in arm wrestling. 
Two! 
You read the paper. 
Yeah, suck it, I do read the paper. 
You want me to do anything? 
Be a crab! 
Crab. 
Fight the worm! 
Wow! 
Liz, you took to this like a natural. 
More than I ever... 
Okay, now, the crab is getting aroused. 
Shut it down. 
Shut it down. 
Small town worn fatigues Big dreams and little leagues Gigantic star-spangled fireworks Light up the night You know, you actually did a good job on this. 
Why do you sound so surprised? 
I love America. 
Just because I think gay dudes should be allowed to adopt kids and we should all have hybrid cars, doesn't mean I don't love America. 
I said America She said America. 
And cue the pinwheels. 
Okay, the pinwheels are lit, but they're not spinning. 
When they're not spinning, they look exactly like... 
Swastikas. 
TGS, Totally Godless Suckers. 
Or Satanists. 
Ooh, that's even better. 
Hi! 
Entourage... 
Oh! 
You gotta get me out of here! 
Make a path, please! 
Help! 
Wow, Tray, you really saved us from that crowd, yo. 
You sure did, man. 
You sure did. 
Yeah. 
Of course I did! 
I love you guys. 
I love you so much, I'm gonna take you behind the middle school and get you pregnant. 
I love you, Dotcom. 
I love you, Grizz. 
And this is the two-bedroom. 
Wow. 
By the hammer of Thor! 
Can you afford this place? 
Yeah. 
I can with this new promotion. 
It's...a lot more money. 
Like "get away with murdering my first wife" kind of dough. 
Mm-hmm. 
See, now, I could hang a huge TV right there. 
You could get that third humidifier you always dreamed about. 
Slow down. 
I'm not ready to move my humidifiers yet. 
Oh, I know. 
I don't mean right away. 
I just meant...someday. 
Hopefully. 
Yeah, good. 
Someday. 
But for now, I got a great job. 
A kick-ass girlfriend. 
I deserve an apartment to match. 
And I think this is definitely it. 
I'll take this one too. 
My son Ahmed will keep his motorcycles here. 
Oh! Thanks for coming. 
Oh...ooh. 
Lemon! 
Oh, welcome back. 
How was Paris? 
Paris was fantastic. 
We stayed in this little place in the Seventh that Phoebe knew about. 
I'm Phoebe. 
We've met before. 
Jack proposed to me outside your office. 
I have hollow bones. 
Like a bird. 
Yes, no. 
I remember you, hi. 
Hi. 
Well, I should go. 
We've just won the auction rights to a fantastic collection of Chinese erotica. 
Pick out a good one for me. 
Careful. 
Bye. 
So...have you guys 
set a date? 
Yes, we have. 
May 18th. 
That's Bianca's wedding date. 
It was my idea. 
That's fast. 
Well, there are no rules in love, Lemon. 
My...Princeton roommate 
did it the right way. 
Dated his college girlfriend for 13 years, and the marriage didn't last eight months. 
And now he's a post-op transgender. 
Will you look at that? 
Phoebe reset my watch to New York time while I was sleeping on the plane. 
She really is a wonderful girl. 
And I do hope the two of you get to know each other better. 
Okay, sure. 
Why don't you have a girls' day out? 
Take Jenna with you. 
You could have lunch, go shopping. 
Here...take my gold card. 
Ooh, it's heavy. 
It's...made of gold. 
Ah. Wow. 
Turned me down, Liz Lemon. 
Who? 
The damn bank. 
I need a loan to finance my Thomas Jefferson movie. 
It's gonna be at least $30 million with all the Claymation sex scenes in it. 
And they didn't want to pay for that? 
It's all right. 
The movie's just a small part of my plan. 
What plan? 
The Tracy Jordan comeback. 
I'm doing a comedy tour, a Michael McDonald cover album. 
Ah, boy, I don't know, Tray. 
I don't think of you as a great multitasker. 
What can I do? 
I'm on my grind. 
I'm gonna have so much money, my grandkids are gonna play lacrosse. 
Lacrosse, Liz Lemon. 
"I'm on my krind." 
Is that a... 
There he is. 
The Floydster! 
I heard you were going in for your final interview. 
I wanted to put in a good word. 
All right, well, that should put me over the top. 
Oh, you're already there. 
The other candidate is an outsider. 
And we like to promote from within. 
Plus, his name is Alan Garkel. 
You're never gonna lose a job to a guy named Garkel. 
Did someone say my name? 
Nah, you're not gonna beat that. 
Well-played, Garkel. 
Because Carl's trying to kill the gophers, but then the explosion knocks Danny's ball into the hole, and he wins the tournament. 
And that is the plot ofCaddyshack. 
I can't believe you've never seen it. 
Classic. 
Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry. 
Oh, you like Wagner? 
No, I like Elmer Fudd. 
? Kill da wabbit ? 
? Kill da wabbit ? ? 
My parents were both poets, so I... 
don't really get it. 
So this has just been a whirlwind romance for you. 
Just a...whirl of wind. 
Look, I know what you must be thinking. 
What kind of a woman marries a man she hardly knows? 
Whatisshe after? 
No, no, no. 
I don't think that. 
I completely get it, why you would wanna marry Jack. 
I'd marry Jack in a heartbeat. 
I would have a three-way with two Jacks. 
You need to cool it. 
Let's face it at our age, we can't afford to waste any time. 
Mm-hmm. 
Floyd and I have been dating for a month. 
Do you think I should be mad that I don't have a ring? 
Wow, howSex in the City are we right now? 
I'm Samantha, you're Charlotte, and you're the lady at home who watches it. 
Dude, check it out. 
Bill Cosby hates you. 
What? 
Look here. 
"Tracy Jordan has made a career "out of exploiting black stereotypes. 
He is an embarrassment to African-Americans." 
Why would he say that? 
What have I ever done to embarrass black people? 
Uh... 
Why are we doing this? 
Because the Jets lost! 
Mr. Jordan, 
your manager called. 
Temple University has canceled your stand-up appearance. 
And Michael McDonald is denying permission to record any of his songs. 
In other words: ? Oh, Tracy, you can't ? 
? Use any of my songs ? ? 
This is no coincidence. 
What are you talking about? 
The bank loan. 
The Michael McDonald situation. 
Temple University. 
Dr. Cosby 
is sending a message! 
They're out to destroy me! 
Who is? 
The Black Crusaders. 
Oh, Floyd would love this one. 
Yikes! 
If I was gonna spend $600 to have my boobs pinched, I would have gone to that fundraiser at the Clintons' house. 
Come on, that was solid! 
Liz, I'm concerned I'm boring Jack sexually. 
No, no. 
No...ugh. 
We've only just got engaged, and already our intercourse is infrequent and unimaginative. 
Phoebe, I'm really not that kind of girlfriend. 
I would gladly pick you up at the airport. 
In Paris, he fell asleep on top of me. 
I mean, I just want to make him happy. 
If he's happy, I'm happy, you know? 
Mm. 
Do you have that credit card? 
Thanks. 
Hi, I'll take everything. 
Liz, can you help me? 
Yes, ma'am. 
I don't know you, but I will help you. 
Damn it. 
I can't believe it. 
Garkel? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm just sick of it. 
I'm so tired of this city. 
I am so tired of the rat race. 
Fellas! 
You gotta keep it down, okay? 
I got work in the morning. 
Molnya is looking very strong tonight. 
Mr. Debarber, come on. 
Fine. 
20 across the board. 
Yeah, you gotta talk to your landlord about that rat race. 
That is my landlord. 
Oh. 
Yeah. 
Maybe I just need to go out of town for a little while. 
That's a good idea. 
Vermont is always nice. 
Or the Bahamas. 
I was thinking of Cleveland. 
That is also a place. 
I just haven't been home in a long time. 
We need to search your bag. 
Ugh. 
Of course they do. 
You know, I dream about moving back to Lakewood. 
Or maybe even Shaker Heights. 
Big Creek Parkway. 
Sending the kids to St. John Bosco's, you know. 
Maybe even cheering on the tribe at the Jake. 
This dream, this is way down the road, right? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Three, maybe four years. 
What's this fungus cream for? 
All right, that's it. 
Show's over. 
Gimme that. 
Let's just walk. 
So how long do you see yourself living in New York? 
Well, like, forever. 
At least, I did. 
Really? 
You wanna end up like that? 
No. 
I'm gonna be like her. 
Oh, there is nothing like New York in the spring! 
It's--oh! 
Ooh. 
Ooh. 
All right, come on. 
This is the capital of the world. 
The culture, the div Ugh! 
Uck! 
You all right? 
He spit in my mouth! 
Ugh! 
Let's go to Cleveland. 
Oh, blurgh! 
Hey, Frank told me about that Cosby thing. 
That is harsh. 
Harsh? 
I'm done. 
The Black Crusaders want to make an example out of me. 
I'm not gonna ask you who that is. 
The Black Crusaders are a secret group of powerful black Americans. 
Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are the chief majors. 
But Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, and Gordon fromSesame Street, they're members too. 
And they meet four times a year in the skull of the Statue of Liberty. 
You can read about that on the interweb. 
Ah, well, it must be true if it's on the "interweb." 
Right, uh-huh. 
Make fun of me all you want, Liz Lemon. 
Do you know they'll ruin anybody who they think are making black people look bad? 
They tanked 50 Cent's movie. 
The blew out Terrell Owens' ankle. 
And they canceled Eddie Murphy's Oscar, 'cause he, uh, ran out on Scary Spice. 
And now they after Tracy Jordan! 
Tracy, I know the movie is important to you, and you're stressed out and everything, but keep it together, okay? 
The cleanup continues. 
Fortunately, there were no injuries. 
Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders are coming for you. 
We'll have more on the weather coming up... 
Man, I wish somebody else had seen that. 
Hi. 
Look what Phoebe got me. 
Golf clubs? 
Not just golf clubs. 
These clubs once belonged to President Gerald Ford. 
Oh, wow. 
So what do you think of Phoebe? 
Oh, well... 
we had fun. 
And, uh, Phoebe bought some bonkers underwear. 
So have fun with that tonight. 
Well, not tonight. 
Uh, may I? 
Oh. 
Thank you. 
Not tonight unfortunately. 
She's, uh, speaking in a seminar up at Columbia. 
And as much as I would like to attend, I haven't been above 72nd Street in over a decade. 
Well, I'm glad you're happy. 
Ha! 
It's all Phoebe. 
We have an attraction that can only be described as... 
wolf-like. 
Lupine. 
Okay. 
I am so exhausted. 
Paris was, to borrow a phrase, just...bonkers. 
Yes, Phoebe said. 
Do you cover him? 
Psst! Psst! 
Phoebe isn't going to Columbia tonight. 
She had me call a car to take her to this address downtown. 
So what do you want me to do, go spy on her? 
For Mr. Donaghy's sake. 
I know you have your doubts about this. 
I can see it in your eyes. 
It's weird, right? 
Then again, all relationships are weird. 
I mean, my boyfriend Floyd wants to go to Cleveland. 
Ah, thank God. 
Mr. Donaghy's office. 
Just a quick look. 
By the hammer of Thor! 
Ew. 
Jack, I have to talk to you. 
Is this about the Tracy situation? No. 
Then it'll have to wait. 
What Tracy situation? 
I tried to call you. 
He set fire to a cardboard cutout of Al Roker, and now he's locked himself in his dressing room. 
Oh, brother. 
Tracy! 
Come out. 
Nobody is trying to get you. 
Have you seen the cover of this month'sOprahmagazine? 
It's an anagram for "Outlaw Sour Tray." 
Who taught Tracy about anagrams? 
I'm gonna call Dr. Spaceman. 
Hey, car's downstairs. 
You ready to go? 
Um... 
The Black Crusaders are trying to get rid of me. 
They want me to disappear like Coolio. 
Coolio is around! 
What Would you also prescribe something for Tracy which would keep him awake during sex? 
Oh, great. 
Okay, I'll talk to you later. 
Thanks. 
Let's get outta here. 
? What hot spot's got 
the hippest groove? ? 
Welcome to Cleveland. 
Good morning. 
? Where all the real 
gone daddies move ? 
Good morning. 
Hi. 
Hello. 
What smells so good? 
Cleveland. 
? Where the jet set swing 
with hepcats ? 
? Shop at Higby's, 
then we'll hit the Flats ? 
Excuse me. 
Are you a model? 
No. 
Oh, you are so skinny. 
You really should eat something. 
? I say, Cleveland, hello ? 
? Yeah ? 
? New York and Paris 
just don't have ? 
? The sights you see 
and you can have ? 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
Ugh. 
Would you like to pet a real police horse? 
? Chef Boyardee 
was born here ? 
Yes! 
? Come on, cool cats, 
and play your skins ? 
? In Lyndhurst 
and the Burg of Twins ? 
Oh, ladies first. 
? I say Cleveland, hello ? 
Hi, I'll have two hotdogs, a pretzel with extra melted cheese... 
Hiya. 
Ms. Lemon, 
this is Kenneth, the NBC page in New York City. 
I hate to bother you out west, but Tracy Jordan hasn't come to work. 
Kenneth, don't be so New York uptight. 
I'm sure he'll show up. 
? Look over there, 
I think I see a movie star ? 
? Even movie stars, 
they come to Cleveland ? 
? To get away ? 
? Tracy Jordan, 
you've gotta get away ? 
? Gotta get away, 
gotta get away ? 
? To Cleveland ? ? 
Liz... 
I have something important I wanna talk to you about. 
The top law firm in Cleveland wants me. 
And...I think 
I should accept. 
What? Really? 
What's this? 
It's a house in the Heights that I can afford. 
When did you have time to look for jobs and houses? 
When you were at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
Did I tell you I sat in ZZ Top's car? 
And then I had lunch with Little Richard. 
And, I know it's not TGS, but... 
I'm sure you can find a job at one of the local TV stations. 
You sureould. 
We need a host for a new cooking show on WKYC. 
Uh... 
Where have you been? 
Cleveland. 
For God sakes, Lemon, we'd all like to flee to the Cleve. 
And club up down at the Flats and have lunch with Little Richard. 
But we fight those urges because we have responsibilities. 
What's going on? 
Tracy. 
He's missing. 
What? 
No. Kenneth, have you 
tried to call Tracy? 
Yes, ma'am, I tried all six of his cell phones. 
It's almost as if he never existed. 
Or maybe he's not answering. 
Lemon, TGS without Tracy Jordan is basically a puppet show. 
You know, I'm right here. 
Oh, why am I doing this when I could be happy living in Cleveland? 
What? 
Floyd and I are thinking of moving. 
No, you're not. 
No, you're not. 
Look, every great getaway has that moment when you want to pack it all in and stay. 
That's how I ended up with a timeshare... 
in Port Arthur, Texas. 
I don't think that's what this is. 
I mean, Floyd is pretty great. 
And, look, in Cleveland, I'm a model. 
Yeah, we're all models west of the Allegheny. 
I'm serious about this. 
Maybe you should go. 
I mean, your head is obviously not in the game lately. 
And now you've lost Tracy. 
Maybe you're burned out. 
What is this? 
This is Frank's "Hot Baby" sketch, which is regrettable, but we have no Tracy Jordan and a show in two days. 
But, hey, that's not gonna be your problem once you move to Ohio. 
No, you're not. 
Frank, that's gonna get cut. 
Blurgh! 
Did you say anything to Jack? 
No, but I'm going to if you don't. 
Oh, grow up, Liz. 
I didn't tell Jack where I was going 'cause I didn't want him to get upset about nothing. 
That man was a former lover of mine. 
I was ending it with him, forever. 
Uh-huh, and are all your ex-boyfriends rich, older gentlemen? 
I care about Jack. 
I make him a better man. 
You know how John Lennon was better than the rest of the Beatles, but didn't realize it until he met Yoko Ono? 
Well, I'm Jack's Yoko. 
Youwantto be Yoko? 
This is none of your business, anyway. 
I'm marrying Jack. 
He's everything I ever wanted. Oh, I bet he is. 
You don't know anything about me, so back off! 
What happened to your accent? 
Um... 
I don't know what you're on about. 
You...daft wanker. 
Hello? 
Hello, Liz Lemon. 
It's me. 
Stacy Gordon. 
Tracy, where are you calling from? 
I can't tell you that. 
I'm sorry, Liz Lemon. 
I wanna thank you for everything you've done. 
But I quit. 
For God's sakes, Tracy, where are you? 
Starting a new life. 
Because of the Black Crusaders? 
That's crazy. 
Tray? 
Damn it, Lemon, why didn't you tell me the Black Crusaders were after Tracy? 
Surprisingly fast. 
Oh. 
I'm on it. 
I can't go to Cleveland. 
Hi. 
Hi. I'm sorry. 
I just, I've been thinking about this. 
And I think you're great. 
And obviously Cleveland is great. 
But I can't move. 
I know. 
My life is here. 
My friends are here. 
The sh is here. 
And I've known you a month. 
Oh, you hate me right now, don't you? No. 
No, it was a crazy idea to begin with. 
We were on a vacation high Exactly. 
It's like a drug. 
Right if the whole world moved to their favorite vacation spots, then the whole world would live in Hawaii and Italy and Cleveland. 
Totally, I mean... 
But just knowing that C-Town is out there as an option for the future Liz... 
it's gonna make it so much easier-- Liz... 
I took that job. 
Blurgh. 
Did you locate Tracy? 
Ugh, not yet. 
I'm working on it. 
You know, you never answered my question the other day. 
What do you think of Phoebe? 
Honestly, I wish I had the guts to do what you're doing. 
Just...going for it. 
God bless. 
You still haven't answered my question. 
I...think she 
likes you a lot. 
And I think she takes care of you. 
And she's smart and pretty. 
And completely wrong. 
And she doesn't deserve you. 
I think she's weird, and I don't like her, and her ex-boyfriend is old. 
And I don't even think she's British! 
And you shouldn't marry her, Jack. 
Please don't marry her! 
Oh, my God. 
Lemon, Phoebe was right. 
You are infatuated with me. 
What? 
No! No, no, no. 
Lemon, you are a wonderful woman. 
And you deserve to be as happy as I am. 
Maybe with Floyd, right? 
No, don't mention Floyd. 
Floyd is not happening. 
Floyd is moving. 
Floyd is moving? 
What did you do? 
What didIdo? 
I acted like a rational adult! 
I didn't get engaged to some gold digger, and then delude myself into thinking that I could keep up with her. 
Yeah, Jack, I know that you fell asleep on top of her in Paris. 
In Paris, France. 
I think you should go. 
Uh, Phoebe, darling, Lemon was just leaving. 
Blurgh. 
michael: my name is michael westen. 
i used to be a spy until... 
Man: we got a burn notice on you. you're blacklisted. 
when you're burned, you've got nothing  no cash, no credit, no job history. 
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. 
Where am i? 
miami. 
you do whatever work comes your way. 
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you. 
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... 
Should we shoot them? 
...an old friend who used 
to inform on you to the fbi... 
You know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls. 
...family, too... 
hey, is that your mom again? 
...if you're desperate. 
someone needs your help, michael. 
bottom line  as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere. 
whether you're hunting down extremists in the mountains of kashmir or tracking arms dealers through the streets of moscow, the life of a spy takes a toll. 
so during downtimes, you work out, eat right, and try to recharge your batteries, because you never know what's waiting for you around the next corner. 
Fiona: hello, michael. 
This is bud  bail jumper. 
We just got back from a lovely time in the everglades. 
You have a real chair in this dump? 
Poor bud's in a bad mood. he didn't like 
the music in my trunk. 
Why is he here? 
Oh, we're killing time, Waiting for the bail bondsman to open his office. 
You know, he's been throwing me more jobs Than i can manage lately, And i was thinking, as long as you're still burned... 
Trudging through swamps, looking for guys like bud? 
i'm not hurting for money that bad, fi. 
could have fooled me. 
Think about it, michael. 
Your strategic know-how... 
My expertise in the field. 
My brains, your brawn. 
Time for you to go, bud. 
Mr. westen, 
detective paxson, miami p.d. 
This is detective lopez. 
You mind if we ask you a couple questions? 
I'm in the middle of something, actually. 
Hmm. 
I understand you're a bounty hunter, miss glenanne. 
Do you have a bail-enforcer's license? 
Uh, actually, i'm freelancing. 
Actually, you're harboring a fugitive. 
Consider this a warning. 
Michael: uh, detective, I spoke with some officers at the station recently, And i think we cleared up all the questions they had. 
Well, i have different questions. 
They're about a traffic incident  Three cars blown up, three more totaled. 
Apparently, we have a one-man wrecking crew on our hands. 
Well, how can you be so sure it's a man? 
I'm as progressive as the next gal, miss glenanne, But someone matching mr. westen's description 
Was spotted driving away from the scene. 
White male, dark hair... 
...athletically built? 
I hope your department pays overtime, Because you're gonna be searching For a few hundred thousand suspects. 
I've got just one. 
Stuff's been blowing up pretty steadily Since you arrived in miami. 
So, are you gonna answer my questions, Or am i gonna pick my way through everything you own? 
That would be a workbench, six power tools, Four yogurts  three yogurts. 
I actually had one. 
blueberry. 
Well, you can tell me all about it at the station, mr. westen. 
Get in the car. 
I'm gonna enjoy this. 
Welcome to your worst nightmare, mr. westen. 
You look wretched, michael. 
Well, it's not a day spa in there, fi. 
Spent the last 24 hours in the drunk tank. 
So, detective paxson wasn't questioning you the whole time? 
Oh, no, there was plenty of that, too. 
 she's gonna be some real trouble. 
She already is. 
she cost me my bounty. 
I'll make it up to you sometime. 
Well, how does now sound? 
i lined up a new gig. 
I'll fill you in on all the details over lunch. 
Come on, fi. 
not another bail jumper. 
No, but one of my old bail jumpers got me the job. 
It's a referral. 
So, how's stevie? 
Doing time up at raiford medium-security. 
Says "hi," by the way. 
Her brother jumped bail on forgery charges. 
I chased him to boca. 
Had to hit him with a brick to get him in the car. 
Sweet guy. 
He your partner? 
Well, you'd have to ask him that. 
What can we help you with? 
this is my son, brandon. 
He's been staying with his dad, howard. 
We're separated. 
Howard hasn't let me see or talk to brandon for three days. 
Well, it sounds like you should be talking to a lawyer about this. 
I have -- three of them. 
They all say it'll take months to get him into court. 
Howard just needs someone to knock some sense into him. 
it's not a problem. 
Anything else you need? 
I just want to see my son. 
Everything will be fine. 
Right, michael? 
Excuse me. 
Do you know my new girl? 
She rebuilt this engine by herself. 
I'm telling you, Just put a nice, sturdy tool in that woman's hand  I got it, sam. 
find out anything? 
Yeah, i asked around about your lady detective. 
Turns out you got a stalker with a badge. 
I mean, she checked every self-storage place From here up to fort lauderdale. 
She found some surveillance video Of you ducking into a place down by homestead. 
Not good. 
what you got there? 
Some c-4 and detonators. 
Well, she's gonna own them soon, 'cause she's working on a warrant. 
There's a hearing in a couple of days, But you got to get your stash out of there before then. 
Fiona: are you coming, michael? 
Oh, mike, uh, you know, Since i'm helping you avoid felony charges, I thought maybe there'd be a lunch in it for me. 
Michael? 
Next time. 
Geez. 
i got you, baby. 
Patricia: typical. 
Howard spends 80 hours a week at the office, And he can't find an hour to take care of his yard. 
Fiona: go ahead and take it. 
Just keep your eyes on the street. 
This should be pretty straightforward. 
Yeah, ma? 
It's somebody's birthday today. 
I thought you could come over for a nice dinner With sam and fiona. 
We're celebrating birthdays now? 
We always did. 
don't you remember sixth grade? 
Your friend billy kane was there. 
it was his party, mom. 
Well, it's never too late. 
All right, where are we getting takeout from? 
Who said anything about takeout? 
Howard! 
So, you coming or not? 
i'll try. 
Michael, i don't want to hear how you'll try. 
i want you to promise. 
fine. 
i promise i'll try. 
Howard! 
You can stop now. 
You can stop now! 
Ugh! oh! 
Howard... 
We just want to see your son. 
Oh, you don't understand. 
I'm sure whatever the issue is, you can work it out with your ex. 
No! that's not 
what i mean. 
He was kidnapped. 
Of course he was. 
Brandon didn't come home from school on thursday. 
I got a call. uh, i don't 
know the guy's name. 
Is he asking for money? 
No, i-i-i work at a diamond wholesaler. 
He wanted information about an upcoming shipment. 
Said not to contact the police, Or i'd never... 
See brandon again. 
He's calling today with instructions. 
How could you not tell me? 
I didn't want you calling the police, patricia. 
I was trying to protect brandon. 
That was not your decision to make! he's my son, too! 
Look, he just wants diamonds. 
i'm going to give them to him. 
Howard, it's not that simple. 
If this guy really wants to disappear, He has no incentive to return your son. 
Brandon's old enough to identify him. 
Whoa, whoa, wwhat  what are you saying? 
You know what he's saying, howard. 
They're not gonna bring us brandon back alive! 
We should call the police. 
no! 
No cops! 
he said he would kill him. 
Enough. 
Michael and i will take care of him... 
...without involving 
the cops. 
But you can't be at each other's throats, okay? 
When the kidnapper calls again, You're going to say you're not doing anything Until you get proof that your son is alive and unhurt, And then you're gonna ask for a face-to-face meeting. 
You think he'll come? 
If he wants his diamonds, he will. 
And if we're lucky, we'll follow him back to where brandon is. 
Well, won't that be dangerous? 
It doesn't matter. 
i'll do it. 
Whatever it takes to get brandon back. 
I told howard not to take that stupid job. 
Sales manager. 
We were doing just fine as reps. 
You work together? 
we did. 
It was great till he took that promotion. 
Long hours, travel, and now this. 
well, i'm sure this was not part of the plan When he took the job. 
Well, he should have known the risk. 
Patricia, i want you to try something. 
It's a relaxation exercise i do in situations like this. 
I want you to close your eyes... 
And breathe deep. 
Picture a peaceful mountain stream. 
Can you do that? 
Now picture yourself... 
Drowning the kidnapper in the stream. 
You're taking a rock from the stream And raising it above your head... 
michael: fi. 
...and with tremendous force, 
you're bringing  Fi! 
We got something. 
he's passed by twice. 
smart criminals have a variety of ways to find out if a meeting is under police surveillance. 
some are more subtle than others. 
Howard, right? 
yeah. 
I'm santora. 
Nice to meet you. 
Ugh! oh! oh! 
throw a few punches... 
and any cops in the area have to come running. 
God! do something! 
We can't. 
he's testing us. 
But he's gonna kill him! 
he's  Whoa. 
patricia. patricia! 
If you want your son back, you'll stay in the car. 
You got any friends around here i should know about? 
Ugh! 
You tell anyone about our little arrangement? 
look at me, howard. 
behavior in a combat situation is unpredictable. 
sometimes trained soldiers go screaming for the hills. 
sometimes guys who have never fired anything bigger than a cap gun turn out to have ice in their veins. 
Nobody knows. 
Let me see my son. 
Today's headline. 
the kid's fine. 
Now, let's be clear. 
You're not calling the shots here. 
You're not gonna make any more demands, And you're not gonna try anything cute. 
If anyone touches me, If i'm a minute late checking in with my guys, You never see the kid again. 
Got it? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
Ugh! 
That's just so you don't forget. 
Now... 
Let's talk about my diamonds. 
in the field, it's often your human instincts that jeopardize an operation. 
helping people is great, but there are times that impulse can get people killed. 
sometimes the right thing to do is let a guy bleed for a while. 
Stay here. 
He kept hitting me. 
i didn't know what to do. 
You did everything right, howard. 
He said he wants the stones in 24 hours... 
Or brandon dies. 
That's not gonna happen. 
How'd we do? 
Uh, not so great. 
Santora didn't go near the kid. 
He's hanging out at a bar, sipping mojitos. 
Mike, this guy's not afraid to be seen. 
But i thought you could follow him to where brandon is. 
I thought  he's smart. 
He's keeping the job compartmentalized. 
Howard's at the hospital getting stitches. 
That was all for nothing?! 
Not nothing. 
we'll know when he moves. 
I got a buddy keeping an eye on him. 
Why can't you just grab him and waterboard him or something, Make him tell us where brandon is? 
You torture somebody, They'll tell you anything to make it stop. 
No, there are better ways to get reliable information. 
Sam, how do you feel about a little... 
Reverse interrogation? 
Never been a big fan, mike. 
What's reverse interrogation? 
We used to do it during the cold war. 
You send one of your guys in there to be interrogated To learn what the bad guys are worried about. 
You play your cards right, Their questions will tell you all about them. 
You play your cards wrong  Have a little faith, sam. 
How long do you think it'll take to set up? 
Car, building... 
Some cop lights  a couple hours. 
All right, call me when it's done. 
We're gonna find your son. 
This is a valuable lesson for you. 
C-4 is meant to be used, not stored. 
I'll keep that in mind. 
I'm serious. 
All those times you told me to make the explosions smaller, I shouldn't have listened to you, Then paxson wouldn't have anything to hang you with. 
when you're concerned you might be walking into a police stakeout, there are a number of things to look out for  parked cars or vans... 
Hold on, fi. 
...workers that seem 
unusually preoccupied... 
and curious kids. 
no matter where you go in the world, little boys like candy, puppies, and cops. 
I think our detective friend had a surprise planned. 
Mr. westen. 
Detective paxson and detective forget-your-name. 
You know, i was thinking about renting one of these storage units. 
You mind if i look at yours? 
Storage unit? 
Yes, or you could give us The fake name you used when you rented it. 
Or go ahead and clear it out. 
don't let us stop you. 
I think there's been a big misunderstanding. 
I actually heard you were in the neighborhood, And i came by to see you. 
Yeah, i wanted to give you some receipts  You know, give you a better idea Of what i've been doing, where i've been going. 
That one's for breakfast. 
fi had a spanish omelet. 
Egg whites only. 
thank you. 
Well, if you get the urge to destroy any evidence, Stop by. 
We'll be waiting for you. 
Was that flirting, or does she hate you? 
I am not her type. 
Yeah, sam? 
Hey, mike, you ready to do this? i'm all set. 
Seriously, though, i think this is a little risky. 
I'm on my way. 
when it comes to cover i.d.s, 
impersonating a bad cop is much better than impersonating a good one. 
an honest cop follows policies and procedures, from the way he cuts his hair to the approach he takes when carrying out a traffic stop. 
pose as a good cop, and you have to go by the book. 
pose as a bad cop, and you can throw out that book and write your own. 
Hi, there. 
detective finley. 
Wow, nice seats. 
What is that, pearl leather? 
Let me call my lawyer. 
he can tell you all about them. 
all right, just relax. 
I'm here unofficially. 
Just think of this as... 
a business meeting. 
You want to do a business meeting? 
How about you make an appointment? 
 okay. 
When's a good time to talk about someone Who's trying to move in on one of your scores? 
Just worked a drug bust. 
Heard something that might interest you. 
in the criminal world, selling yourself as a colleague often means doing something illegal. 
so while snorting lactose isn't pleasant... 
...it may put 
people's minds at ease. 
Oh ho! got this 
on the bust, too. 
90% pure. mmm! 
Puts hair on your chest, i'll tell you that. 
What's this you heard about a score? 
Yeah, it was a coke buy down in overtown. 
Busted a guy i know, a junkie named shep. 
So, he's trying to get me to lay off him 'cause he says he knows something about a plan To, uh, rip you off. 
Some junkie told you this? 
Yeah, he's a snitch. 
Hey, the guy's a mess, but his intel's usually good. 
So, why'd you bust him? 
Well, i take him in every so often just to keep him in line. 
So, listen, i'm taking him to the station. 
For a couple of grand... 
You can question him first. 
Interested? 
He said something about a kid, if that means anything. 
A kid? 
Yeah, he didn't say much more than that. 
Man, i cannot get over this leather. 
It's hand-tooled, right? 
Where is this guy? 
Madeline: so, what you're saying is, Michael's missing his own birthday party?! 
H-he's busy. 
Busy? 
Busy being shot at or busy get blown up? 
Does he ever take a day off? 
Ow! damn it! 
I mean, you know... 
A little consideration is all i'm asking. 
I'm making an effort. 
so should he. 
Well, he seems to be making progress. 
Don't fool yourself, honey. 
Loving michael is always trench warfare. 
Hmm. 
You tell him to come to the party. 
Sam: busted a few raves here. 
Don't worry. 
no one comes around now. 
Place is condemned. 
It's where i do my, uh, freelance work. 
So, the snitch is in there. 
you got my money? 
Here you go. 
i'll take it from here. 
Oh, oh, no, my friend. 
That's not how it works. 
We question this guy together. 
No offense, but i don't like people knowing my business. 
Yeah, no offense, but i don't care. 
Your business doesn't concern me. 
What concerns me is nobody touches my prisoner but me. 
I got my own way of asking questions. 
Yeah, and i got to explain every scratch on the guy When i take him down to the station. 
So if you want to come down there with me, that's fine. 
Otherwise, we do this my way. 
And what about later? 
This guy shep gets to mouth off? 
don't worry about that. 
I got enough on this guy to send him to prison on the moon. 
He'll keep his mouth shut. 
Santora: so, nobody knows you got this guy here, huh? 
Sam:  don't get any ideas. 
As far as my supervisor's concerned, I'm working on a case. 
Officially, i'm in the middle of interviewing you, So if anything happens to me, He knows who to come looking for. 
Let's do this. 
So, i don't know you... 
But i hear you know me... 
And my business. 
interrogation professionals don't ask questions directly. 
they hide what they know and don't know. 
Aw, you're a real prince, finley, A real stand-up guy. 
After all i've done for you, this is what i get? 
Nothing personal. 
just business. 
amateurs tend to ask for exactly what they want. 
Who told you about the kid? 
it's like playing poker with your cards showing. 
I think your buddy here wants to kiss me, finley. 
Hey, i'm not that type. 
Ugh! 
Answer the question. 
Sam: who told you? 
A friend of a friend. 
I didn't get his name. 
They didn't give me details. 
i didn't ask for them. 
All right, tell me about this job. 
They needed help moving a -- a kid. 
They wanted a place that they could stash him For a few days off the street. 
I found it. 
can i go now? 
You can go when i find out what the hell is going on. 
The guy who hired you  He say when they were planning this? 
Oh, come on, you think they're gonna tell me when? 
Yeah, right after they told me Their vacation plans and their social security numbers. 
I don't know. 
You got a smart mouth. 
Maybe you should start using it to save your ass. 
They told me... 
to find a place... 
Where they could stash the kid... 
For a few days. 
Do you want me to say that slower? 
Where'd you meet them? 
Right. 
do you think i'm stupid? 
I tell you that, And you're gonna go tell them and i'm gonna get killed. 
You worry about that later. 
you got more immediate problems. 
Ugh! 
all right, all right. 
All right. 
It was a restaurant  a diner, i think. 
when people are desperate for information, they start filling in the blanks, often without realizing it. 
it's something fortune-tellers rely on. 
it works pretty much the same way for spies. 
Think harder. 
although fortune-tellers usually don't get smacked around as much. 
It was a diner. 
It had burgers and fries. 
The seaside diner? 
Was that it? 
off the causeway? 
Yes. thank you. 
I met the guy at the seaside diner. 
What'd this guy look like? 
Well, i don't know. 
H-he was a guy. 
Was a white guy, maybe. 
"white"? 
I'm just gonna go out in miami and look for a white guy? 
You're gonna have to do better than that. 
No! all right, all right, 
all right! 
It was  it was  the waitress knew him. 
She called him "flowers." 
They knew him there. 
And that's it. that's  
that's -- that's all i know. 
Man: yeah, this is jimmy. 
Get over to the seaside diner now. 
Ask around for a guy named flowers. 
Surprising how much a guy remembers When you help him out a little. 
Listen, this is taking longer than i thought. 
I got to make a call. 
you two play nice. 
Fi, get over to the seaside diner. 
It's off macarthur causeway. 
santora is sending a guy there. 
You might be able to tail him back to brandon. 
Just stay out of sight, all right? 
Fiona: stay out of sight? 
You're seriously telling me that? 
Well, it's nothing personal. 
Things are just getting a little tense around here. 
So, you and your friends thought that you could rip me off? 
That right? what was 
the plan with the kid? 
I told you everything i know. 
i was supposed to get  What was the plan?! 
I was paid a lousy 150 bucks for this job. 
You think i don't want to tell you? 
Put the knife away!! 
You've got a sharp knife!! 
Michael: get that knife out of my face! 
Fi, just go now. 
Aah! 
Fine. 
You want to  you want to know the plan? 
Yeah, i do. 
All right, well, You're never gonna know the plan with a knife, Because cutting me up ain't gonna turn me into a mind reader! 
Whoa, there, friend. 
My prisoner... 
My rules, remember? 
Now, you want me to lean on him, All you have to do is ask. 
We clear? 
Now, put it away. 
We may have a lead on brandon's location. 
You're going to get him now? 
If things go according to plan. 
I'll come with you. 
i can help. 
Well, that's sweet and very brave, But you are gonna get yourself shot. 
Well, if that's what it takes to get our son back, i don't care. 
Brandon is gonna need you alive. 
Getting shot sounds noble Until it actually happens to you. 
Don't volunteer for it unless it's absolutely necessary. 
Brandon's gonna be fine. 
I know it. 
You want to do something for your son? 
Don't forget this moment. 
Yeah. 
And don't ever work together. 
Not all couples can handle it. 
Okay, so, this flowers  He show you where the kid is? 
No, t-t-they drove me through the neighborhood  T-the route they were gonna take. 
I don't remember  I've had enough of you-don't-remember. 
No more warnings. 
I've answered all your questions. 
I want you to tell me who is trying to rip me off! 
And i want a house on star island, Filled with strippers and bikinis, But wishing just doesn't make it so, man! 
It's time to focus. 
Now, listen, i assume there isn't a sign on the place That says "the kid is here," So how would he know if he saw it? 
Come on, you got guys with the kid? 
maybe shep saw them. 
Yeah, i got two guys. 
michael: yeah, could be. 
I saw a couple of guys, but i didn't talk to them. 
i don't know their names. 
Did you see the kid? 
no. 
Okay, santora, so calm down. 
he didn't see the kid. 
Maybe it's not the same place. 
He didn't see him because the kid Is in a shed behind the house! 
Now shut up and let me think! 
searching for a concealed enemy who could be anywhere is a waste of time. 
Yeah, it's jimmy. 
Nobody's heard of "flowers" at the diner. 
usually, your best bet is to stay put and give your enemy a reason to come to you. 
What's going on? 
Is there something i should know about? 
Don't worry about it. 
Just get back to the house and watch the kid. 
to tail someone, you need both skill and instinct. 
you need skill because the driving is tough. 
you can't get too close, and you can't drift too far away. 
you can't go too fast or too slow. 
you need instinct because every turn, every lane change, every bridge raises the risk of being seen. 
anyone can be trained to follow a car. 
but it takes good instincts to know when it's time to stop following. 
So, i had one of my guys ask around. 
No one at that restaurant Ever heard of anyone named flowers. 
Why is that m-my fault? 
Maybe he went to the wrong place. 
He went to the diner, you lying son of a bitch. 
Why would i lie to you? 
That's it. 
I'm shutting this thing down before it gets any worse. 
when you work with someone long enough, you learn to trust them. 
when things go bad, that trust is the difference between life and death. 
of course, knowing that doesn't make it less terrifying to back a play you know nothing about. 
Listen, uh... 
I know this guy, shep. 
I mean, he's a pain in the ass, but his information is good. 
Yeah? because he told 
me some story about a guy who doesn't exist? 
Maybe the guy does exist. 
He could be one of your own guys. 
So, one more time... 
This flowers guy... 
What did he look like? 
He has, uh, slicked-back hair. 
He was a muscle guy. 
Uh... 
He wears those muscle shirts, You know, to show off his arms. 
That's the best i can do. 
that's all i got. 
That's flowers? 
you're sure? 
Yeah, that's the guy who told me about the kid. 
Ugh! 
Hey, hey! 
What is wrong with you? 
Santora: that's my guy. 
Like you said, my own guy is trying to steal from me. 
What guy? 
His name's jimmy. 
The guy i sent to the diner to look for flowers  it turns out the son of a bitch is flowers. 
He's supposed to be watching the kid. 
Instead, he's planning to rip me off. 
You know, you can call it off. 
Let the kid go. 
Hell, just give him to me. 
I'll tell his parents i found him wandering around. 
It's too late for that. 
He saw my face. 
it's over. 
I got to clean this whole mess up. 
Whoa, whoa, what are you gonna with that? 
Listen, you've been a stand-up guy. 
I appreciate that. 
And i don't want to cause you problems. 
But that guy in there, shep... 
He's got to die. 
Now. 
every profession has occupational hazards. 
butchers cut themselves, house painters fall off ladders, and operatives get asked to help kill their own people. 
 hey. 
you watch it, friend. 
I got unis checking on my interview. 
Back off. 
This is my snitch. 
I got to be able to explain what goes on. 
My own guys are turning on me. 
If he's part of it, he's got to go. 
They all do. 
Oh, i see, so i'm just supposed to sit back And hope none of this blows back on me? 
No way, pal. 
that's not how this goes down. 
You got any ideas? 
i'm listening. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, i say that, uh... 
Dropped him off by the road. 
I let him out 'cause he was sick from the dope. 
I'll just tell them that  that he attacked me, And he tried to escape. 
Wait, you? 
Yeah. don't you remember? 
he's my prisoner. 
How am i gonna explain a suspect That's full of these random bullet holes? 
We'll have the damn fbi here. 
it's better this way. 
Put a few rounds in his chest with my gun, But you do it out by the road, you understand? 
Your gun? what the hell 
are you talking about? 
Look, i got to be able to sell this story to my department. 
If i don't, they're coming after me. 
Trust me, it's better this way. 
Come on, come on. 
All right. 
I'll go get shep. 
You get your guy on the phone. 
you tell him to sit tight. 
I don't want this situation any worse than it already is. 
Michael: oh! 
You all right, mike? 
Yeah. you still pack 
a pretty good punch, sam. 
Yeah, well, the good news is Santora's planning on going back to the kid. 
Fi followed their guy. 
They're holed up on an island off the causeway. 
And the bad news? 
Santora wants to kill you first. 
I convinced him to do it with my gun Up on the side of the road, Make it look like you were trying to get away. 
How far is the road? 
A couple hundred yards. 
I guess it'll have to do. 
Mike, if there was any other way... 
There isn't. 
All right, when you get free, Take his car and head to the causeway. 
I'll get you the address. 
Good luck, mikey. 
Santora: hey. 
Let's take a walk. 
Listen, listen, you don't want to do this. 
This -- i could tell you more. 
I could tell you about flowers and the plan. 
Man, you don't want to do this. 
I know plenty already. 
I mean, why shut this down? 
There's money to be made here, man. 
I-i could help you. 
we could split it 50/50. 
 oh, yeah? 
 i don't want to die, man! 
Please... 
Please, i'm begging you! 
He got away. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
Where's my gun? 
He took it! 
He's got my gun? 
we got to find him! now! 
Could he be going to meet up with jimmy? 
I don't know. maybe. 
And you told jimmy to stay put with the kid? 
Yeah. 
where's the house? 
We don't have time for this! 
where's the house?! 
Hibiscus island. 
What address? 
I got to know! 
they got my gun! 
Look, if i go down for this, so do you! 
1313 prospect street. 
what are you doing? 
They have a security office on the island. 
I'll ask if they've seen him. 
Yeah, sam? 
Yeah, this is officer finley, uh, miami p.d. 
I'd like to know if you've seen anyone Go to 1313 prospect street. 
Uh, there's someone going there right now. 
Fi, i got the address. 
people underestimate the tactical importance of tv in urban warfare. 
guard duty's boring, and a ballgame passes the time better than, say, looking for intruders. 
more battles have been decided by pennant races than people imagine. 
Fiona: brandon? 
We're gonna take you back to your mom and dad, okay? 
Santora: the junkie's here. 
We do him and jimmy first, then the kid. 
Okay, you cut through the backyard, I'll cover you from the front? 
Okay. 
Have fun in there, you son of a bitch. 
Look who's here. 
You thought you could steal from me? 
What the hell are you saying? 
where's the kid? 
I said where's the kid?! 
I don't know! 
he was just there! 
I know what you did, jimmy. 
I know you're flowers. 
i know everything. 
I don't know what you're talking about. get that 
thing out of my face! 
Put it down now! you picked 
the wrong guy to double-cross! 
I did everything you ever said! 
you sold me out to a junkie! 
it's always best to have business arguments unarmed. 
when tempers are high and everyone's got a gun, you never know what's going to set someone off. 
Jimmy, jimmy, don't  I don't know what to say. 
You don't have to say anything. 
Think about leaving miami. 
You don't want to be around if santora's friends come looking. 
Oh, we weren't planning to be. 
We've, uh, talked about making a fresh start Somewhere else, together. 
Patricia: thank you... 
For everything. 
You ready? 
A fresh start...together. 
Kind of inspiring, don't you think? 
I'd settle for staying out of jail. 
Come on, fi, we got a date... 
With the storage unit. 
when a front door is being watched, your best option oftentimes is just to make a back door. 
if you don't mind getting damp, a water saw is a great tool for the job. 
it will cut through the wall much more quietly than a metal saw and won't ignite anything flammable that happens to be lying around. 
Hey, detective, uh, would you like to come in? 
I have some more receipts. 
Cute. 
You know, i finally did get a look at that storage unit That didn't belong to you. 
Find anything interesting? 
Yeah, i found a hole in the back of the wall And a puddle of water inside. 
Yeah, the heavy rains the other night Must have done some funny things. 
This isn't over. 
Did you make this? 
You like it? 
I wanted this to be special, so i cooked. 
It's good. 
Happy birthday, mike. 
Beer. a five-pack. 
thanks. 
Yeah, it's imported. 
It's supposed to be brewed by some monks in belgium. 
It's, uh... 
It's really good, or, you know, so i heard. 
Would you like some? 
Yeah, thanks. 
Sam: it's kind of pricy, But i figured only the best for you, mike. 
Would you like a bottle opener, sam? 
Oh, no, no, i got one. 
thanks. yeah. 
I never leave home without it. 
Sam, you need a bottle opener. 
Why don't i show you where it is? 
Okay. sure. 
It's a bayonet. 
Used during the first world war for close fighting. 
Fi... 
Thanks? 
Well, someone once told me That caring for you is like trench warfare. 
So I thought you should arm yourself. 
 Bierdopje.com 
Now, Robot, kick 'em in the knees. 
Bears have weak knees. 
And you should vibrate, 'cause the robot's full of radiation. 
Yeah, that's it. 
Frank. 
How many bears did I say you could have? 
One. 
And how many do you see here? 
Um, four? 
Save a little money for the rest of us, Frank. 
You can't spend a bunch of money on bear suits that are only gonna be seen for, like, 25 seconds. 
Liz, nobody's gonna believe that a killer robot can get his ass kicked by one bear. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
You're trying to bring logic to the robot-bear sketch? 
You can't have four bears. 
Well, how many can I keep? 
One! 
Sorry, guys. 
Uh, who did my Sudoku puzzle? 
I have been looking forward to this puzzle all morning. 
Hey, Liz, could you come up to my office when you have a free moment? 
I never have a free moment, Jack. 
Never, ever. 
Really punch him. 
Like karate. 
Are you familiar with the Japanese art of Reiki? 
No. 
It is the laying-on of hands in order to improve one's life. 
Hm, how does your life improve? 
Do the hands have money in them? 
Human contact is important, Lemon. 
I can tell from your stress level that you have not been touched in any way in quite some time. 
Not caress?? 
Not massaged. 
Not even groped on the subway. 
Where are you headed with this? 
Your mood affects the quality of your work, which, in turn, affects me. 
I would like to become a resource to you for improving your personal life. 
Do you agree that you need someone in your life, Lemon? 
No, I have bigger things to worry about than my personal life. 
I would think that a single woman's biggest worry would be choking to death alone in her apartment. 
I have a friend in town I'd like to set you up with. 
No, thank you. 
Thomas is very bright, has a wonderful sense of humor. 
I think it's a good match. 
Are you free on Thursday? 
No, Thursday is poker night. 
And by the way, it is completely inappropriate for you to be questioning me about my private life, and then trying to set me up with someone when you don't even know anything about me. 
Poker night? 
Who plays? 
Really? 
That's all you got out of that? 
I enjoy poker, and I'd be interested in seeing my new employees under that kind of pressure. 
You're not gonna come to our crappy poker game, are you? 
No, I'm not. 
Good. 
I bluffed. 
Yes, I am coming. 
Three can't go here. 
Three can't go here. 
It can go here. 
Fine, I'll meet your friend. 
So who is this Thomas guy? 
Oh, I don't know. 
He's one of Jack's friends. 
Oh, my God, isn't Jack friends with Tom DeLay? 
Am I going on a date with Tom DeLay? 
Ugh, why did I say I would do this? 
I haven't been on a date since Dennis and I broke up, and that was almost a year ago. 
It's gonna be a complete disaster. 
It's just one date. 
But if it is Tom DeLay and you do go home with him, be prepared for it to get weird. 
Josh, you and me. 
Thursday night. 
I know this guy that runs an underground bird fight. 
Oh, yeah. 
I can't do that. 
Thursday's poker night here. 
Guys, we just need to try the green screen stuff one more time. 
Poker night? 
I love poker. 
I used to play all kinds of poker with my aunt. 
Crazy Seven. 
Albuquerque Freakout. 
One Card Stud. 
Yeah, I don't think those are real games. 
Whatever. 
Get ready to get took. 
No, Mom, I can't make it Friday. 
I gotta work. 
Hey, Frank? 
Hold on. 
Yeah. 
What do guys like?  
Uh, porn. 
No, I mean, if you were gonna go on a date with a woman, how would you want her to act? 
Like she was in a porn. 
Hey, Lemon. 
You're on for 8:00 for dinner at Caf� des Artistes. 
Really? 
Wow. What? 
What are you gonna wear? 
This, probably. 
I don't have time to go home. 
No,  that won't do. 
I want you to go out on your lunch hour, and find something. 
At a women's clothing store. 
Remind me what's better. 
A pair of black Aces or a pair of red Aces? 
You guys, I'm leaving. 
All right. 
All right. 
Check out the valley. 
Look at that. 
Hey, look at you! 
You look like a fancy prostitute. 
Okay, I got my chair. 
I got my beer. 
I got my lucky donut. 
Oh, is there room for one more? 
Yeah, sure. 
Really? 
That's fantastic. 
Could we just, uh Yes, yes, yes. 
Donaghy, what up? 
What up, Tray? 
This round, Texas Doozy. 
Face cards are wild. 
Threes are jinx. 
Fives are twos. 
Tray, do you mind if I deal this hand? 
Be my guest. 
Show me love. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the minimum bet in this game is $25. 
Oh, Jack, we usually just play for quarters. 
Well, then you best go home and put on your daddy's shoes, boy. 
'Cause this is a man's game. 
I call. 
And I'll see that with... 
This thing. 
I call. 
Pair of Jacks. 
Ace high. 
Three cowboys. 
Oh, my God. 
My wedding ring. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Now, you should all learn from Pete's mistake. 
My  wife's gonna kill me! 
You see, in poker as in business, the key to success is to determine your opponent's strength and, more importantly, his weaknesses. 
Everyone has a tell a weakness of character that manifests itself physically. 
Oh. 
Like when Lutz here has a good hand, he stops eating. 
When Frank is bluffing, he asks a series of insane questions to hide his nervousness. 
Oh, really? 
Is that what you think? 
Is that what I do? 
Am I doing that right now? 
Yeah, I'm out. 
Okay, Rainman, tell me what I got. 
Well, you have two of your cards backwards actually. 
I'm out. 
Hi. 
Pinot grigio, please. 
This is beyond the pale. 
Donaghy took me for $200. 
Yeah, well I bet my rent money. 
And if I don't pay by the tenth, my mom's gonna throw me out. 
I'm all in. 
Anybody else? 
Oh, I'll play with you, Mr. Donaghy. 
Kenneth, how long you been sitting there? 
I'm taking Pete's place, 'cause he's busy in the bathroom, laying in his own sick. 
Oh, my God. 
He can't read Kenneth. 
He's a blank slate. 
Okay, what do you got? 
I think I have what they refer to as a royal flush. 
Looks like I'm the big winner. 
Thank you. 
Liz, hi. 
I'm Gretchen Thomas. 
Jack's friend. 
Hey. 
Great to meet you. 
Hi. 
Why would Jack just assume that we're lesbians? 
I am a lesbian. 
Mm, that's awesome. 
Is this the first time somebody's made that assumption about you? 
Lemon, don't let these girls give you a hard time about who you are. 
You know, you need to brush your teeth more, young man. 
Oh, my. 
What an adorable little lesbian. 
What? 
I don't know. 
Who remembers that kind of thing? 
Well, look, obviously this is a miscommunication. 
I mean, I'm certainly not interested in chasing a straight girl. 
Of course, yeah. 
I completely understand if you just want to go home. 
No, it's fine. 
I'll stay. 
Jack is ridiculous. 
Oh, I worked with Jack in Plastics. 
He tends to approach everything the same way. 
Locate the problem. 
Isolate the problem. 
Set the problem up with a lesbian. 
That's a pretty good joke for somebody from Plastics. 
Well, I wasn't always in Plastics. 
I used to work in Water and Process Technologies. 
Working mainly in primary metals. 
Oh, so you have a comedy background. 
How was your evening with Thomas? 
You mean, Gretchen Thomas? 
The brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian? 
What made you think I was gay? 
Your shoes. 
Well, I'm straight. 
Those shoes are definitely bi-curious. 
Regardless, I am straight. 
100% completely straight. 
Well, I'm sorry if I offended you. 
No, I'm not offended Good. 
What do you know about Kenneth the page? 
I don't know. 
He's a sweet kid. 
Yes. 
And  a surprisingly good poker player. 
Did you know that his middle name is Ellen? 
No, that's weird. 
And that his Myers-Briggs-psychological testing shows shows a rare combination of extroverted, intuitive and aggressive? 
Really? 
The same as mine. 
He could be trouble down the line. 
Kenneth. 
Kenneth Ellen. 
All right then. 
You're not a lesbian. 
Duly noted. 
I'll correct that on your file. 
It's too bad, though. 
Thomas thought you were great. 
 She did? 
 Yes. 
She said she thought you looked like Jennifer Jason Leigh. 
Really? 
She said that? 
Yes, I made her repeat it. 
I was sure she meant Jason Lee. 
Miss Lemon. 
Yeah. 
This is Pete's wedding ring. 
I won it last night, but I don't think I should keep it. 
Could you give it back to him for me? 
Yeah, okay. 
Did you win this, too? 
I did. 
I love how the light catches it like diamonds. 
Kenneth, it is diamonds. 
Ah. 
Hi, Mr. Donaghy. 
Can I help you with something? 
You are a puzzle... 
Kenneth Ellen. 
And I'm going to solve you. 
Yes, I am. 
I can't believe you bet your wedding ring. 
I know. 
The weird thing is I had money left. 
Hey, um, what famous person would you say I look like? 
Uh, present day Linda Ronstadt. 
No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  
Tootsie. 
Never mind. 
So how was your date? 
It wasn't a good match. 
What happened? 
 Did he notice your facial tic? 
 No. 
Did you wear sandals? 
 Did he see your toes? 
 No. 
You  blew it, didn't you? 
Good job, Liz. 
Way to go. 
Another one bites the dust. 
Ah, look at your little face. 
It was a lady. 
Are you serious? 
Where is my Emmy? 
Hello? 
Hi, Gretchen. 
It's Liz Lemon. 
Oh, hi. 
Look, thiss gonna sound really weird, but, um, do you every worry about choking to death alone in your apartment? 
Oh, it's so weird you would say that. 
I think about it all the time. 
I mean, you'd die, and they wouldn't find you until your neighbor's dog smelled you from the hallway. 
Ugh, yes, and they'd show a picture of you on New York One. 
And it's not just choking. 
Ever since I turned 30, every time I get in or out of the bathtub, I think in my head, "Careful, careful." 
Yes! 
Agh. 
Everything's the worst. 
Do you want to get some dinner? 
Sure. 
 See you in 20 at Neptune. 
Yeah, okay. 
Perfect, yeah. 
Oh! 
Ow, ow, ow! 
I did not die. 
Man, this is amazing. 
Oh, hey, Jack. 
Welcome. 
Welcome, everybody. 
Damn, Jack, you went all out. 
That's a giant shrimp. 
Made out of shrimp and diving into a bowl of shrimp. 
Please, enjoy it, Tracy. 
Hey, Pete, good to see you. 
Jack. 
Is Kenneth here? 
I--I will check. 
I've been playing for two hours. 
I'm tired of losing. 
I'm gonna let my boy, Dotcom, play a hand for me. 
So, hey, Dotcom, are we going to those three clubs tonight? 
You know the doctor said I have four hearts in my body? 
All right. 
Great. 
Of course he did. 
Come on. Damn it. 
Hey, everybody, this is Gretchen. 
Oh, hey. 
Oh, Thomas. 
Jack. 
How's everybody up there in Pittsfield? 
Oh, we miss you. 
I love this woman. 
Let's play some poker. 
I call. 
What have you got, Kenneth? 
All clovers. 
I win. 
Very clever boy, Kenneth. 
But the curtain has been drawn back now, and I know the real you. 
I think he's confusing me with someone else. 
Liz, are you sure you're not gay? 
'Cause that chick is hot. 
We're just friends, like Oprah and Gayle. 
Why is that so hard for everybody to believe? 
She's great. 
You should marry that girl. 
One problem. 
I'm not gay. 
Oh, Lemon, in the ten years that I've known you, you've had some really terrible boyfriends. 
I have. 
There was the guy who was obsessed with Charlie Chaplin. 
Neil. 
There was the guy who played Halo under the name Slutbanger. 
Dennis. 
There was a tall, gangly, red-haired guy who played guitar all the time. 
Conan. 
You're more relaxed with Gretchen than you were with any of those guys. 
So what are you saying, Pete? 
I should just be a lesbian? 
Well, I'm not saying it'll be easy. 
You know, get drunk first. 
Why do guys think women can just flip a switch like that? 
What if I said to you, "Go be with Frank now"? 
Ah, I would be honored. 
Frank is a very tender, beautiful man. 
He's awesome. 
You can't read his thoughts, 'cause he doesn't have any. 
I raise you 200. 
And I see your 200 and raise you 300. 
Will you, little Kenneth Ellen Parcell from Stone Mountain, Georgia? 
Growing up in your momma's tract house, dreaming of working on a TV show? 
Dreaming of making it all the way to the NBC. 
You're scaring me, Mr. Donaghy. 
You've come a long way, haven't you, Kenneth Ellen? 
With your cheap loafers and your page jacket, but you'll always be a pig farmer's son, boy. 
'Cause I smell fried bologna all over you. 
I'm all in. 
I'm out of chips, Mr. Donaghy. 
Hey, I got a fun idea. 
You put your page jacket on the table, and if you win, you can get it back. 
If you lose, you go on home. 
You go on home, little Kenneth Ellen. 
All the way to Stone Mountain. 
He's bluffing. 
Go for it. 
He's bluffing. 
Come on, trust yourself. 
Trust yourself. 
Don't do it. 
No! 
You can do it. 
Okay, okay. 
Come on. 
Use your instincts. 
You've got good instincts. 
Do it, Kenneth. 
I've got a pair of twos. 
Well, let's just see-weeby here. 
I've got a two, a four, a nine, a six, and a King. 
That means I win. 
Kenneth. 
Why did you bet  that terrible hand? 
Why? 
Because...I believe 
that life is for the living. 
I believe in taking risks and biting off more than you can chew. 
And also, people were yelling, and I got confused about the rules. 
Kenneth. 
I wasn't really going to fire you. 
I  just wanted to remind you that I could. 
I want you back here at 6:00 in the morning sharp so you can sweep up these shrimp tails. 
Yes, sir, Mr. Donaghy. 
Uh, I'm gonna have my eye on you, Kenneth. 
You will not be disappointed, sir. 
Well, it was nice of you to let him keep his job. 
The Italians have a saying, Lemon. 
"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer." 
And although they've never won a war, or mass-produced a decent car, in this area, they are correct. 
In five years, we'll all either be working for him... 
or be dead by his hand. 
Hey, after Ikea tomorrow, you wanna go see Margaret Cho at the Beacon? 
Oh, boy. 
Um, Oprah? 
Yes, Gayle. 
I think we need to take a break. 
Is this because I waused to submit us for The Amazing Race? 
Because I was 80% joking about that. 
No, it's You know, I said I'm not into chasing straight girls. 
And I kinda think that's what's starting to happen here. 
So... unless you're ready to make 
a big life change, I need to move on, find my Steadman. 
I thought I was Oprah in this metaphor. 
Also, you're gay, so that's a little confusing. 
You should say, like, "My lady Steadman." 
Okay. 
I'm going out on a limb here. 
Okay, sorry. 
Um, it's just If I try to imagine us being together, I think, "Yeah, okay, this could be fun, you know? 
"Picking out furniture and making flower beds out of old railroad ties." 
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be with someone, it has to be a guy. 
You sound pretty sure about that. 
What can I say? 
I love a bald spot and a hairy back. 
You're alone there. 
I should go. 
I'll see you around. 
Okay, wait. 
Um, what if we made a pact? 
What if we say that in, like, 25 years, if neither of us has someone, we'll move in together and be roommates. 
And even though I am not into the sex stuff, if it helps you... I would let you... 
do stuff to me. 
I can't be around you anymore. 
Bye, Liz. 
That's funny. 
That's what the guys always say. 
Who's gonna go with me to cooking class next weekend? 
Well, if by "cooking class" you mean your bed, and by "next weekend" you mean tonight Oh, shut up. 
I can see your wedding ring. 
Idiot. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman That was hillarious! 
We're back in two minutes! 
So are you going to ask out the Head? 
The Head? 
There are these two MSNBC guys we keep seeing around, and we don't know their names, so we call them the Head and the Hair. 
How come? 
So what are you, like 6'2"? 
6'5". 
Wow. 
I see you're looking at my watch. 
What? 
It's cool, isn't it? 
That's a Japanese pie watch. 
Oh, okay. 
It tells time with those little pie pieces. 
Each piece is six minutes. 
So right now, it's six times four. 
5:30. That can't be right. 
My watch has these little hands that go around and point at numbers. 
Hey, that's awesome, possum. 
One minute! 
The point is, the Hair is ridiculously good looking. 
It's true. 
He makes me nervous just to be around. 
And the Head is perfectly harmless and totally into Ms. Liz Lemon. 
Hmm... 
Not as much as he's into his pie watch. 
I think the Head sounds perfect for you right now. 
I mean, low pressure, high nerd factor, come on. 
If you're serious about getting your personal life on track, you need to work at it. 
Okay, fine! 
I'll ask him out. 
I win. 
No, the French maid werewolf thing is cut. 
You're supposed to be Hillary Clinton right now. 
What? Pete! 
 Gary! 
 Lutz! 
What do you think sounds like the better idea for a new show? 
A talk show without a host, just the voice of the dead lady from Desperate Housewives, or a reality show with a lot of super hot nannies who move into a house and help fat kids lose weight? 
Never mind. 
This television programming stuff is just one unpredictable ass ache, and I want you to get it out of here. 
Kenneth, please. 
Come in. 
Is this about the clementine I took off the actors' snack table? 
Because the catering lady already talked to me. 
No, no. 
No, I wanted to talk to you about our corporate "Bottoms Up" day. 
Once a year, all the Senior VPs spend one day doing the job of one of our lowest level employees. 
Last year I was a welder at one of our locomotive factories, and I made this. 
And this year, I'll be a page for a day, and you'll be my boss. 
Thank you, sir. 
That's how the "Bottoms Up" program works. 
I'm going to be your bottom, Kenneth. 
And I want you to ride me as hard as you can. 
Dude, this party was messed up! 
They had girls dancing in cages. 
And not the go-go cages, the little dog cages that you crate pit bulls in. 
That is awesome. 
 That is upsetting. 
 That is awesome. 
It couldn't have been that great a party. 
You're on time to work for the first time ever. 
January 17th. 
Write it down, Cerie. 
It's historic. 
How dare you, Liz Lemon? 
I'm not arriving to work. 
I left the party on a bacon run. 
Write it down, Cerie. 
January 17th. 
Just like every other day. 
Oh, what's today's date? 
January 17th. 
2007? 
 Yeah. 
 Ah, dammit! 
I knew this was going to happen. 
Toofer, pass me some paper. 
What's wrong? 
My autobiography is due tomorrow. 
Morning, boss. 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
Well, don't let it happen again. 
Are you ready for an exciting and challenging day? 
You bet. 
(Tracy) Yo! 
Me, Toofer, and Frank are gonna be writing my book all day long, and I think my snake is sick, so I need you to go out to my car and rub his belly 'til he poops. 
Our first assignment. 
This is so annoying.  
I just went down to the ATM to get money, and it gave me a hundred-dollar bill. 
 So? 
 So? 
It's like having Confederate money. 
No one's going to take that. 
Whatever. 
It'll give you something interesting to talk to the Head about. 
Oh, yeah. Am I doing that? 
Yeah, right now. 
Hi, can I help you? 
Yes, I'm looking for... the Head? 
The  head of what? 
Yeah, how am I going to do this? 
Hi. What are you doing up here? 
Oh, Chris Matthews owes me ten bucks. 
Yeah, you'll never get that. 
My name is Gray, by the way. 
You know, it's kind of funny. 
My friend Jenna and I didn't know your name, so we've been calling you the Hair. 
The Hair? 
How would you like it if I called you Glasses? 
I would be fine with that. 
Oh, good, because that's what I've been calling you. 
Which was no help when I was trying to find your extension. 
Why were you trying to find my extension? 
I have a friend who's opening up a new restaurant in SoHo, and I was hoping that you'd go with me. 
What? 
Do you want to go out with me tonight? 
Why? 
Because it would be fun. 
And you seem cool. 
What? 
1979. 
I was looking for some money in my mother's room, and I found  some naked pictures under her mattress. 
She was just sitting there in her house coat, holding one of her boobs like this. 
I knew she must have taken those pictures for her boyfriend Sonny. 
Because Sonny used to come over twice a month. 
You knew when Sonny was coming over, 'cause she would take us to the store and buy two steaks and a bottle of Nair with cocoa butter. 
How many pages do we have now? 
Five. 
Make the letters bigger, Toof. 
According to Wikipedia, you were discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984. 
I have no memory of that. 
Write it up. 
Here is your salad. 
And your change. 
Oh, no. 
Dude, is this spinach? 
Yes,  you, uh You asked for a spinach salad. 
No, I like the stuff that comes on the spinach salad, but I wanted it with romaine. 
So you want me to take it back? 
I'm supposed to treat you like Kenneth, right? 
Yes. 
Well, then, yeah, genius. 
Get me a new salad. 
Or get me a time machine so I can go back in time and smack your mom for smoking crack while she's pregnant. 
Too much? 
No, that's usually how it goes. 
Hey, what happened? 
Did you ask him? 
Well, I was going to. 
Oh, Liz. 
But before I could, the Hair asked me out. 
What? The the Hair? 
What did you say? 
I had to say yes. 
He looked at me with those crazy handsome-guy eyes. 
It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon is No, Liz. 
Do not talk about stuff like that on your date. 
Guys like that do not like Star Trek. 
Wars! 
I'm sorry. 
You're right. 
I don't go out on dates with guys like Gray. 
It feels wrong. 
He's the Hair, and I am a Head-plus, at best. 
Or maybe you really are the Hair and I'm the Head in our relationship. 
Oh, God, no. 
Something is wrong with this. 
I have upset the natural balance of things. 
Good morning, ladies. 
I'm making a coffee run. 
Would either of you care for anything? 
Liz and Jenna, nothing. 
What's happening? 
I don't know. 
Good God, what does that man doing here? 
I don't know. 
I've never met Brian Williams, but his dressing room has to be cleaned up every day between 11 and 11:30. 
That way, by the time Mr. Williams 
gets back from the liquor store, it's nice and tidy. 
Kenneth, a friend of mine tipped me off about a position in our aviation division. 
It's entry level only, of course. 
Is this tube sock filled with bird seed? 
Yes, sir. 
Just put it in the basket with the others. 
At any rate, I'd be happy to put in a good word for you. 
What? 
And leave show business? 
No, thank you. 
Kenneth, what's your plan? 
Well, I like to start cleaning in one corner, and then work my way across the room in a zig-zag. 
No, no, no. Your life plan. 
You're learning nothing here. 
You're doing nothing here. 
You're a punching bag. 
I like this job. 
Kenneth, this is not a job. 
This is an exercise in constant humiliation. 
You're fired. 
I beg your pardon? 
You said I'm your boss for today. 
So I fire you. 
How ya doin'? 
Liz! 
Hi. 
This is Kiara, Francesca, that's Talbot and that's Armand. 
Hello. 
Would you like something to drink? 
 Yes, Pinot Grigio. 
 I'll be right back. 
Is  that bad? 
So... 
you guys been watching Heroes? 
I like the Japanese dude. 
The hors d'oeuvres tonight are boxes of pure oxygen infused with a saffron and a white truffle oil. 
Wow. 
Hey, how is it going? 
Terrifying. 
It's too much. 
I just want to go home and watch that show about midgets and eat a block of cheddar cheese. 
If it makes you feel any better, I've discovered I'm not a Head. 
I'll talk to you later. 
Let's put the fun in funky. 
Hey! 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Sorry, that party was just a little too awesome for me. 
Do you want to go someplace else, just the two of us? 
Okay, what's your game, friend? 
Game? There's no game. 
What are you talking about? 
I don't have any money, if that's what you're after. 
And I'm not one of those girls that does weird stuff in bed, because they think they have to. 
If you're a gay guy looking for a beard, I don't do that anymore. 
And if you're trying to harvest my organs and sell them, I have an uncle who's a cop, so don't even try it. 
Hey, we all have uncles who are cops, so just take it down a notch. 
No hundreds. Small bills. 
Oh, I knew this was going to happen. 
Store policy. 
Yeah, that's an illegal policy. 
You have to take this. 
No, I don't. 
Yeah, sir. You do. 
See? It says right here: 
"Legal tender for all debts public and private." 
Does it say anything about $100 for a bottle of water? 
You can't decide what money you'll accept. 
 That's illegal. 
 It's an illegal policy. 
You're holding up the line.  
No, you're holding up the line. 
1998. 
Well, I spent most of the summer in the studio doing my Christmas album, which was huge. 
I'm almost afraid to ask. 
What Christmas album? 
* Imagine Christmas wishes * Shooting out of your eyes * A candy cake * Full of snow dreams *  A stocking full of smiles * It's a Jordan Christmas * I remember that. 
That video was raunchy. 
Mm-hmm. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
 Did you get home okay last night? 
 Yeah. 
Thank you for convincing me to go back to the party. 
It was fun. 
Although I ate way too much oxygen. 
Yeah, you actually got a little oxygen right there on your... coat. 
Thank you. 
This is going to sound pathetic, but I'm kind of trying to make myself do new things, and last night was all new for me, so that's good. 
Okay, so here's something else I bet you've never done before. 
Call in sick to work and go see a movie. 
A movie? 
A movie. 
 With you. 
 With me. 
 Now. 
 Right now. 
Come on. 
Good. 
Oh, Pete, it's me. 
I'm not coming in. 
I have a flu thing, and I'm I just barfed on 6th Avenue. 
Hi, Jack. 
I was, uh This is Gray. 
Nice to meet you. 
Lemon, you're looking a little under the weather. 
Maybe you should go home. 
Come on. 
Kenneth, do you have a minute? 
I sure don't. 
Kenneth, you and I actually have a lot in common. 
We're both hard workers. 
When I was your age, I was putting myself through college in Boston, paddling swan boats for the tourists. 
Is that a euphemism for some kind of sex worker? 
Kenneth, my point is, I worked hard, because I wanted to get somewhere. 
I had drive. 
And it disappoints me to see you without a dream, content with this meaningless, pitiful job. 
Do you know why I put up with this pitiful job, Mr. Donaghy? 
Why I fetch these folks' lunches and clean up their barfs? 
Because they make television. 
And more than jazz, or musical theater, or morbid obesity, television is the true American art form. 
Think of all the shared experiences television has provided for us. 
From the moon landing to the Golden Girls finale. 
From Walter Cronkite denouncing Vietnam to Oprah pulling that trash bag of fat out in a wagon. 
From the glory and the pageantry of the Summer Olympics to the less fun Winter Olympics. 
So please, don't tell me I don't have a dream, sir. 
I am living my dream. 
Oh, my. 
How did he get that up there? 
I wish I shared your passion for television, Kenneth. 
Which show would you rather watch? 
An ex-porn star who talks to ghosts, or a remake of Little House on the Prairie? 
Neither. 
I want to see a show where women get their hair done, while listening to salsa music. 
I also have an idea for a cop show. 
Called K-9, exclamation point. 
Oh, and a game show called Gold Case. 
It's a cross between Deal or No Deal and Millionaire, with a charming celebrity host to be determined. 
Go on. 
It's called Gold Case. 
It's Deal or No Deal meets Millionaire. 
There are ten models, each holding an identical briefcase, but one of them is filled with gold. 
Have you pitched this idea to anybody else? 
Well, I talked to Moonvest over at CBS. 
Les Moonves, president of CBS, knows about this? 
Hey, Moonvest, I got an idea for a game show last night. 
Give me your fingernails! 
No! 
We've got to move fast. 
Mr. Parcell, we love Gold Case. 
How do we make... 
your show? 
I thought y'all would know where to get cameras and stuff. 
I think he means, "How much do you want for it?" 
Oh. 
As far as compensation goes, I would like to be officially the head of the pages, and I need a new clock radio. 
You've got it up there, now snap it off. 
Also I want five points on the back end, 20% gross on merchandizing, and a creator credit on this and any international editions. 
And a clock radio. 
We're a go. 
Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
Woke up in the camper at the auto show, and that's how 2006 ended. 
2007? 
I can't believe this. 
We're actually going to pull this off. 
It was early January 2007 when I got the idea to write my autobiography. 
So I took a meeting at Random House, and I went in and talked to this editor about it, and this dude looked me straight in the eyes and said, "No, Mr. Jordan. No, thank you. 
We do not want your book." 
Oops, my bad. 
That's on me. 
Shut it down. 
No way. 
Your elevator opens right into your apartment? 
Are you coming in? 
I don't know. 
This is new for me. 
I don't really hang out with superfluously handsome gentlemen in kick-ass elevator lofts. 
What else don't you do? 
I don't smoke. 
I don't use any drugs, except for my allergy medicine. 
I don't download music without paying for it. 
And I never wear flip-flops. Ever. 
It's gross. 
Real? It's real. 
I do not sit on laps. 
Really? 
No, not a lap-sitter. 
Never have been. 
Nice to see you again. 
I thought you were trying new things. 
Okay.  
It's just-- It's a small girl thing, it's not a grown lady thing. 
Okay. 
All right, there you go. 
Okay? 
Mm-hmm. 
See? It's not so bad. 
No, it's not bad. 
I  can't I keep waiting for something to go wrong. 
Liz, I am not gay, I am not married, I don't have a human head in my freezer. 
Yeah, but you're the Hair. 
And so are you. 
Okay, we're going to do this, then. 
Mm-hmm. 
Why do you have a picture of my great-aunt Dolly? 
Uh, no, that's my grandmother's cousin Dolly. 
Dolly Harlan. 
No, I said Dolly... 
... Harlan. 
From Smithtown. 
Oh, my God. 
We're related. 
Oh, no. Oh, God. 
Wow. 
This is the worst! 
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were fifth cousins. 
Okay, on the count of three, say what level of cousins we would have to be for this to be okay. 
One, two, three. 
 Fifth. 
 Unacceptable, no matter what. 
This is never going to work. 
Of course it's not. 
It never was. 
This is what I get for trying to be somebody I am not. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Look, look. 
I meant what I said earlier. 
You are a Hair, Liz Lemon. 
It's in our blood. 
Accept it. 
Embrace it. 
I think we're third cousins. 
Yeah, I'll see you at the reunion. 
Kind of wish you had a door right now. 
All right, Jeff. 
One of these briefcases is filled with a million dollars' worth of solid gold. 
Are you ready? 
Let's play Gold Case! 
That one. 
Congratulations. 
You struck gold on Gold Case. 
 Uhoh. 
 What? 
That one. 
That one. 
That one. 
Congratulations. 
You struck gold on Gold Case. 
Oh, gold's real heavy, isn't it? 
This game doesn't work. 
Okay, my bad. 
Shut it down. 
Shut it down! 
That's it! 
At least you got a clock radio out of it, right? 
Whose idea was this? 
This is pathetic. 
A joke. 
This whole show is a joke. 
Hey, what's wrong with you? 
What? 
Your face it's like you're happy or something. 
I am happy, Frank. 
'Cause of that dude you're donking. 
Floyd? 
Yes. 
He just gets me. 
I think you've got a little something Right here? 
Other side. 
Here? 
Up a little. 
In that area? 
You got it. 
Ugh, that movie was a complete waste of time. 
I thought it was moving... 
my bowel Heh heh. 
Mmm... 
Oh... 
Reverse, reverse, skip, skip, draw four! 
Oh, hell no! 
Ha ha! 
That's awesome, Liz. 
I'm really happy that you found someone to care about. 
Because relationships are hard. 
So if you ever need someone to come over and videotape you guys doing it, or whatever, I can make room in my schedule. 
Thanks, Frank. 
You're welcome. 
No judgments. 
Don. 
Jack, you old dog, how are you? 
I'm good, sir. 
Of course you are. 
Look at those eyes, sharp, like a panther's. 
Thank you, sir would you like to sit down? 
I can't. 
I took my grandkids snorkeling at St. Bart's, 
and got stung by a jellyfish. 
I got a welt on my ass the size of a Red Delicious apple. 
I'm very sorry to hear that, sir. 
Yeah. 
Boy, Jack... 
you really terrified the people with that fireworks special of yours. 
Well, we were trying for something dramatic, and I don't regret trying. 
Well, you gotta try. 
As my old man always said, If you try, you win. 
And he was a hell of a garbage man. 
I just want you to know we all still have a lot of faith in you, Jack. 
Well, thank you, sir. 
That means the world coming from you. 
But I'm taking the microwave division away from you. 
I mean, you're in the rough, Jack. 
You gotta get back on the fairway. 
Yes, sir. 
You ever think about getting remarried? 
Well, I just got divorced, sir. 
Everyone in this division is married except you. 
Look at Bob. 
His wife looks just like Walter Matthau, but she's always there for him. 
That's the kind of companion you need. 
Think about that. 
I will, sir. 
I'm going to see Tracy Jordan. 
He is funny. 
What's that film where he turned into a dog? 
Uh,Fat Bitch,sir. 
That's it I love it. 
Boy, that's a great film. 
I'm sorry I let you down. 
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Don Geiss. 
Would you like some Grenadine or some fried rice? 
I'm good, thanks. 
Sir, I have a movie project that is going to blow your mind. 
I call itJefferson. 
A movie version ofThe Jeffersons? 
I love it. 
No, Thomas Jefferson. 
I just recently found out that he went to town on one of my ancestors, so we're related. 
You want to play Thomas Jefferson? 
And Sally Hemings, and King George. 
I'm going to play all the parts. 
Did you know he had a lisp? 
Whath's up, sthupid jerks? 
I'm Thomas Jefferthon. 
So we're gonna need about 35 million to do this thing right. 
I'm gonna get us one of those big clocks. 
We could hang it in there. 
Sorry I'm late. 
Aw, Lutz, that's okay. 
I'm just glad you're here. 
Oh, you've got a face like a baby's bottom! 
Boop. 
I hate when you're in a good mood. 
It makes me feel unsafe. 
Like when my mom used to make daiquiris and sing Tanya Tucker songs. 
That sounds awesome. 
Miss Lemon, Mr. Donaghy 
would like to see you. 
He's across the street at Christie's auction house. 
Oh, brother. 
What's this? 
Jack goes to Sbarro when he's angry, the New York Stock Exchange when he's horny, and Christie's auction house when he's depressed. 
He said he needs you immediately. 
Yeah... 
that's the Liz face I'm comfortable with. 
You've been avoiding me, Lemon. 
How do you do that without turning around? 
To be perfectly honest, the first couple of people I did that to were not you. 
But...here we are. 
Mr. Donaghy. 
, you probably don't remember me. 
I'm Phoebe. 
I handled the sale of your ex-wife's jewelry to an anonymous Arab. 
Oh, yes, of course. 
Those were such lovely pieces. 
(Phoebe) The ruby and diamond cluster ring was particularly exquisite. 
That was her engagement ring. 
You know, I took the money from the sale of those pces, and I bought a sailboat, and I named it after my ex-wife, and I sank it. 
It's true. 
TheBianca Blows is somewhere at the bottom of the Peconic Bay. 
If there's anything I can show you, please do let me know. 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
I really do like these equestrian paintings. 
Isn't that magnificent? 
Sometimes I wish I were a horse. 
Strong, free. 
My chestnut haunches glistening in the sun. 
Are you okay? 
Hmm? 
Oh, yeah, sure. 
You know, I'm really sorry that I let you down. 
You should be. 
My special was a disaster. 
I wouldn't say that. 
You left me dangling, Lemon. 
I'm not a creative type like you, with your work sneakers and your left-handedness. 
I can't do what you do. 
I know, I dropped the ball. 
I was just trying to do what you said, and have a personal life. 
And I guess I got caught up with this new guy. 
Oh, right, flower guy. 
His name is Floyd. 
That's unfortunate. 
I'd really like you to meet him, Jack. 
Fine. 
I'd like to meet the man that made Liz Lemon shirk her responsibilities. 
Let's say Persil, 9:00. 
Be sure to wear a tie. 
Are you sure you're okay? 
I pitched my Jefferson movie to Don Geiss. 
He said no. 
He said people only see movies because of the previews, and he couldn't visualize my Jefferson preview. 
He wants me to do Fat Bitch 2instead. 
Well, that doesn't even make sense. 
Everyone knows Fat Bitch died at the end. 
It's not the kind of stuff I want to do anymore, Ken. 
I want to be taken seriously. 
What should I do? 
Well, remember when Fat Bitch called all her dog friends together, and they used their high-pitched howling to mess up the You're right, K. 
I should make my own Jefferson preview, and show it to Don Geiss. 
I'm never gonna finish this bikini before Nana's birthday. 
Hey, Liz Lemon, where you going? 
Uh, home. 
I gotta go get ready for a dinner with Jack. 
Listen, I'm gonna need to make a fake trailer for my Jefferson film. 
I'm gonna need the entire resources of the show for no more than three weeks. 
You in? 
No-wha No. 
Tracy, you're not doing that. 
We have a show on Friday. 
Liz Lemon, you are my Alexander Hamilton. 
I don't know what that means. 
Writers, listen. 
I need your help. 
Well, I hope this isn't too boring for you. 
Are you kidding? 
Jack Donaghy's a legend. 
I've read his book, like, 20 times. 
Jack wrote a book? 
Yeah. 
Jack Attack: The Art of Aggression in Business. 
Oh, no. 
(Floyd) He got here before us. 
You're not supposed to let that happen. 
That's chapter two in the book. 
Hi, Jack. 
This is Floyd. 
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
Well, you're Floyd. 
The only other Floyd I ever knew was this Korean barber who used to cut my hair down in the 50th Street subway station. 
That's my dad. 
I'm Floyd, Jr. 
I-I'm just kidding. 
Well, please. 
Sorry. 
I'm just nervous to meet the head of east coast television and microwave oven programming. 
I just got the word from Geiss they're taking me off microwave. 
Oh, no. 
Really? 
Mr. Donaghy, 
with all due respect to Mr. Geiss, 
I gotta say he's making a terrible mistake. 
This company's stability in the small-appliance market is in large part your doing. 
The dedicated popcorn setting on your microwave was the imagination breakthrough of 1995. 
In 2002, you increased corporate earnings by 3%, while the country suffered through a recession. 
AndAttack of the Clones, which was seriously the worst of theStar Wars One sec, Liz, one sec. 
And on a personal note, sir, in my mind, the Foo Fighters' song Best of You is about your managerial skills. 
Lemon, I want to kiss your boyfriend on the mouth. 
Chapter 12. 
I thought you were gonna do it. 
What are you drinking? 
Club soda. 
Oh, that's a shame. 
Pete! 
Hey, Liz Lemon. 
Could you go away for a while? 
I gotta get rid of Freddie's erection. 
Explain what is happening here. 
Freddie is playing the part of Thomas Jefferson's horse Caractacus. 
We needed a place to keep him till we shoot his stunts. 
No, acy, I told you not to do this. 
Jack said I could. 
This movie is my destiny. 
It's the reason why God put me on this earth. 
I'll take you off this earth. 
(Phoebe) The overwhelming violence of the subject matter is in deliberate juxtaposition with the pastoral beauty of the terrain. 
Jack, Tracy put a horse in my office. 
Lemon, you've met Hello. 
You probably don't remember me--I'm Phoebe. 
We met the other day. 
Yeah, yeah, I remember you. 
I'm Liz. 
Oh, sorry. 
I don't shake hands. 
I have Avian Bone Syndrome. 
Oh, boy, okay. 
Hollow bones. 
Lemon, I want your opinion. 
Which ofthese two do you like? 
They're both beautiful. 
They look just like the one crapping in my office. 
Did you tell Tracy he could use the crew to make a trailer for his crazy movie? 
Yes. 
How's Floyd? 
What? he's fine. 
You know, I called him earlier. 
We had a very nice chat did he mention that? 
No, he didn't. 
Oh, he will. 
He's a good man, the Floydster. 
Oh, "the Floydster." 
Don't give him a nickname before I do. 
Um...the white horse. 
I was wondering if Did I hurt you? 
Just a little bit, but that's okay. 
(Phoebe) Yes, the white horse, it's Yo, Trey, we got a problem. 
Pray, who be this Tracy Jordan thou speakest of? 
Uh, President Jefferson, we got a problem. 
Speakest. 
That horse ate your wig. 
Well, stand guard by his rump, and await it in his droppings. 
Or we could probably just go get a new wig. 
I like you, young man. 
You shall run my university. 
Yeah, yeah. 
No, it's very nice. 
Hey, what are you doing here, Jack? 
Jack bought me this painting. 
Wow. Um... 
Is that lion eating the horse? 
Or perhaps it's eating universal health care. 
I bought this for the Floydster to congratulate him on his promotion. 
Well, it's not a sure thing. 
I didn't know you were up for a promotion. 
Well We should go celebrate. 
I'm free for lunch. 
Do you want to grab a burger, or Shoot, I just said I'd go to lunch with Jack. 
Oh. 
Why don't you join us? 
Would that be okay? 
Yeah, I guess so. 
Sure. 
It's kind of like you two are dating. 
Um, I think that Coulter was right about Edwards. 
So where's Pete? 
He took his kids to that Russian cat circus. 
Wow. 
You are bringin' it. 
Yeah, you like that? 
Mmm. 
It's got pockets are you into that? 
Ooh, what's this? 
A used Kleenex. 
I feel like I'm in a rap video. 
Wait, let me turn on my humidifier. 
Yeah. 
Uh-oh. 
It's so dry in here. 
I really don't know how much more of this I can take. 
Unh, unh... 
Unh, unh. 
Yeah. 
Old school, Kid 'n Play. 
Here we go. 
That's not that impressive. 
That's Davy Jones. 
Hey, it's Jack. 
Jack what does he want? 
He's just saying hi. 
Oh, he wants to meet at that diner on 71st. 
Get a veggie burger and a milkshake. 
You wanna go? 
It's midnight. 
Yeah, we don't have to go. 
There, done. 
Good, 'cause this VapoRub isn't gonna get under my nose by itself. 
He says goodnight. 
And "sleep tight." 
"And don't let the bed--" All right, enough. 
Gimme that. 
"Jack, I have taken a sleeping pill "because I have a big lawyer meeting..." 
That's what we call 'em. 
"in the morning. 
Floyd." 
"Lemon, is that you?" 
I always sign it Floydster. 
It's Jack! 
Don't answer it. 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God!  
Can he see us? 
The call is coming from inside the house! 
Turn of the lights and get down. 
Jonathan, I want to talk to Jack right now. 
He's at Christie's. 
But he left these for you. 
What's this? 
Tickets for you and Floyd for tonight's Knicks game. 
For me and Floyd? 
He tried to drop them off at your house last night, but someone pretended not to be home. 
Oh. 
This is really nice. 
Yes, he seems very taken with Floyd. 
And you, of course. 
Are these good seats? 
Yeah. 
It's actually a private box. 
in background] Hey, guys. 
Mr. Geiss, I know we disagreed 
on my next movie project, but I hope this will change your mind. 
I give you this. 
(Tracy) Ah... 
hoe that dirt. 
Put your back into it. 
Mr. Jefferson, 
the British have invaded. 
Ah, bring me my horse! 
Bring me Caractacus! 
You come along. 
(announcer) In a world without hope... 
Who are these Americans with their ridiculous ideas of freedom and equalities? 
(announcer) One man would declare his independence for us all. 
Aah! 
Eat that, King George! 
I shall call it Susan! 
I'm with child. 
What? 
Free me and make me your wife. 
Um, I'll have to get back to you on that. 
(announcer) Source Award nominee Tracy Jordan... 
Kill them! 
Kill them all! 
(announcer) NAACP Image Award presenter Tracy Jordan... 
and Academy Award watcher Tracy Jordan is... 
This is for you, Don Geiss! 
Ha ha! 
(announcer) Jefferson! 
Christmas, 2008. 
Get me off this horse. 
Well, Mr. Geiss, 
what do you think? 
Well, Tracy... 
that was terrible. 
The answer is no. 
Let's talk about Fat Bitch 2. 
So I'm bored, and I sit next to Don Geiss, and I want to make a good impression, so I bought four bottles of absolutely fantastic champagne. 
Lemon, you're gonna love this story. 
You told me this story, Jack. 
We're on our way to Tokyo, (Liz and Jack) we're out over the ocean, and the cabin pressure drops. 
The masks are coming out of the ceiling, and the corks are popping out of the champagne. 
And I don't give a damn about the masks, I'm on all fours trying to shove the corks back in the bottle. 
And Don Geiss says, "Now, there's an executive who knows how to keep his costs down!" 
That's great. 
I'm gonna get some more crab cakes. 
Liz, you want anything? 
No, thanks. 
What are you doing?! 
I'm watching the ballgame with you and the Floydster. 
But don't you kind of feel like a third wheel, Jack? 
No, Lemon you'rethe third wheel. 
Excuse me? 
Well, it's really quite simple. 
Men seek out the company of other men they admire and want to be like. 
Floyd is me 20 years ago. 
I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago. 
20 years from now, Floyd will be me, I'm gonna be Don Geiss, and Don Geiss will be dead. 
Who thinks like that? 
Men do. 
That's why you're the third wheel. 
Just back off, okay? 
Lemon, are you telling me to stay away from your boyfriend? 
Not that I blame you, because I could take him away from you if I wanted to. 
This is my life, Jack. 
I know you're in a bad spot right now. 
But you can't use Floyd to feel better about yourself. 
It's not fair. 
All right, how about some kind of a time-share arrangement? 
You can have him Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't want Friday we have a show. 
Why am I even having this conversation with you?! 
Look at your life, Jack. 
It's like this skybox. 
It's fancy and it's empty, and it smells like crab cakes. 
Get your own Floyd, because this one is taken. 
Oh, outstanding. 
Thank you. 
Sure. 
Sir? 
He said no. 
Then he offered me $7 million to reprise my role as Cocoa the dog. 
? I'm gonna get 
an iPhone ? 
? Everybody's gonna 
be jealous ? 
No, I turned him down. 
It's like a roller-coaster ride of emotion in here. 
Look, Thomas Jefferson made his own country. 
I'm gonna make my own movie. 
Finance it myself, all on my terms. 
Now, who's with me? 
We all are, sir. 
Good, good, good. 
Now, first order of business, get that dead horse out of my car. 
Well, I'm sorry your friend wasn't pleased with the Stubbs. 
Yes, so am I. 
You seem very preoccupied. 
Well, it's just... 
people don't like fireworks anymore. 
Were you aware of that? 
They took away the microwave division. 
I'm having terrible Lemon problems. 
I'm eating all the time. 
I mean, who needs 16 flautas after midnight? 
Mr. Donaghy... 
Jack. 
Listen, if you're still interested, there is another piece I'd like to show you that you might enjoy. 
I'll need to take you back to the private office. 
This piece is very delicate. 
Very few people have handled it. 
Oh, God, I hope we're talking about the same thing. 
May I speak with you? 
If this is about the other night, I am not gonna apologize. 
This whole Floyd thing No, no, no. 
You're absolutely right. 
I have to make some changes in my life, just like you have. 
Phoebe and I are seeing each other. 
Really? 
Wow, that's great. 
Now you have a Floydster, and I have a Floydster. 
Well, I don't think Phoebe would appreciate being referred to as a Floydster. 
But you like her? 
You approve? 
Of what? 
Of her for me. 
Yeah, sure. 
Good. 
Hello, I'm Phoebe. 
I don't know if you remember me, but Yes, Phoebe, I remember you. 
Hi. 
May I ask you something? 
Uh, Phoebe, I want you to be my wife. 
Wait, what? 
Will you marry me? 
No! 
The ruby diamond cluster! 
I bought it back from the anonymous Arab. 
How romantic. 
Ow. 
Ow. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay. 
Ow. 
Oh, boy. 
(Phoebe) Careful, my bones. 
Subs By Traff and raceman Okay, Round 2. 
Josh, you're up. 
What do you got? 
Check it out. 
Your mama is so stupid, she thinks an iMac is a new hamburger at McDonald's. 
Okay, not bad. 
Okay, okay, I got one. I got one. 
What's the difference between your mama and a washing machine? 
When I drop a load in the washing machine it doesn't follow me around for a week. 
Lemon, could I speak with you alone for a moment? 
That's what your sister asked me last night. Booyah! 
Uh, right this way. 
Uh, my friend Gerhard Hapsburg is throwing a birthday party for himself at the Pierre tonight. 
Oh, and you want me to think of something funny that you can write in the card? 
No. I want you to come with me. 
Oh. 
Who's Gerhard Hapsburg? 
Prince Gerhard is the last male descendant of the Imperial House of Hapsburg. 
They ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
The Defenestration of Prague? 
Lemon, what exactly did you study in college? 
 Theatre Tech. 
 I see. 
I'm inviting you to the social event of the season. 
Oh...I don't know, Jack. 
Would I have to wear high heel shoes? 
Yes. This will be good for you. 
You finally got Dennis out of your life. 
You're even wearing lipstick. 
No. They're just really chapped. 
I'll have the wardrobe department pull a dress for you. 
I just thought maybe you'd like to spend some time with a, um... 
different class of people. 
Okay, fine. I'll do it. 
But I'm not gonna like it. 
That's what your mom said to me last night. 
Booyah. 
You got slammed, girl. 
That was surprising. 
Yes, dear. 
Oh, boy, who's crying? 
Is that Caleb? 
What's up, Pete? 
Okay, I'll try. Yeah. 
Elmo wants you to aim your pee-pee at the potty! 
Ha ha! No, not at Mommy. 
At the potty. 
How is that Elmo's fault? 
Did Mommy have some wine before she called Elmo? 
Click. Enhhhh! 
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete. 
 Where's your spinal cord, son? 
 What? 
No, it's just my wife is visiting her folks and she's a little stressed out. 
Yeah, seem like you got yourself a Delilah. 
A what? 
Pete, you got two type of women in this world: one who gives you strength and one who takes strength from you like Delilah took strength from Samson in that movie? 
My wife gives me strength, make me feel like a man. 
That's why she's so special. 
I actually haven't met your wife yet. Hi. 
That ain't my wife. 
Go get me a fizzy water. 
It's like this, Pete. 
I love my wife. I love her. 
We're a team. 
That's why eight times a week I go to the strip club. 
It gives me energy, which I bring back to her. 
And your wife doesn't get jealous? 
Nah. She likes it. 
Makes me feel strong, like a Samson. 
Here. 
 Samson! 
 What? 
Great shoving, Mr. Jordan. 
Wow, what's that for? 
Well, I'm going to a birthday party for some prince tonight. 
You mean like a dog birthday party? 
Oh, that's better. 
No. He's a real European prince: 
Gerhard Hapsburg. 
What? You have to take me with you. 
Oh, Liz, it's always been my dream to meet and marry a prince, like a modern day Cinderella story. 
Hey, maybe I'm Cinderella this time. 
No, Liz, Cinderella is blonde. 
You can be Snow White and party with the little people. 
Oh, take me. 
I can't take you. 
I'm only getting in because Donaghy's taking me. 
Wait. You're gonna be 
Jack Donaghy's date? 
No. It's not a date. 
Wow. Lemon. 
I, uh, got you a little something. 
Oh, my--Ow! 
That really hurt my hand. 
Dag! Who does that?! 
I'm sorry. 
Our car will be downstairs at 7:00. 
Could you make sure that she, uh, gets this? 
Oh, yes. 
Sorry. 
This is definitely a date. 
No. 
Is it? 
I didn't know I was coming to this tonight. 
Don't apologize. 
You look great. 
May I? 
Uh, I got it. Thanks. 
Careful. 
Careful. 
Thank you so much. 
Let's see, um... 
to us. 
Is this a date? 
What?  
Lemon... 
I date socialites and models and actresses-- Liz Hurley in the '90s. 
Fine. My mistake. 
I think 's so funny that you thought that. 
Hi, Jack. Maybe I'll see you later. 
I hope so. Her. 
Her. 
Her. 
The two of them. 
This guy coming up on my left his daughter this summer. 
Wes, good to see you. 
Pete Hornberger, tonight is the night we celebrate our bodies and our minds. 
Hit it! 
Oh, hello. 
Hi. How did you get in here? 
Oh, Liz, if you dress well and enter with confidence, you can get in anywhere. 
You showed the security guy your boobs, didn't you? 
Just one. 
It's not the White House. 
Um, Chocatini, please? 
You were dead wrong about this being a date, by the way. 
I just made a complete ass out of myself in front of Jack. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
When I'm the Queen of Australia, I'll have him executed. 
Austria. 
Yeah, that's what I said. 
Ladies und gentlemen, may I present His Royal Highness, zeh Duke of Thuringia, Earl of the Duchy of Westphalia, Prince Gerhard Messerschmidt Ramstein Von Hap. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, all dear friends for coming to my birthday! 
Wow, who's Snow White now? 
7:45, and I'm still awake. 
 That Gerhard is amazing, isn't he? 
 Ahhum. 
Most people in his situation would be angry with their family for the centuries of inbreeding, but not Gerhar. 
He's too busy trying to stave off infection. 
Oh, my God. 
What is she doing here? 
Who? 
My ex-wife. 
Oh, I forgot, you were married. 
Wow, she's gorgeous. 
And surprisingly age-appropriate. 
Damn it. I was told she was in Paris. 
The party of the year, that woman turns up, and I'm all alone. 
Thanks. 
Johnny. 
Bianca. 
Ah, it's been a while. 
You look good. 
Thank you. 
Do you remember my fianc� Vincent Foley? 
Yes, of course. 
This is my live-in girlfriend Lemon. 
Elizabeth. 
Elizabeth. 
Hello, Elizabeth. 
Lemon. 
Nice to meet you. 
And how did you two meet? 
It was part of the Big Brother/ Little Sister Program. 
Congratulations, John. 
She's much sharper than the last girl you had. 
What was her name? 
Beyonc�. 
And unlike the rest of Jack's girlfriends, I have all my original parts. 
Oh, hang on to this one, John. 
She's a keeper. 
Mmm, yeah. I'm a keeper. 
So now it's a date? 
I thought I could never be your date, Jack. 
I thought no one would ever believe it because I'm so grotesque. 
Thank you for not embarrassing me. 
Excuse me, Miss, but His Highness has noticed you. 
Who, Gerhard? 
Really? 
His Highness is quite taken und invites you to dine next to him. 
Oh, wow. That's... 
flattering. 
Are you sure that me meant me? 
His Highness is attempting to wink at you. 
Oh. Heh. 
There you are. 
I need your help. 
I've been asked to dine with His Majesty. 
Oh, well, if you're looking to sneak out the window, it doesn't open. 
I already tried it. 
Should I say I'm still a virgin? 
Wait. You're actually considering this? 
Of course I'm considering it. 
You know I've always reminded myself of Grace Kelly. 
I'm not gonna be gorgeous forever. 
Who knows how long this show will last, and I have no other skills whatsoever. 
I need to find someone who can take care of me. 
Yeah. I don't think Gerhard 
can take care of you. 
And I can get past someone's looks. 
Since when? 
I'm an actress, Liz. 
It would be my greatest role of all time. 
You've already made up your mind about this, haven't you? 
Oh, you're right, Liz, I should go for it. 
You're not even listening, are you? 
Poop. Monkey Butt. 
No. You're a good friend. 
And thank you. 
You enjoying yourself, Pete? 
Actually Actually, Tracy, I'm trying to get some work done here. 
Hey, Supersize, take care of that dude. 
That there's my friend. 
Saved my life when we was in Desert Storm. 
Our tank broke down. 
He killed 14 Germans so we could get the hell outta there. 
No. No, actually, 
I'm just a producer on Tracy's show. 
You're a producer? 
Yeah. 
I'm an actress. 
Oh, yeah? 
Have you ever seen the movie... 
Secret Touchings? 
I was a scientist in that. 
No, I'm not familiar with that. 
Your name sounds Jewish. 
You must be important. 
No. 
Well, I just, you know, I run the show. 
Mr. Hornberger. 
This is shocking. 
Mind your business, son! 
He's embracing his power. 
Rawwrr. 
Rawwrr. Rawwrr. 
Hey, are you gonna come sit down? 
Because they put out lobster tails, and I want to eat yours. 
Isn't she beautiful? 
Yeah. What happened there? 
I just couldn't keep up with her. 
On any level. 
Socially, it was a different party, a different charity event every night. 
I had to keep my tuxedo in my glove compartment. 
Sexually she wanted it four or five times a day. 
And always standing up. 
Standing up, what? 
How does that even work? 
You're kidding, right? 
Yeah. 
She left me, Lemon, 'cause I was never enough for her. 
So now I keep it simple: nothing but endless, meaningless one-night stands with a carousel of super hot women I couldn't care less about. 
That's heartbreaking. 
And her? 
She just keeps getting better. 
She's lost weight. 
She cut her hair. 
Look at her over there, taunting me. 
Seeing her so happy and normal makes me crazy. 
You've got to move on, maybe. 
Is she coming over here? 
She's coming over here. 
If she comes over here, I'm gonna do something. 
Okay, come on. 
Let's go. Let's go dance. 
 Oh, no, no, no. No. 
 Yeah, come on. 
It's a fast song. 
Okay, easy there, Jackie Chan. 
 Are they in? They're not out? 
 Yeah, be careful. 
Oh. Hee hee. 
That tickles. 
Oh, my dear Jenna... 
you are exquisite! 
Uh, Gerhard... 
would you like to dance? 
Sadly, because my body does not produce joint fluid, I cannot. 
But I would enjoy watching you dance for me. 
Oh... 
all right. 
Jazz! 
Tap! 
Jitterbug! 
Charleston! 
Ooh. 
Interpretive! 
Twirl! 
Twirl again! 
Keep twirling! 
Everyone thinks I'm 5'5", but I'm only 5'4". 
Wow! That is an amazing story. 
Yeah. 
What are you doing? 
You are a married man. 
I'm not doing anything wrong. 
Just--I'm just dancing, Kenneth. 
Do you remember the movie, Footloose, where those evil kids won in the end? 
You're going to make a mistake tonight. 
You gonna make a mistake tonight! 
Remember the vows you and your wife took in that church. 
Botanical garden. 
Botanical garden. 
You promised fidelity Lick her face. 
Think of God. 
Look, both of you calm down. 
I'm just trying to have some fun for the first time in, like, ten years. 
Ladies und gentlemen, if you will please direct your attention to zeh center of zeh room, it is now time for zeh cake. 
(attendees) Aw. 
You're 25? 
Yes. Can you believe it? 
Finally old enough to rent a car. 
Ahck! 
Ahck! 
Oh, it feels good to laugh. 
Oh, boy! 
* Happy birthd-- * Zum geburstag viel gluck * * Zum geburstag viel gluck * * Zum getburstag viel * * Gerhard * Gerhard * Zum geburstag viel gluck * Go on. 
Pbbbbbt! 
Pbbbbbt! 
Sie sprechen Deutsch? 
Yes. Yay. 
Is that Jenna mit Gerhard? 
Bianca. 
Happy birthday. 
Thank you. 
Vicky. 
No. This is the men's room. 
I know. I just wanted to talk to you. 
Oh, no, no. 
You don't need to do that. 
We should get back to the party, right? 
I mean, shouldn't we? 
 Mr. Hornberger. 
 I mean, right? 
 The party? 
 Mr. Hornberger! 
Never done it in a men's bathroom before. 
Well, in this building. 
Wow. 
You're... 
Smooth. 
Mr. Hornberger! 
Kenneth? 
You're making the biggest mistake of your life. 
Don't do it. 
Oh, I suppose you're gonna tell me I should do it. 
No. I'm just lookin' for the lobby. 
But, yes, you should do it. 
(Ken) No, you shouldn't. 
Please think of your children. 
Be a Samson! 
You're a better man than this. 
She's so smooth. 
I'm sorry. 
I can't do this. 
I love my wife. 
My wife is not a Delilah, Tracy. 
Hey, that's beautiful. 
I feel you, Hornberger. 
Who's that tickling my feet? 
I'm gonna kick you in your face, I know that. 
Just water, please. 
Are you going to marry him? 
Oh, hi. What? 
Are you going to marry Jack? 
Uh...I don't know. 
We've talked about it. 
I can tell from the way he looks at you that he's serious. 
That's going to get you pregnant right away, I'm sure. 
A little late-in-life baby he can parade around Nantucket. 
The whole thing makes me want to vomit. 
Oh, no. You know what 
I can take the models the Rockettes to Shakira because ultimately I know they are going to leave him, but you? 
You can actually make him happy. 
And that makes me want to sit on a knife! 
Wow. 
I hate seeing Johnny happy! 
Uh... 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, Jenna, this is almost like something out of a fairy tale. 
 Yes. 
Almost. 
Great news. Great news. 
Bianca is neither normal nor happy. 
You don't have to do this, Lemon. 
I'm telling you, she's not over you. 
And get this: she was all jealous of me. 
She busted out crying over it. 
That's impossible. 
Oh...fine. 
You don't believe me? 
I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna tell her that you just proposed to me, and you watch her. 
Watch how red her face gets, okay? 
Bianca, I have to tell you, Jack and I are engaged. 
Ah! 
Aah! 
Let go. Aah! 
You! 
What do you know? 
Jenna... 
I know we have just met, but I think I love you. 
Do you love me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
Oh! 
Knowing I have the love of a beautiful woman has set me free. 
I think you just lost an eyebrow. 
To freedom. 
To us. 
Thank you, dear Jenna. 
And good-bye. 
Good-bye? 
W-why good-bye? 
Who let him drink champagne? 
He cannot metabolize zeh grapes. 
Someone call Dr. Spuchemen! 
Uh-oh. 
I think she pulled out a chunk of my hair. 
Really? Where? 
Oh, yeah. 
We gotta boogie, gang. 
Meine damen und herren, zeh Hapsburg line... 
has ended. 
You can pick up your gift bags at zeh coat check. 
Hey, Pete, really inspiring what you did back there. 
You're strong now. 
When your wife get home, you gonna mess it up? 
Actually, I think I might. 
Let's go. 
You goin' down, Pete? 
Uh... I'll take the stairs. 
Hold the door, please. 
Mmm! You look like a baby. 
Well, thanks for a fun evening. 
Sorry your friend died. 
When Gerhard was born, the doctor told his mother and cousin he would either live for 15 minutes or for 100 years. 
Boy, he proved them all wrong. 
No, please, come in. 
The look on Bianca's face just before she choked you. 
 That was the most satisfying thing. 
 It was pretty good. 
Oh, just to know that she's filled with bile over me warms my heart. 
Attaboy. That's the Jack Donaghy I know. 
What are these, your bike shorts? 
All right, knock it off. 
Lemon, I want to thank you for showing me that I can have a pleasant evening with a woman my own age. 
I'm 12 years younger than you. 
A woman your age, then. 
Jack, wait. 
Oh, my God. I thought you were 
Oh, good lord, Lemon, let it go. 
That's never going to happen. 
I've been with beauty queens Yes, I get it. 
Pilates instructors, acrobats. 
 Get outta here so I can take my shoes off. 
 Come on. 
I had "lunch" with Martha Stewart and "dinner" with her daughter Alexis. 
Gross. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman You're my girl, right? 
And I take care of you, huh? 
Who knows? 
Maybe we'll see Natalie Morales, you know? 
That little firecracker, she gets my blood running south of the border. 
That is less sweet. 
I'm gonna stop by tonight. 
Maybe I'll pick up some Chinese. 
Aw, you said "Chinese" instead of something offensive. 
Yeah, I told you, losing you last year, changed me, huh? 
It made me more, um...more mature. 
Huh? Come here. 
Ow, that really hurts, Dennis. 
You're back with Dennis? 
Yeah, I'm back with Dennis. 
Don't look at me with your eyebrows all up. 
It's so annoying. 
Yes, I'm annoying, not the man who honked your boobs on the jumbo screen. 
That was before. 
And it was the playoffs. 
Does he still work at that beeper store? 
What is it, "Beeper King"? 
He is the King now. 
The old Beeper King retired... 
Well, technically he shot himself. 
But Dennis took over and now he's the only beeper salesman left in Manhattan, which is cool in a way. 
You're doing the eyebrow thing again. 
Because it's Dennis. 
Who are you trying to fool? 
 This is me. 
 Exactly. 
You don't get to give dating advice. 
You sent a letter to Scott Peterson. 
After he dyed his hair and got super thin from all the stress. 
Are you kidding me? 
He was smokin'. 
Dennis is a good guy, okay? 
Not really. 
So when did this happen? 
Well, last week was my birthday, and everyone forgot except Dennis. 
And he called, and we went out, and it wasn't too weird. 
And how is the sex? 
Fast and only on Saturdays. 
It's perfect. 
Did you see this? 
It's horrible. 
They're printing libel about me again. 
Libel, Liz Lemon! 
Oh..."Normal." 
How dare they? 
That's what I'm saying. 
That's character assassination. 
That's not normal! 
It only looks like I'm walking out of a Starbucks when, actually, I'm doing the robot goin' backwards into a Starbucks. 
And I don't even know whose dog that is. 
Yes, I steal dogs. 
What is the problem? 
I can't be normal! 
If I'm normal, I'm boring. 
If I'm boring, I'm not a movie star. 
If I'm not a movie star, then I'm poor. 
And poor people can't afford to pay back the $75,000 in cash they owe Quincy Jones! 
Wow...Talking to that guy, 
it's like looking in a mirror, huh? 
Well, my armpit rash is back. 
Oh, Jack. You're in wardrobe. 
The latest research is in. 
Our audience doesn't like green. 
Oh, that's too bad. 
I like green. 
Research doesn't lie, Jenna. 
It lets us know what we're thinking What's too boring, what's too gay, what's too old. 
What's too old? 
That's a very good question. 
How old are you? 
I'm 29. 
 What year were you born? 
 1977. 
 When did you graduate high school? 
 '94. 
 When do you turn 40? 
 2017. 
 Junior high crush? 
 Kirk Cameron. 
 Prom theme? 
 Motownphilly, Boyz II Men. 
 What movie did you lose your virginity at? 
 Arachnophobia. 
Theater or drive-in? 
What's a drive-in? 
Of course. 
I don't know why I bothered to ask. 
I can tell just from your physical appearance that you're obviously... 
29. 
...So these page numbers, 
when done correctly, should be sequential. 
Oh. Oh, Josh! 
Liz Taylor's assistant called. 
They wanted the address here to send you something. 
That's awesome. 
She must have seen my impression of her. 
Sounds like someone loves Liz Taylor. 
I do. 
No, we mean love love. 
Yeah, like if she walked in right now and said she wanted to do it with you, you would. 
I definitely would. 
What? 
Liz. 
(Josh) No, I'm totally serious. 
I mean, wouldn't you guys? 
Jack asked me how old I am. 
What did you say? 
29.   
Ahem. 
Jenna, relax. 
I cannot and will not relax, Liz. 
I am an actress. 
And when someone asks an actress how old she is, it's more statement than question. 
When my mom's feeling old, she goes to this guy on 71st Street. 
But she's old. 
She's like 38. 
I'm gonna be sick. 
* Betcha he reads, betcha she sews * * Betcha they've made me *  A closet * Of clothes * Lemon, what tragedy happened in your life that you insist upon punishing yourself with all this... 
mediocrity? 
What? 'Cause I'm eating a turkey sub? 
Your turkey sub, your clothes, the fact that a woman of your resources and position lives like some boxcar hobo. 
Or maybe it's the fact that while I'm saying all this, you have a piece of lettuce stuck in your hair. 
This is the unlisted number.. 
of Stone, the most exclusive restaurant in the city, currently. 
I think it's time that you start enjoying some of the finer things in life. 
Completely unsolicited and inappropriate. 
I will only accept it because I love food. 
Do you know why Jack Welch is the greatest leader since the pharaohs? 
Because he didn't only involve himself in our work lives, but our personal lives as well. 
He introduced us to the finest booze, the most restrictive country clubs. 
He gave us the names of the most discreet private investigators to spy on our ex-wives. 
He held our hands during our triumphs and our Senate hearings. 
I want to hold your hand, Lemon. 
Yikes. 
This is a perfect example. 
You have a million-dollar view, yet you refuse to acknowledge that there's a whole world out there. 
Oh, my. 
There appears to be a gentleman making passionate, angry, love to himself. 
Yeah, I know. 
That's why I closed the blinds in the first place. 
Right in his office. 
Huh. 
Lemon, I like to think of myself as a winner. 
I like to surround myself with winners. 
I see potential in you. 
Let me be... 
your Jack Welch. 
Let me be your mentor. 
No, thank you. 
That is unfortunate. 
You've,  uh... 
got to admire his persistence and stamina, though. 
Am I wrong, or is he in the middle of a staff meeting? 
Maybe you should be his mentor. 
Obviously, he doesn't need one. 
He's got it all figured out. 
I got one for ya. 
See the old guy over there with the girl? 
Mistress or daughter? 
Oh, my God, I hope it's his daughter. 
Yeah, me too. 
Oh, my God! 
Oh! 
God, I hope it's his mistress. 
Oh, that is just wrong. 
Hey, 007, how about some more rolls over here, huh? 
Oh, my, my, what a pleasant surprise-- Lemon. 
And you brought a man. 
Jack Donaghy. 
And this is my friend Anastasia. 
How are you? 
Hi. Dennis Duffy, 
Beeper King. 
The Beeper King, really? 
Uh, Dennis has his own business. 
Yes, he's an entrepreneur. 
He's very successful. 
You've probably seen my ads on the 7 train, right? 
I didn't know they served chicken nuggets at this restaurant. 
It's cod. It's, uh 
They made it special. 
Dennis has some dietary restrictions. 
Actually, I'm allergic to all fish unless it's fried. 
You know? 
That's a sharp tie you've got there, Dennis. 
That douche bag up front made me wear it. 
Does he know you're the Beeper King? 
I don't think so. 
Anyway, thanks for the hook-up. 
This is clearly the nicest restaurant we've ever been to. 
Hold on a second. 
This place ain't that nice, all right? 
It's got rats and roaches like every other restaurant. 
No rat talk tonight, okay? 
You know there are 17 rats per person in Manhattan? 
You eat a pound of rat crap every year without even knowing it, huh? 
I think I read about that in The New Yorker. 
Anyway, we'll leave you to your meal. 
I hope you enjoy the, uh, choices that you've made. 
Stop it. 
And that former call girl went on to become one of NBC's biggest news anchors. 
Star coming! 
Wall hug, everybody. 
 That's Tracy Jordan. 
He seems like such a nice, normal young man. 
 No! 
Let's keep going, you guys. 
Let's keep goin'. 
I enjoyed the restaurant. 
Thank you. 
Just say it. 
Just say what you're dying to say. 
Dennis is nice to me, okay? 
He fixed my toilet. 
He broke it first, but he fixed it. 
And he loves hockey, and I'm...figuring it out. 
And it's easy I get a lot of work done. 
I don't have time for a personal life, okay? 
I can't just go to Central Park and join the singles touch football league. 
Like I'd want to anyway. 
People in those posters, always laughing in their sweaters. 
Who are they foolin'? 
Oh, okay, you're not going to say anything to me because I rejected you as a mentor? 
Who cares? 
I have a lot of friends I can talk to about my life. 
The bottom line is, Dennis is my boyfriend because he inquired. 
He was the only applicant, and I am not Doin' great. 
Come in. 
Do you have a minute? 
I gotta talk to you about this whole Dennis thing Ah!  What did you do to yourself? 
Me? 
Nothing. 
Just getting more rest, drinking more water. 
Really? This water-- does someone boil it first, 
then throw it in your face? 
Okay, I had a little Botox and some collagen, and a chemical peel, and something with shark DNA. 
Admit it, I look ten years younger. 
No, younger even. 
You look like a fetus. 
Look, I came here to talk to you about my problems with Dennis. 
Oh, I can't right now, honey. 
If I don't do my facial exercises, I could wind up looking weird. 
I just mentioned Dennis, and your eyebrows didn't go up. 
They didn't? 
No. 
How about now? 
Unh-uh. 
Anything? 
Hey, what's up, baby? 
Liz around? 
She should be back soon. 
Is that a present for her? 
Yeah. If she doesn't get back here soon, 
I'm pokin' air holes in it. 
Excuse me. 
I couldn't help but notice that, uh... 
none of you are wearing beepers. 
You sell beepers? 
I sell a way of life, my friend. 
Cool. I can use some ironic accessories. 
What are you doing here? 
Hey, I bought you a present. 
Oh? 
Uh-oh. 
Oh, no. It got out. 
If anyone sees a salamander, it's Liz's. 
No. I don't want a salamander! 
And I don't want you here selling beepers. 
Why not? I mean, you work in a business. 
Business people need beepers. 
No, they need cell phones. 
Oh, yeah, for now. 
But the beeper's gonna be making a comeback. 
Technology's cyclical. 
No technology is not cyclical. 
(Jack) I thought I recognized that voice. 
Dennis, how the heck are you? 
Did you enjoy that restaurant? 
Nah, I think I was right  about that place. 
We actually saw a whole nest of rats when we were leaving. 
No, we didn't. 
I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew you'd freak out. 
Actually, I think I saw a rat king. 
Aren't rat kings a myth? 
What's a rat king? 
Oh, it's when a bunch of rats are crammed into a tiny space, and their tails get all tangled up, and they can't even pull apart. 
And  then it gets awesome. 
Eventually, their bodies fuse together and they form a multi-headed live rat king. 
And we saw one. 
Gosh, I hope you got a picture of that with the camera on your beeper. 
Actually, my beeper doesn't have a camera, but it does have a pedometer. 
Actually, not this one. 
 I love him. 
Listen, I need to talk to you in my office, please. 
 Why? 
 Now. 
What's up? 
Is that a tattoo? 
Uh-huh.  
Who normal now? 
You hear me, America? 
Who's normal now? 
How could you do this to the show? 
I got this tattoo for the good of the show. 
It gives us an edge the reason why you brought me on. 
And when you purchase Tracy Jordan, he comes with a tattoo of a biblical dragon from outer space. 
It's gonna take forever to cover this thing with makeup. 
You can't put makeup on my tattoo, Liz Lemon. 
It's in my contract. 
No, it's not. 
Actually, he's got a pretty weird contract. 
Great. Jenna looks like 
a porn star burn victim, and now this idiot. 
What am I gonna do? 
It's gonna be Josh's busiest show ever. 
Oof... 
Josh? 
Miss Taylor. 
When your office said you were sending me something, I didn't realize it would be you. 
But I had to give you this gift in person, Josh. 
Oh. 
I'm just glad you weren't offended by my impression. 
Oh... 
but I was... 
deeply. 
I'm here to give you the gift... 
of pain. 
The gift of what? 
White diamonds! 
Ha ha! 
Okay, very funny. 
You bought a pager from Dennis. 
Will you take it off now, please? 
Oh, I can't. 
I'm expecting a call from 1983. 
Look, Dennis takes care of me, okay? 
Liz, I'd like you to meet Howard Jorgensen. 
Liz, how do you do? 
He's the vice president of locomotives, and a rising star at GE. 
I thought the two of you had a lot in common. 
You are relentless. 
Look, uh, Howard, you're obviously an attractive and confident guy, and at a different time in my life, I could definitely see the two of us together. 
I'm married with two beautiful kids and a pool. 
(Jack) Liz, I wasn't trying to set you up. 
I wanted to show you my handiwork. 
I used to mentor Howard. 
(Howard) I was a lot like you. 
I dressed poorly, had bad posture, walked around with lettuce in my hair. 
Oh, son of a bitch. 
And I cursed like a sailor. 
But Jack saw potential in me. 
He changed my life. 
Now Howard's earning seven figures and he's married to a swell Filipino gal. 
 Oh, thanks, Jack. 
Look, I told you, I don't need a mentor. 
Fine. 
Liz Taylor really messed him up. 
He might have brain damage. 
(Liz on phone) Oh, my God. 
Maybe the musical guest can do some extra songs this week. 
Who is it? 
James Blunt. 
Oh. 
No, I said no lettuce. 
Are you at that crappy sandwich place again? 
Yeah-- why is everybody judging all of my choices lately? 
This place is fine It's convenient, it's consistent, I know what I'm getting, it doesn't make me feel bad about my body. 
And you know what? 
Maybe I'm at an age where it's okay for me to settle for this. 
Are we still talking about the sandwich place? 
No, sadly, I don't think we are. 
Okay. 
I admit it. 
Dennis isn't a sandwich I want to eat every day for the rest of my life. 
I'm clueless about men. 
I'm clueless about everything that isn't this show. 
Maybe you can tell me how to live, because sadly, you may be the most stable person I know right now. 
Gentlemen, we'll have to continue this conference some other time. 
(Howard on speakerphone) That's her again, isn't it? 
Hi, Howard. (hangs up phone) 
Lemon, today is the first day of the rest of your life, and what is the first thing you need to do? 
I have to break up with Dennis. 
And why is that? 
Because he wears shirts with the Looney Tunes embroidered on them. 
Because he cuts his own hair. 
Because that one little nice thing that he does, doesn't make up for the fact that I don't want to be seen with him in public. 
And if you don't break up with him now? 
He'll just keep showing up at work to sell beepers. 
He'll just keep calling my mother to borrow money. 
We'll just get more and more tangled up in each other's lives until I just can't even get away and we're just like Oh, my God. 
That's right. 
He's the rat king. 
And there's only one way to break up with a rat. 
You have to cut him off completely. 
I know. 
You have to stuff your heart with steel wool and tinfoil. 
You must be ruthless. 
You must to be absolute. 
Remember always, you are The Exterminator. 
Say it. 
I am The Exterminator. 
Say it like you mean it. 
 I am The Exterminator! 
 Louder! 
 I am The Exterminator! 
Okay, not that loud. 
 People are trying to work around here, okay? 
(woman on P.A.) 30 minutes to dress rehearsal. 
Tracy, they need you in wardrobe.  
(woman) That's 30 minutes till dress rehearsal. 
Why is part of your face still on the pillow? 
Damn it. Where's my Sharpie? 
Oh, it is fake! 
Look, I'm crazy, not stupid. 
A movie star can't have a big old permanent face tattoo. 
I just need to walk around with this for a week, get  my picture on the interweb, show the world I'm still dangerous. 
And then what about next week when you don't have it anymore? 
You're gonna look like I had extreme plastic surgery to have it removed. 
Ba-boom! 
That's another "Not Normal." 
You know this is very, very, very bad for me, right? 
I need to protect my reputation. 
You take away my street cred, and I am Wayne Brady. 
Nuh-uh. 
Wayne Brady has three Emmys. 
You have a People's Choice Award that you stole from Wayne Brady. 
I shouldn't expect a white woman from Whiteville to understand street cred. 
First of all, I'm not from Whiteville. 
I'm from White Haven, and it's not as nice as it sounds. 
Oh...fine! 
You can keep the tattoo. 
For this week only. 
(man) Okay, here we go. 
Quiet, please! 
Rehearsing! 
(male announcer) And now, a word from the White House. 
Good evening. 
I'm Laura Bush. 
And I'm Condoleezza Rice. 
 And I'm John Kerry. 
Well, we had a good run. 
What the hell happened here? 
The cast had a rough week. 
These people cannot be on television. 
What is your contingency plan for a crapstorm of this magnitude? 
There is none. 
We go live in a half an hour. 
No wonder your career is being held back by a lack of foresight and an addiction to dysfunctional relationships. 
You have no exit strategies. 
He knows about my marriage? 
No. 
This is gonna be a bad show. 
Worse than the time we let Tracy do that tribute to August Wilson? 
That was my fault. 
I should have made sure he knew who August Wilson was. 
Maybe we'll be pre-empted by some national news event. 
How's Gerald Ford's health? 
Oh, a blackout. 
That'll work. 
(Pete) All right, Nobody panic! 
The backup generator will kick in in just a few seconds. 
Okay, you can panic. 
(Liz) This is real. 
We dodged a bullet here tonight, Lemon. 
Yes, this blackout is a fortunate coincidence. 
You didn't do it, right? 
What, do you think I control the universe? 
Yo, this blackout messed me up. 
I didn't get to debut my dragon face. 
Could I do the Today Show tomorrow? 
No, you're on a plane to Boston tomorrow, Tray. 
We have a laboratory. 
They're experimenting in tattoo removal. 
It promises to be one of our biggest profit centers once today's generation finally sobers up. 
Tattoo's fake, Donaghy. 
Fake. 
Street cred. 
He's a genius. 
(man) Flashlight, $20! 
Flashlight, $20! 
 Can I give you a ride? 
 Flashlight, $20! 
No. I wouldn't want to crowd you. 
Be strong, Lemon. 
Don't let Dennis chew his way out of this one. 
(man) Flashlight, $20! 
Can I borrow 20 bucks? 
(man) Flashlight, $20! 
Dennis, wake up. 
Huh? What? 
You could've burned the place down. 
I wish I had burned the place down. 
There's no reason to live anymore. 
What happened? 
The Islanders lost tonight. 
Doesn't that happen a lot? 
I knew you wouldn't understand. 
So how did it go? 
He moved in with me. 
Well, of course he did. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman No, Jack, I'm not blaming you but everybody got food poisoning. 
Food poisoning? 
That isn't possible. 
That seafood was a gift from my friend, the owner of the Cleveland Browns. 
They're very expensive freshwater clams from the Cuyahoga River. 
My whole staff has been blorching for three days, so if there's any way that we could show a rerun I wish I could help you, Lemon, but I've already sold the ad time to the army. 
Now, do the best you can, I need a live show from you in two days. 
Uh, no, no, no, no. 
That's not for you. 
Bianca's coming. 
Crazy Bianca is coming here? 
You make me wanna vomit. 
Why? 
Because she wants something. 
She only contacts me when she wants something, and she's bringing her lawyer. 
Which means she's gonna try to bleed something else out of me in our divorce proceedings. 
You're not all the way divorced? 
Well, we've been legally separated since 1989. 
It's been a nightmare, Lemon. 
I mean, one minute you're newlyweds making love on the floor of the Concorde, and the next your lawyers are fighting over who gets to keep the box your dog defecates in. 
You taught your dog to poop in a box? 
Bianca did, but I want that box. 
Ugh. 
It's gonna take all day and into the night to deal with that crazy woman. 
Fighting, conniving, clawing at each other. 
Are you angry or excited right now? 
I can't tell. 
Mrs. Donaghy and her lawyer are here. 
I'm sorry, Johnny. 
I'm a little early. 
This would work on Ugly Betty. 
Hey, guys. 
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to work all night tonight till we get caught up. 
What? Liz... 
I can't believe you're gonna make us work all night on Valentine's Day. 
Is it Valentine's Day? 
Oh, I totally forgot. 
Hells, yes, Liz Lemon. 
And I had plans. 
Me and Angie rented the penthouse at the SoHo Grand where we will drink wine and pleasure each other. 
Gross. 
When you been married 17 years, you have to keep it spicy. 
That's why me and my wife role-play. 
She put on a Girl Scout outfit with a box of cookies, and I answer the door in my boxers. 
Or I rent out a wheelchair, and she pretends to be my caseworker. 
And in a way, she is. 
Well, what about me? 
I just took a whole bunch of Cialis 'cause I have big Valentine's plans tonight. 
With who? 
Uh, nobody. 
Okay, you know, I'm sorry, you guys, but we have to get this done. 
Let's order some dinner. 
Cerie, do you mind working late on Valentine's Day? 
No, I don't care. 
Aris and I are in a huge fight anyway. 
Well--Aris? Is that your fianc�, Aris? 
Yeah, he keeps sending me all these flowers to apologize, but he's still insisting on having a Greek Orthodox wedding, but I really disagree with the church's stance on Cyprus. 
Mm, so, um, Chinese? 
Or not? 
Liz, these are actually for you. 
Who are they from? 
I don't know, it doesn't say. 
Secret admirer! 
Too bad you gotta work all night! 
Johnny, thank you for speaking to me in person. 
If this is about the dog box, I'm not giving in. 
Oh, no, Johnny. 
I feel so terrible for what happened at Gerhardt's party. 
Really? I had a fabulous time at that party. 
I want our divorce to be final. 
All right. 
I want back all the jewelry I ever bought you. 
Fine. 
I want the art supplies that I gave you on your 40th birthday and any subsequent art projects you made with them. 
Fine. 
I want all of our love letters. 
Fine. 
I want all of your parents' love letters. 
Fine. 
I want full stake in the Arby's franchise we bought outside of Telluride. 
Oh, damn it, Johnny, you know I love my big beef and cheddar. 
Take it all. 
Take the Arby's, take the house in Amagansett, take the Otto Dix paintings. 
I don't care anymore. 
I wanna move on. 
Mrs. Donaghy intends to relinquish 
all communal property. 
We should have the papers for you to sign tomorrow. 
Then I suppose we're done. 
We're done. 
Break out a bottle of champagne, but not the one that came with the shellfish. 
Get some other bottle of champagne. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Did you send me these to be nice? 
Why would I send you flowers? 
Because it's Valentine's Day Oh, no! It's what? 
It's Valentine's Day? 
Again? 
Oh, did you blow it with your wife? 
It's too late, it's too late, I blew it. 
Well, who cares, you know, it's just Valentine's Day. 
It's also her birthday. 
Ah. 
Oh, I got the turkey club. 
Hey. 
Hey, what's up? 
Did you just come from a Suzanne Somers look-alike contest? 
Hilarious, Frank. 
Actually, I just came from performing at Vagina Day. 
Is that an off-shoot of The Vagina Monologues? 
No, we are in no way affiliated with The Vagina Monologues. 
Vagina Day is a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have, for whatever reason, never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues. 
Every February 14, we improvise monologues about our lady parts for the homeless. 
Oh, to benefit the homeless? 
No, just for them. 
My vagina is a flower. 
A weird ugly flower. 
I remember the night I lost my virginity. 
It was 1968, during the Democratic Convention. 
Lemon, it's done. 
What's done? 
My divorce, it's final. 
 Mwah! 
I'm divorced, everyone! 
Who wants to grab a drink? 
Yeah, I really can't, Jack. 
You're making us work all night, remember? 
Oh. 
Hey, did you send me these because you feel bad? 
I did not and I do not. 
Hey, Pete, you up for a quick cocktail? 
Sorry, I gotta duck out, I just found a Hallmark store open 70 blocks from here! 
Oh, Tracy, what do you say? 
A quick drink to celebrate my freedom? 
Aw, Jackie D., 
any other time, but I made plans with my wife tonight. 
Just one quick one. 
This is the best night of my life! 
All right-- just one! 
I gotta be downtown dressed as a ninja by 10:00. 
Let's go. 
Hey, Frank, marry, boff, kill. 
Beyonc�, Paula Abdul, and Oprah. 
Dude, that's beyond easy. 
Boff Beyonc�, kill Paula, marry Oprah. 
Okay, marry, boff, kill. 
Cerie, Liz, and Jenna. 
Once again, no-brainer. 
Marry Liz, get with Cerie, kill Jenna. 
I can hear you! 
(Liz) Frank, knock it off. 
Don't play that game about people who are in the room. 
Why not? 
Because it always starts out fun and then it gets weird. 
But thank you for saying that you would marry me. 
You didn't send me these, right? 
No. Are you kidding me? 
Hi, um, my name is Liz Lemon, and I received flowers from your shop tonight. 
And I can't tell who they're from. 
No, no, I did read the card, but it's not signed. 
No, I'm not with so many men that it's impossible for me to guess. 
Well, that is just oh, oh, well, you know what? 
I found the card, actually, they're from your mom. 
Yeah, so tell your gay mom I said thanks. 
We gotta order some more champagne, go and jump on my helicopter, and buzz Trump Tower until Don comes out on the roof and begs us to stop. 
Yeah, sounds good! 
I just gotta call my wife, let her know I'm gonna be late. 
Hey, Angie, listen, I'm gonna be Right. 
I have to go. 
No, no, no, no, no, no. 
That is the weak married man inside you talking. 
I used to be like you. 
Always remember, marriage is a competition, and after 18 years of overtime, I am finally going to claim victory! 
You live it up, J.D. 
You know where to find me if you need me. 
Okay, I got a hard one. 
Osama bin Laden, Martha Stewart, Jenna. 
Bone Osama bin Laden, it'd shame him, and then his own people would murder him. 
Marry Martha Stewart 'cause, you know, she seems like a dirty bird. 
And kill Jenna. 
Cerie, marry, boff, kill. 
Lutz, Toofer, or Kenneth. 
I'd marry Toofer 'cause he's classy. 
I'd kill Lutz. Sorry, Lutz. 
The thought that you would do anything to me is awesome. 
And I'd boff Kenneth. 
What? 
Really? 
Okay, what's your problem with me? 
What? 
You're always making rudeomments. 
You never wanna work with me. 
Why don't you like me? 
'Cause you're a big phony. 
What? 
Everything about you is fake. 
Your tan's fake, your hair's fake. 
Not the front! 
You've never done or said anything real or genuine the whole time I've known you. 
Oh, really? 
And does a phony bare her soul for the homeless? 
Because that comes from in here. 
My vagina is a convenience store. 
Clean and reliable. 
And closed on Christmas. 
Fake...and weird. 
Now I would like to propose a toast to my ex-wife who tomorrow I'm going to be saying good-bye to for the very last time. 
(women) Aww. 
No, no. No, no, no. 
She is very, very mentally sick. 
I mean, if you met her, you might think she's wonderful, but believe me, she is the succubus from the bowels of hell. 
I mean, if I were forced to remember her as I first met her, when I first fell in love with her, then, yes, I-I, you know, suppose empirically she is very, very beautiful, but, uh... 
But it's what's inside her that really makes her disgusting. 
I wish I could touch her boobs again. 
She really had a fabulous pair of boobs. 
Ah. 
I admit... 
Sometimes I would fantasize about her getting various terminal illnesses, and... 
I would nurse her. 
To her death. 
And she would say, "Johnny, I'm in so much pain!" 
And I would say, "Just hang in there a little longer, Bianca." 
Love. 
They say that lightning never strikes twice. 
But I know that I will love again. 
And I'm never gonna be happy until I find that woman. 
I think what I'm saying to you is... 
what are you doing tonight? 
Shh. 
 Kenneth. 
This is your chance. 
Cerie digs you. 
Excuse me? 
And she's upset with her fianc�. 
Cerie said she would do it with you. 
Well, that just makes me perspire. 
In fact, I think we need you and Cerie to go on a candy run. 
Okay. 
 But I need to (Lutz) She can't go by herself. 
It's 1:00 in the morning. 
Can I help you? 
Yes, sir. 
We have reports of a nitrogen leak  on this floor. 
Oh, no, our room is fine. 
I mean, we don't smell it. 
Oh, it's odorless, sir. 
I really need to check this room. 
Well, could you hurry up? 
Because my wife and I are planning a really special night tonight. 
Oh, it's for your own safety, sir. 
Mm. 
I'm detecting a lot of heat over here. 
Is it dangerous? 
I don't know. 
I think it's coming... 
from my butt. 
Oh, no, I'm married! 
That's how I like 'em. 
Ah! 
What? Oh! Role-play, baby! 
Give it to me, baby! 
Oh, oh, yeah. 
Okay. 
I don't know who that is, but we done 'cause I'm not velcro-ing up again. 
Just be cool. 
Just be...be cool. 
Hold on tight. 
Who is it? 
Oh, Tracy. 
We couldn't find a hotel room anywhere. 
The whole city is booked. 
We were hoping we could come here and party with you. 
 Happy Valentimes! 
Baby, I'm sorry. 
But he's going through some stuff. 
Angie, do you like champagne? 
No, it gives me a headache. 
This is a Krug Clos de Mesnil. 
I was saving it for a special occasion. 
And I thought to myself, my God, this is it, am I right? 
Good news, good friends. 
I clean this too, or, uh, just the sex? 
Isn't she precious? 
Hey, fun fact about Vlem, she originally came here to study engineering. 
Come on, doll. 
You tell GE light bulb man I want Sophie's Choice out of my suite! 
Babe! 
Lemon! 
Are you coming? 
Let's stall for a minute. 
It's so boring up there anyway. 
You know, Aris is just so immature sometimes. 
That's why I like you, Kenneth. 
You're an old soul. 
Thank you. 
My momma thinks so too. 
In fact, she's pretty sure I'm the reincarnated soul of Adren Twyford. 
He was our town minister who died in an organ fire. 
 Ugh. 
He keeps texting me to meet him downtown at his club, even though he knows I'm working. 
Well, it's like Dr. Laura Schlessinger says, 
"Women should be more accommodating to their men for the health of the marriage." 
She sounds smart. 
Is she really a doctor? 
No, I think she's kinda like Dr. Pepper. 
Well. 
I'm gonna go meet him downtown then. 
Thanks, Kenneth. 
You give really good advice. 
Kenneth. 
What? How dare you? 
You're so weird. 
Tell Liz I left, okay? 
All right. 
Oh, and if you wanna tell those guys upstairs that we made out, it's all right with me. 
Ooh, video games. 
We could play video games. 
This is the second-worst Valentine's Day we ever had. 
Hi, is Mr. Donaghy here? 
Another prostitute? 
Lemon, what do you say? 
You and me, Atlantic City. 
We can be in the crepe line at The Borgata by dawn. 
No, Jack. 
What are you doing? 
I'm celebrating. 
I want Bianca to see that I'm moving on. 
Well then maybe you should call Bianca to help you carry your prostitute out of the hotel you were just ejected from. 
You think I should? 
She'd probably come right down here. 
You two are sick! 
This relationship is sick! 
You just don't understand, it's complicated! 
No, I don't understand! 
Let me ask you a question. 
Marry, boff, kill. Bianca. 
Which do you wanna do? 
All of them. 
All of them. 
You've gotta get out of each other's lives, Jack, or you wilnever be happy. 
Between the two of you, you are 100 years old, and this is not a dignified way for a 100-year-old couple to behave. 
I know. 
I know. 
Uh, oh, leave her there. 
It's nicer than where I found her. 
Come on. 
Happy Valentimes! 
You know what, friend? 
You got a loof nerve, calling me a fake. 
You wear your thrift store T-shirts and your big weird glasses, and everybody says, "Oh, look at Frank, he's so cool. 
He has a hat that says Extra Cheese." 
What does that even mean? 
It's pretty self-explanatory. 
Admit it, you spend just as much time and energy trying to look weird as I do trying to look beautiful. 
And you can act like you hate me, but if I tried to kiss you right now, you would totally do it. 
'Cause you're a big phony jerk! 
And I just wanted to tell you that. 
Okay, fine! 
I pooted. 
It's 3:00 in the morning. 
Are you happy? 
Yeah, I'm happy, because that's the first time you've ever done something like a real person. 
It's pretty cool. 
I-I could do it again, but I wouldn't wanna show off. 
Jenna. 
I'm sorry I said I would kill you. 
Thank you. 
Snacks! 
What happened? 
So? Tell us? 
None of your beeswax. 
He blew it. 
Way to go, loser. 
Oh, yeah? 
If I blew it, then how did I get her underpants? 
Just this last one, and then your marriage is officially dissolved. 
It's almost like it never happened. 
I wouldn't be surprised if that five-inch scar across my abdomen was suddenly gone. 
Johnny. 
Promise me you won't sell the Arby's. 
No, I won't. 
I'm gonna shut it down. 
Leave it vacant. 
Open the windows and let nature have at it. 
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. 
That's prime property on Highway 145. 
Yes, there's not a thing you can do about it. 
But it is irresponsible to the community. 
They should sue you. 
I hope they do. 
Oh, I'll see to it. 
I'll go right to the Telluride Chamber of Commerce. 
Do it. 
The case could be in court for months. 
Maybe years. 
Damn it, Johnny! 
Whoops. Hello. 
I'm sorry. 
Can I help you? 
Hey, that's cool? 
Is that a French Planet of the Apes poster? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
You know, I've heard that in Greece they have to change Charlton Heston's name on movie posters to Charlton Easton. 
Because in Greek the word "Heston" means to poop yourself. 
I'm sorry, do I know you? 
No, I don't think so. 
Uh, you're Liz Lemon, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
Uh, this is super awkward, but did you get two dozen pink roses last night? 
Yep, there they are. 
Those are from you? 
Yes. 
Uh, I work up in legal, and You're a lawyer? 
I prefer law stylist. 
Uh, anyway, I meant to send these to my girlfriend, Liz Lemler, who works in accounting. 
 Oh. 
Yeah. 
There's actually supposed to be a box of chocolatecovered cherries with this, did you I don't know anything about that. 
Fair enough. 
She pouted all night because she thought I forgot to send her something. 
I told her I did, but she didn't believe me. 
She sounds great. 
Yeah, she is. 
Well...good for you. 
Here you go. 
Sorry about the mix up. 
N-no, no! 
They were delivered to you, they're yours now. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
But could I possibly get a photo? 
Of you with the flowers? 
Like with your ID? 
Oh, okay. 
Is that all right? 
You know, just as proof. 
All right. 
There we go. 
Aw, that's a cute one. 
Thanks. 
Sorry to bother you. 
Happy Valentine's Day. 
Happy Valentimes! 
Subs by Raceman and Traff Excuse me. 
There's a line, buddy. 
There's two lines. 
No, no, there's one line. 
We're in it. 
I'm just getting a hot dog. 
We're all getting hot dogs. 
What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line you're the only genius that got in the other line? 
Can you believe this guy? 
Don't line up behind him. 
He cheated you. 
Hey, shut up. 
What do you want on yours, baby? 
I want all the hot dogs, please. 
Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs. 
Oh, come on, lady. 
And I'm giving them to the good people. 
Who's that? 
Kicking it down the street Causin' a stir. 
Who's that? 
I know that you're wondrin' That's her That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her. 
Who's got the kind of charisma that The boys prefer. 
Who's hot and you know that she knows it. 
That's her. 
She's like a summer sky. 
It's like some cherry pie. 
And there is butterfly. 
Me oh my. 
Who flaunts her feminine magic. 
That's her That's me! 
That's Pam! 
The overly-confident morbidly obese woman. 
This fat suit smells like corn chips. 
Going again, please. 
Thank you. 
And this is the set of The Girlie Show. 
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies. 
Hey, everybody. 
Look, here's someone you never get a chance to meet. 
It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon! 
The Girlie Show. 
Hold on, I'll connect you. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch? 
It's still seven minutes long. 
Yikes, okay. 
Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit. 
But why? 
Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina. 
Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out. 
Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch. 
Oh, you mean Ken? 
Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group. 
I'll talk to him. 
What is this? 
Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules? 
Yes, I do. 
Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners. 
Atta boy. 
Chumley. 
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible. 
Oh, good morning, sunshine. 
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee. 
Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser. 
That's what a samovar is. 
Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel? 
Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee? 
No, thank you. 
No? 
Hey, Josh. 
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing. 
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Check it out. 
So, uh, President Bush is in the news again. 
Have you heard about this? 
No, Jay Leno. 
The host of the Tonight Show. 
I thought that's what I was doing. 
So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars. 
You know? 
No, no. Like Jay Leno. 
Like, "Hey, here are the headlines." 
You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you How is that different from what I was doing, though? 
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group. 
I agree. 
I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not. 
Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy. 
I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger. 
Sure you will. 
I just I just love television so much. 
We all do. 
Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor. 
Who, Gary? 
Tell him I'll be up in half an hour. 
No, they said now. 
If they got cookies up there,  grab some. 
Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar. 
Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about. 
What about, uh, Ray Romano? 
Can you do Ray? 
Hey. God, oh. Debra. 
There you go. 
My brother's tall. 
Right? 
Are we in trouble or something? 
No way. 
Gary loves the show. 
Pleased with the ratings. 
Right.  Of course. 
They love us. 
Where's Gary? 
Gary's dead. 
I'm Jack Donaghy. 
New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart. 
Oh, we own Kmart now. 
No. So why are you dressed 
like we do? 
I'm surprised you're renovating. 
This is such a nice office. 
It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to, uh, make them your own. 
Please. 
Ah, I'll call her back. 
Is she at the White House line? 
Great. 
Tell them I need a 4:00 a.m. tee off time. 
Uh, five inches, but it's thick. 
Are you familiar with the GE Tri-vection Oven? 
I don't cook very much. 
Sure, I got you. 
New York, third wave feminist, college educated. 
Single and pretending to be happy about it. 
Overscheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says "Healthy body image" on the cover. 
And every two years, you take up knitting for... 
A week. 
That is dead on! 
What, are you gonna guess my weight now? 
You don't want me to do that. 
That knitting thing is uncanny. 
How do you do that? 
Market research, my friend. 
Years and years of market research, which lead to my greatest triumph. 
The Tri-vection oven. 
Oh, my wife wants one of those. 
Could we get Pete an oven, please? 
Hey. 
The GE Tri-vection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven, because it uses three kinds of heat. 
Thermal  technology for consistent temperature. 
GE Precise Air convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed. 
With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes. 
Wow. 
That is impressive. 
The people upstairs think so. 
That's why they promoted me. 
That's why they sent me here to retool your show. 
Retool what now? 
I'm the new vice president of east coast television and microwave oven programming. 
That sounds like you program microwave ovens. 
I like you. 
You have the boldness of a much younger woman. 
Lee, does my face look bloated to you? 
When I played that lady rapist on Law & Order, guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out? 
Hemorrhoid cream. 
Ms. Maroney? 
I have the cat wrangler here for you. 
Oh, is it that horrible little--Hi. 
Hey. Greta Johannsen. 
It's short for "LaGreta." 
Hi, great to see you again. 
You too. I'm here 
to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight. 
Okay. 
This is Po-Po. 
And this here is Captain Boots. 
Hello. 
Uh, would you describe yourself as "cat competent?" 
Oh, yes. I love cats. 
I used to have two cats. 
But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down. 
I'm joking. 
I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays. 
Jenna, that's my friend Jenna. 
And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49. 
I'm not missing them, they're just not there. 
I think I can fix that. 
So your job is, you take things that are already working, and you fix them. 
That's a great job. 
Okay, let's Why don't we, um You're missing that third kind of heat. 
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan. 
Okay--the black guy? 
The black movie star. 
I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining. 
Isn't he, um... 
crazy? 
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years. 
I am a Jedi! 
I am a Jedi! 
I am a Jedi! 
The important thing to remember is, he was never charged with a crime. 
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof. 
Nor should it be. 
Tracy Jordan is the third heat. 
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan. 
I think I do. 
What are you doing? 
Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it. 
"This is not a dream." 
Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz. 
I'd like you to have lunch with him. 
We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy. 
I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal, and then a live show. 
That's  tonight. 
This is lunch. 
If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing. 
If I meet with Tracy Jordan, and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off? 
I'm known for being reasonable. 
Okay. 
Alfredo, 2:00 p.m. 
I'm not dressed for that. 
You're dressed for Burger King. 
Should we make it Burger King? 
Pete, hang back for me. 
Yeah, you bet. 
Hey. 
What happened to your head? 
Uh, the sky is falling. 
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow? 
Thank you, Lee. 
Whatever. 
Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch? 
Do I have to hold a real cat? 
Cat Lady sketch? 
That thing's gonna get cut. 
Oh, good. 
Who's that? 
That is the new network dude. 
Mmm, yummers. 
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital. 
What? No, ew, Jenna. 
Do not like that man. 
That is a bad man. 
God, you have a gift. 
Laura Bush is your size. 
Hi, uh, what are you doing down here? 
I'm known for being hands-on. 
Clearly. 
That's how you should dress for work, by the way. 
Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines. 
Afghanistan is a different situation... 
I'll have an apple juice. 
Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir. 
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic. 
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.  
I know who you are. 
I thought there was a... 
strict dress code at this place. 
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli. 
They're very subtle. 
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show. 
And I don't know how you feel about that Lemme ask you a question. 
Everybody at this table. 
Did  he just say the word "pumpkin" to me? 
Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli. 
Yo! I'm buggin'. 
I can't do this. 
I cannot eat here. 
I can't eat here. 
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like. 
Lemon, let's go. 
I will not work with Tracy Jordan. 
It's just a rumor. 
Have you seen any of his movies? 
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous. 
I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters. 
Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop. 
No. 
Who Dat Ninja? 
No, he-- He had to pretend to be this old lady... 
Ooh, ooh, ooh! 
Goodness gracious! 
You hooligans better watch out. 
'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'! 
Oh, yeah. 
That movie was hilarious. 
I saw it like five times. 
Where's the love? 
Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles. 
Nothing for me, I I had, like, four hot dogs this morning. 
Eat, Lemon. 
Eat! 
I hate skinny women. 
Hey, Lorna. 
Ten beers. 
So, Tracy, we should talk about the show. 
Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way. 
You know, I want it to be raw. 
HBO-style content. 
Well, it's not HBO. 
It's TV. 
And I don't think that it's a good fit You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs. 
You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack? 
That's racism. 
I'm not on crack. 
I'm straight up mentally ill! 
Sure. 
I got mental health issues. 
Sure, well, you know... 
Who doesn't, really? 
Hey, has anyone seen Liz? 
Or Pete? 
She went out. 
Well, who's in charge when they're not here? 
I'm in charge. 
Oh. Okay. 
Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume. 
I think it's hot. 
Thank you. 
I'm Jenna, by the way. 
Ms. Moroney, I got 
the hemorrhoid cream you wanted. 
It's for my face. 
Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working. 
You know, I don't I don't think you'd like it. 
'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
I like risky. 
See, me and you, we play the game. 
We know how to be acceptable. 
Hello, great meeting. 
I drink coffee, please. 
This show is our chance to break the shackles. 
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail. 
What white dudes? 
All of 'em. 
Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe. 
Karl Robe, you say? 
Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other. 
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets. 
That's a metaphor. 
Sure. 
You should tell that to Us Weekly. 
Hey, Lemon. 
You like karaoke? 
I know a joint. 
No, no, I I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy. 
I'll take you. 
I'll take you. 
I just gotta make a quick stop first. 
You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store. 
No, thank you. 
You know what, this is for computer classes. 
Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon? 
I really don't. 
To get you rich. 
'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up. 
How do you know I'm not rich? 
Your teeth. 
You got to think like these strippers, Lemon. 
They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment. 
You gotta get in when you're young. 
Get the money and get out. 
Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy. 
I don't have sex for a living. 
Neither do we. 
Neither do they. 
Yes, they do. 
Where is my phone? 
We are strong No one can tell us we're wrong Searching our hearts for so lo-ong He's got charisma. 
No, that's Charisma over there. 
Girlie Show. 
Ken, send me a car, okay? 
What is your location? 
Dark Sensations, in the Bronx. 
I wish you were here. 
Mr. Donaghy does not get 
us showbiz people. 
Let me talk to Pete, okay? 
Oh, Pete got fired this morning. 
That's so weird that you don't know that. 
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show? 
Hell no. 
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show. 
You know, I moved from Chicago for this. 
From Chicago? 
I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding. 
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us. 
He already fired Pete, who is a great producer. 
He fired Pete? 
He can't fire Pete. 
You know what, I quit. 
He can suck it. 
Mm-hmm.  
Yeah, suck it, Pete. 
No, you're not listening. 
You're not a good listener. 
20 minutes to air. 
But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch. 
She said it stinks. 
Ouch. 
This is why Liz is wrong. 
Animal humour is universal. 
I  just don't think that I'm good in it. 
Do you think I'm good in it? 
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong. 
What--what do you mean? 
Who's everybody? 
The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye You mean this eye? 
Okay, this eye It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it. 
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds. 
What? 
Where is Liz? 
Liz?! 
Four minutes to air. 
That's four minutes to air. 
Is Liz back yet? 
No, which cat do you want Jenna to carry? 
I'm sorry? 
Which cat? 
Oh. 
I want...that one. 
Jack Donaghy to the control room, please. Jack Donaghy. 
Peanut's not an actor. 
I just--I just rescued him from a lab. 
Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off. 
Where do you live? 
The studio. 
I want you to drop me at the studio. 
I want to tell Donaghey to his face that I quit. 
And I want to do it in front of the whole crew, so that they know he didn't fire me. 
I wanna see that. 
Gonna turn the lights down low. 
It's almost time for the Girlie Show Ooh, ooh, pull over. 
Pull over here. 
Tracy, I don't have time for this. 
This is where I grew up. 
This is the Jordan family estate? 
Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'. 
This is where I was in foster care. 
Oh. Sorry. 
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers. 
I'm so lucky I got out of here. 
It's not luck, I mean... 
You got out of here because you're very talented, and... people love you, and... 
Are you peeing? 
Where's Donaghy? 
I wanna talk to him right now. 
Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera. 
Oh, I have Pete for you. 
Pete, oh, my God. 
I didn't know. 
No, hey, listen. 
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids. 
I'm quitting. 
I'm quitting right now. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
You have the best job in New York. 
Don't quit over this. 
Don't buy all the hot dogs. Okay? 
I don't want to do this without you. 
Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch. 
We're two minutes short! 
So, let me introduce myself. 
My name is Lurleen Katz. 
And these are my cats. 
She's using a real cat? 
I cast that cat myself. 
And sir, while they are my Ow! Aaugh! 
No, no, no, no, no. 
He's okay. 
I need you to talk for two minutes. 
About what? 
Anything. 
All right. 
These cats are more than just pets, sir. 
Why, just this morning Excuse me! 
Where is the manager? 
I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets. 
Uh-oh. 
Look at Shorty. 
This honky grandma be trippin'. 
What's up, America? 
I'm coming into your house live. 
Lemme hear you say "We love you, Tracy." 
We love you, Tracy! 
I am the third heat! 
He's brilliant. 
Are you drunk? 
Yes. 
Why did you fire Pete? 
Why did you disappear all night? 
Is this some kind of a power play? 
Yeah, yeah. 
It's not so fun being "hands on" with these bloodsuckers, is it? 
Could we talk about this on Monday? 
No. I want Pete back. 
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room. 
Fine. 
I thought you were going to quit. 
Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me. 
You weigh 127 pounds. 
Yeah. 
Thank you, good night. 
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer. 
Good night, sleep tight. 
I can't wait to do this with you every week. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman What class do you wanna take? 
Oh, anything that doesn't have the word "strip," "salsa," or "beatz" with a Z in the name of it. 
Cardio Hip-Hop Groove it is then. 
Hey, what's up? 
Hey! 
Nothing, just... going into 
the same class you're going into. 
Cool. 
That's a flower guy. 
Hey, I hope I don't sweat on you. 
You can sweat on me. 
This is my girlfriend, Liz Lemler. 
Hi! 
That's Liz Lemon. 
Oh, the girl who got my flowers. 
Yes. 
Hope you enjoyed them. 
I did--actually, I finally just threw them out this morning 'cause they got that really bad flower smell. 
I kind of couldn't stop smelling them. 
Advanced hip-hop! 
You ready, here we go! 
Here we go, take it five, six, seven, and... 
One, huh! 
Hup, yeah! 
Uh! Whoo! 
Turn it! 
Don't give up, ponytail. 
Come on, you got this. 
Lemon, come here, you've gotta see this. 
It's a video of a baby panda... sneezing. 
Sit here. 
Don't watch the mother, just watch the baby. 
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen. 
Isn't that adorable? 
You have to fire 10% of your staff. 
What? 
We're synergizing backward overflow. 
I don't write the policy, Lemon, I only enforce it. 
No, but I've never fired anybody in my life. 
It's an acquired skill. 
I'm not trying to make your life miserable, but this is coming from the top. 
Now, there are 140 people on this show, so go out there and make 126 people very happy. 
No, I don't think I can do that. 
Everyone that works at this show is indispensable. 
Marco. 
Polo! 
Marco! 
Polo! 
Polo! 
Polo! 
Josh, you suck at this game, man. 
10%? I can't fire any of these people. 
Who cares? 
Getting fired is better than getting killed by my wife. 
Those big farm people hands crushin' my windpipe. 
Everything okay at home, buddy. 
Remember that little secret I told you about Hornberger family planning? 
You mean that you flat-out lied about getting a vasectomy? 
Don't tell me that backfired. 
She's late now. 
And she's starting to ask questions. 
Oh, boy. 
Do you need a key to my apartment? 
Just for my own safety. 
Hey, Liz Lemon, you know where I can find a good church? 
How good, like Judaism good, or just like Unitarian? 
My attorney told me I should join a church preemptively. 
'Cause juries are suspicious of celebrities who find religion after getting into trouble. 
Why don't you try the Church of Practicology? 
They love movie stars and stuff. 
They already turned me down. 
I'm still not sure what happened. 
I believe the moon doesn't exist. 
I believe that vampires are the world's greatest golfers, but their curse is that they'll never get to prove it. 
I believe that there are 31 letters in the white alphabet. 
Wh--what was the question again? 
So what's your religion, Liz Lemon? 
Mm, I pretty much just do whatever Oprah tells me to. 
Can I help you? 
Yes, sweetheart. 
I'm looking for Jack Donaghy. 
And you are? 
Eddie Dona-hee, Jack's brother. 
Really? 
'Cause Jack never mentioned a brother. 
And his name is Dona-gee, not Dona-hee. 
You know, you could be pretty if you didn't scowl so much. 
Tracy, this is Jack's brother, Eddie. 
Hi. 
Look who I found. 
Eddie Donaghy. 
As I live and breathe. 
You're a disgrace! 
You're not the boss of me, Jack Donaghy! 
That's Dona-gee, not Dona-hee! 
You ruined my suit! 
Aw, shut up, you baby! 
Oh, my God, stop! 
Someone's gonna get hurt! 
Look, this is about Dad. 
What'd you two dirtbags do now? 
Fix the Cotton Bowl? 
Dad's dead. 
It's over. 
Okay? 
This watch was Dad's. 
He wanted you to have it. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm okay. 
I haven't seen my dad in 17 years. 
I haven't seen Eddie since I bailed him out of Disney jail. 
And now this watch. 
I'm sorry. 
Don't be. 
My dad and Eddie are a blotch on the Donahee name Dona-gee name. 
That's how it's pronounced. 
Say it. 
Donaghy. 
Right. 
I really appreciate you bringing me to your church, Ken. 
Hola, Julio. 
I'm glad to help you on your spiritual quest, Mr. Jordan. 
What kind of Presbyterian is this? 
No, we're the Eighth Day Resurrected Covenant of the Holy Trinity. 
We haven't been Presbyterian for months. 
And y'all always meet on Wednesday nights? 
Yeah, we lose half the congregation every time American Idol starts up. 
Reverend Gary's starting. 
God sees the wicked one. 
Eternal damnation is upon the sinner. 
The stench of rotten flesh fills the air. 
Judgment is upon us all! 
How will you be seen in his eyes? 
What? 
He pointed right at me! 
He sure did! 
No! 
The fires of the pit crackle and pop. 
Hi, I got you coffee. 
Thanks. 
Oh, I forgot your muffin! 
Banana walnut, your favorite. 
Uh, that's not correct, but okay. 
Good morning, Liz. 
What's all this? 
Sketches, promos, web content. 
Thoughts for next season. 
Uh-huh. Nice hat. 
You haven't heard anything about layoffs, have you? 
What? No! 
And even if I had, I'm just being normal. 
Gosh. 
Okay. 
Hey, Liz! 
You wanna hang out tonight? 
'Cause you're totally my role model. 
You make smart sexy. 
There's my beautiful boss. 
Good morning! 
Good morning, Henry. 
There you go. 
The YMCA, huh? 
Congratulations, you've found me out. 
So your life's a mess, you go out and buy a new suit, pretend everything's okay. 
But...what happened, Eddie? 
What do you care? 
I'm happy here. 
Gordon, so help me! 
Look, I went broke taking care of Dad-- end of story. 
Then let me give you some money. 
No, seeing Dad at the end, it changed me, Jack. 
I got a real job now. 
I talk homeless people into joining the Army. 
Isn't there anything that you want? 
One thing. 
I'd like my brother back. 
Look, I know I've been nothing but trouble to you your entire life. 
Juvie, Jonestown, that time I punched Goofy. 
Hell, I even blinded you with a bottle rocket! 
Ah, that was for a couple of lousy months, big deal. 
I had sex with your prom date. 
I stole your identity. 
I threw you out of a window. 
I convinced you you had lupus. 
I microwaved your parakeet. 
I hated that bird. 
We had some great times, didn't we? 
Yeah. 
Hmm, you're on my good list, Cary. 
Hey, sorry about that. 
Not super appropriate... 
in the workplace. 
No, it's... 
it's only inappropriate when it's ugly people. 
So, um, how long have you guys been together? 
Oh, well... that's tricky. 
Uh, kind of off and on the past year. 
But then she got this job here, and... 
It's kinda tough to stay broken up with someone you have to see everyday. 
Where does she work? 
Your Liz. 
In accounting. 
On your show. 
She works for you. 
I know who I can fire! 
You can't fire the other Liz unless she's in the bottom 10%. 
Ugh, you can just tell she is by her stupid face! 
You're a better person than this. 
Jack has given me absolute power. 
I am the decider. 
Okay, you can't just do this. 
I'm not gonna just do anything. 
I have a plan. 
Step one, befriend the enemy and gather information. 
Then use the information to drive her into the bottom 10%. 
Good Lord...your eyes. 
You look like that lady astronaut who tried to kidnap that other woman. 
Hey, that was a lady with a plan. 
Diapers, Mace, Houston to Orlando in nine hours? 
Blammo. 
I know I'm the guy who lied to his wife about having a vasectomy, but this... 
this is wrong. 
No, it's not wrong! 
I'm just staying the course, and I'm enjoying it. 
Jack is out of my hair, people are being nice to me. 
There's a guy I like in the building, and I have the authority to fire his girlfriend? 
For the first time ever, things are lining up for old Liz Lemon. 
Stop! Stop it! 
Jack, come on. 
Mr. Donaghy, 
your assistant's been looking for you. 
Oh, thank you very much, Kenneth. 
Uh, Eddie and I have just been making up for some lost time. 
Hey, Jack, uh, you mind if I take a few grapes for dinner later? 
Why don't you just take the money? 
No. 
If you wanna give money to someone, you give it to those nurses who took care of Dad at Chicago All Saints Hospital. 
They never once said anything about the racist stuff towards the end. 
All right, I'll have my assistant write a check. 
Help yourself to some grapes. 
But you had to go to the bathroom, so Dad missed seeing Meredith Vieira! 
Now I'm pissed! 
Not one of you kids is ever gonna amount to anything. 
That's why your mom left. 
Yeah. 
Maybe we should get all the Donaghy kids back together again. 
Aw, Jack, they don't wanna see me. 
Oh, come on, we're Irish. 
We're a forgiving people. 
Aww! 
I'm so glad you asked. 
Kabbalah is a wonderful religion that mixes the fun part of Judaism with magic. 
So where do you worship? 
Where don't you worship? 
My friend, Madonna... 
Hey, Jack's brother. 
What religion are you? 
This one sounds really expensive and gay. 
Oh, well, uh, I'm Irish Catholic. 
Now, I know there's been a lot of controversy around the church lately. 
You know, because of The Da Vinci Code. 
But what's great is you can do anything, anything, and as long as you go to confession, it's forgiven. 
I'm Irish Catholic. 
Well, well, other Liz. 
Played saxophone in the marching band at Rutgers? 
Kept that a secret from your employer, didn't you? 
Excuse me, Liz. 
Jack said it'd be okay if I put this here. 
It's, uh, for the hospital that took care of my dad. 
Oh, yeah--I'm so glad to see you and Jack getting along. 
Uh, absolutely, we we'll give money, right? 
You want us to give money? 
I'd be happy to. 
Heart of gold, L.L. 
Is there a limit to how much we can give? 
I hope not. 
Let's get our checkbooks! 
Yeah! 
Wow. 
I bet Pops is looking down right now and saying, "If I could come back and do any broad, it'd be that one right there." 
Ew. 
So Pop says, "What does it look like I'm doing right now?" 
So they ended up landing in Dallas for six hours and it was on the news! 
It was not on the news, you're such a liar. 
Excuse me, everybody, this is Kenneth. 
Kenneth, this is my family. 
That's Patrick, this is Patricia, this is Katherine Catherine, and her husband Bobby, and this is, uh, Margaret. 
We just found out about her today. 
Oh, uh, welcome! 
Kenneth's going to take you all downstairs to the studio. 
I would like to make a toast to Pop. 
Well, we've been toasting Pop for over an hour now. 
Maybe we should pace ourselves. 
You know what, why don't you stop trying to control everything, Jack? 
He was a wonderful father. 
He was always ready with a joke. 
Or rum balls in his pockets for the kids. 
Eddie? 
Come here, you magnificent douche bag! 
Eddie! 
How the hell are ya? 
Have a drink. 
Uh, actually I've been clean and sober for seven months. 
Stop showing off and have a drink. 
Sure. 
Hey, Liz. 
Oh, hey, Liz. 
Right, so I'm doing these quick performance reviews. 
I'm gonna be doing them with everybody every six months or so, so, um, are you settling in okay? 
Yeah, everyone's been great. 
Learning where stuff is. 
What would you say are your weaknesses? 
Some people say I'm too nice. 
Where do you see yourself in five years? 
Well, hopefully, I'll still be working for G.E. 
It's a great company for working moms. 
What? 
You know, in five years. 
In--I mean, I'm in a relationship right now. 
By then I'll probably have a couple of kids, be living in the suburbs just having it all, really. 
You're fired! 
I'm the decider! 
Uh... 
God, I missed you guys. 
It's too bad it took Dad dying to get us all together again. 
He was always bringing people together. 
He was just like Lady Di. 
He was. 
This is Margaret. 
Boy, she's really got Mom's smile, doesn't she? 
Yeah. 
To Pop! 
The sorriest bastard that ever walked the earth. 
Don't say that about my daddy! 
Oh, Patricia, you're embarrassing yourself. 
Yeah, well, you don't say that about my father, Mrs.! 
What do you say... 
Good posture, who cares? 
Uh, what do you say we all head downstairs right now before this takes the traditional Donaghy turn for the worse. 
Seriously, don't even start with me! 
Don't start with me, Mrs.! 
You did it, you fired her? 
Uh-huh. 
You cant' do that, Liz! 
I'm gonna tell human resources! 
No, no, you're not! 
You're fired! 
Did you just fire Pete? 
Yes! I'm gonna put his name on a list! 
And everything! 
Can I help you? 
Ms. Lemon, the, uh, accounting department 
wishes to protest the firing of our colleague. 
Now, we have discussed it You're fired! 
You're all fired! 
Clean out your desks! 
Fired! 
Lemon, the purpose of these cuts is to make us more efficient so we make more money. 
And the people who tell me if I'm making more money are called accountants. 
And if I don't have any accountants No, Jack, you would be proud of me. 
It's all part of a plan. 
It just got out of control. 
A plan to do what? 
Things were really lining up for old Liz Lemon. 
And this other Liz, this accountant girl, was just getting in the way of my happiness. 
Your happiness? 
Lemon, is this about a boy? 
Mm-hmm. 
Good God in heaven. 
Who is he? 
What's his name? 
Flower guy? 
Lemon, you've gone chicken killer on me over a guy whose name you don't know? 
And you still think our next President should be a woman? 
He just seems like a really cool guy, and I think he likes me more than her. 
That's...very sad. 
It really is, isn't it? 
I'm gonna go talk to some food about this. 
Oh, Liz, did you put your check in already? 
Oh, no. 
Who do I make it out to? 
Chicago All Saints Hospital? 
Eddie just said to write the initials on the check. 
C... 
A... 
S... 
H. 
Son of a bitch. 
Eddie already took the other box. 
Son. 
Dad? 
Your brother Eddie's dead. 
He wanted you to have his watch. 
Eddie. 
You. 
Me? 
You! What are you doing here? 
What do you think? 
I'm pulling the Dead Man's Curve on Jack. 
When we parted ways, we agreed that I would get Jack and you would do the thing in Sacramento! 
You are both a disgrace to the Donaghy name! 
It's pronounced Dona-fee, you lace curtain half-an-Englishman! 
When I think of all the things that I've been holding inside me that I wanted to say to you... 
Well, now I'm gonna let St. Patrick 
and St. Michael do my talking for me! 
You'll have to get through Tip O'Neill and Bobby Sands first! 
You call those fist names? 
Say hello to Bono and Sandra Day O'Connor! 
Those are the stupidest fist names I've ever heard. 
Daddy's not dead! 
Eddie, you lying sack of crap! 
Jack Donaghy, you don't raise your fists to my dead father! 
Bobby, give me my keys. 
Let's go! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Yeah, what--what are you doing? 
You can't fight in front of my audience! 
What, do you think you're better than me? 
Lemon, are you okay? 
I want you...to punch 
your sister in the face. 
It's on. 
I call same sides as the bicentennial brawl! 
I was impressed by how you take a punch, Lemon. 
I played dead for the worst of it, but it didn't fool your family. 
It sure didn't. 
The whole thing was strangely reassuring, though. 
To know that they'll be there after I'm dead, fighting over my corpse before it's cryogenically frozen. 
Where's Eddie now? 
I gave him and my dad a three-day head start out of love and sportsmanship. 
Hmm. 
As always, it's been a pleasure fighting with you. 
Oh, I had to rehire that Liz Lemler that you fired. 
Okay. 
And I didn't want any more trouble with her, so I had to give her a promotion too. 
Fantastic. 
It's an amazing opportunity for her out at, uh, corporate headquarters. 
In Connecticut? 
She's transferred to Connecticut? 
Yes. 
That's right. 
It seems that things are lining up once again for old Liz Lemon. 
And you say? 
Thank you, Jack. 
You're welcome. 
I hear your girlfriend got transferred. 
Sorry. 
Yeah. 
I guess it wasn't meant to be. 
Liz! 
You forgot to give me the key to your place, and I need it, my wife knows about our little secret. 
I don't know how she found out. 
Oh, God. 
I should've just gotten a vasectomy! 
Let me explain. 
Hey, did you hear the good news, J. D.? 
I'm IrisCatholic now. 
Like you, Regis, and the Pope. 
Oh, no, you're not. 
The church already has enough lawsuits. 
See, I could screw up now, and then just go to confession. 
No longer do I have to throw my parties in international waters. 
That's not how it works, Tracy. 
Even though there is the whole confession thing, that's no free pass. 
Because there is a crushing guilt that comes with being a Catholic. 
Whether things are good, or bad, or you're simply eating tacos in the park. 
There is always the crushing guilt. 
I don't think I want that. 
I'm out. 
Somehow I feel oddly guilty about that. 
I don't want nothing crushing me. 
Oh, garlic. Not that. 
Sorry, I don't shake hands.|I have avian bone syndrome. 
Hollow bones. 
Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders|are coming for you. 
The top law firm in Cleveland wants me. 
God's sakes, Tracy, where are you? 
Starting a new life. 
Because of the Black Crusaders?|That's crazy. 
 Will you marry me?| No. 
I took that job. 
Blurgh. 
Where was Kenneth?|Let's find out. 
Cough. 
And cough. 
And cough. 
Okay, now let's start the examination. 
 Are you getting enough sleep?| No. 
 You drinking water?| No. 
 Are u exercising at all?| No. 
 And you're still working those long hours?| Yes. 
I feel great. 
My wedding's in a couple of days. 
Your 18th, right?|Same as Bianca's. 
I guess our friends|will just have to choose between us. 
My mother's coming up from Florida|to attend Bianca's wedding, so it's perfect. 
Do you... 
have any questions about the wedding night? 
You know, you're actually|in better shape than last year. 
You lost a couple pounds,|your lab work is good, and your blood pressure is... 
310 over 280!|We have a winner. 
How's the stress eating? 
Under control. 
Still not eating right, huh? 
No, but I am eating a lot. 
You sound stressed. 
My boyfriend is moving to Cleveland. 
But I'm gonna go visit him|over vacation. 
And my boss is super-mad at me because I know that he fell asleep|on top of his fianc�e. 
Have I given you my new book? 
It's about having|a satisfying love life. 
For life. 
Is that you in these pictures? 
My techniques guarantee male orgasm. 
And it's the season finale|of my show this week, and the star is missing,|and my have been abducted by a cabal of powerful black celebrities! 
That sounds stressful. 
Has anybody heard from Tracy at all? 
Grizz, Dotcom, anything? 
Well, I guess if he's not back by tomorrow morning,|we'll give some of his parts to Josh and... 
cut the rest. 
Can I play Barack Obama? 
No, it's bad enough|we have Tracy playing Barack Obama. 
I'm trying to get a head count|for the end-of-the-year party. 
Should I include Tracy and his guests,|or do you think he's dead? 
He's not dead, he's just... 
Lemon, could I speak with you a moment? 
I know you and I are not on good terms. 
But we do need to work together|to bring Tracy back here. 
Do you think I'm trying to not find Tracy? 
Well, Lemon, I cannot endure another failure. 
Jack, trust me. 
Nobody wants to do the show without Tracy. 
We used to do it every week without him. 
I'm just saying. 
Ugh! I hope he's okay. 
I hope he's taking his medication. 
And I hope he took a jacket,|'cause it can get real chilly there. 
I'm sorry, but I swore|I wouldn't tell anyone where Tracy is. 
Kenneth, my ex-girlfriend|is a member of the Black Crusaders. 
I can make all this go away. 
My lips are sealed. 
Key in pocket. 
 You are pissing off the wrong guy, Parcell.| You turdfaced goon. 
 I will cut you open like a tauntaun...| You tell me where he is.... 
you mouth-breathing Appalachian! 
Fine. 
I will tell you. 
Right now. 
That you are never gonna find him. 
Mr. Jordan! 
Mr. Jordan! 
Uh, I think you have me|confused with someone else. 
My name is Gordon Tremeshko. 
Oh. 
I'm Jesse Parcell. 
Kenny's cousin. 
Kenny should have given you the code word. 
What? 
That's it! 
Such a thrill to meet you. 
Hey, thanks for taking me in, Jesse. 
I won't be a burden. 
Now make me a smoothie|and let's go clubbing. 
Oh...we don't have dancin' or liquor here. 
But cousin Kenneth sent me all your movies. 
At night, I laugh so hard,|it really riles up the wolves, yeah! 
Oh, I loved Honky Grandma Be Trippin'! 
This Check it, check it. 
Now, you boys sit down, so this honky grandma gonna|show you how to break dance! 
Then he went--ooh! 
Check it two times. 
It was so funny,|I nearly wet my other pair of underpants! 
Did you call Tracy's wife on the phone? 
Yeah, as far as she knew, he's been shooting|a vampire movie in Bucharest since February. 
Lemon, I'm getting married|in a couple of days, and I don't need any more stress|in my life right now. 
Jackie-kins! 
Colleen! I mean, Mom! 
Ohh! Never mind! 
Well, well, well, well, well. 
Ha ha, this must be the one. 
Huh? 
Phoebe. Welcome! 
 No, no, no.| No, I 
Welcome, welcome, welcome! 
Mother, mother... this is not Phoebe. 
No, no. This is not Phoebe? 
Well, why the hell not? 
I mean, she's perfect. 
Character, she got strength of character. 
And I'll tell you something else. 
She's got a good, solid, baby bucket. 
You are a sassy old broad, aren't you? 
Hello. 
Uh, mother, this is Phoebe. 
Phoebe, this is my mother. 
Hello, Mother Doneghy. I'm Phoebe. 
It's such a pleasure to meet you. 
I love your little hat. 
Oh, my God. 
Hmm. 
I'll get it. 
Hello? 
Rooster, this is the farmer.|Is the egg safe? 
The egg is in the nest. 
Good. 
But be careful. 
The badger and the bear|have been asking questions. 
I don't know who you're talking about. 
Listen, you don't have|to worry about Tracy, okay? 
He's with his biggest fan. 
Hillbilly. 
 Hayseed.| Was that Kenneth? 
What's going on in New York? 
Did he go to Russell Simmons' birthday party? 
Were there girls there with butts? 
Mr. Jordan, you need to|forget about New York. 
You're not a movie star anymore. 
Your name's Gordon Tremeshko. 
You live in Needmore, Pennsylvania,|where we don't go out at night. 
'Cause of the wolves. 
Right. 
I nearly almost got through the whole season|without him going completely bonkers. 
But now, you know, he's just gone. 
And if he doesn't get back in time,|I'm gonna have to rewrite the whole show. 
Hey, I'm sorry, but can we talk|about something besides work? 
Um, okay. 
What's the weather like there? 
Um... 
it's actually in the mid-40s. 
Oh, really, 'cause it's--|it's low '40s here. 
Really? 
 Yeah.| Wow. 
So what are you doing? 
I'm, uh... 
I'm waiting for the bus. 
So, uh... 
I should probably just focus--|focus on that, you know. 
 Oh, okay. Um, call me later?| Ok, bye. 
No, I haven't found him yet. 
I have to go to dinner tonight|with my mother and Phoebe. 
And my mother has requested that you join us. 
She...likes you. 
Uhh! No way. 
She's not asking. 
She's telling. 
Please. 
And try to get her to like Phoebe. 
Just a little, okay? 
You owe me. 
Okay, fine. But I want a lobster. 
Okay. 
I want two lobsters! 
Totaling five pounds of lobster meat. 
And then after that, we can clean|the dead birds out of the chimney. 
That's why we bought these metal rods. 
Don't you just love spring? 
Baltimore was amazing. 
You know Wacky Willy,|that DJ from 102.7? 
We totally did it in the prize van. 
I'll pretty much do anything|to someone that's famous. 
What's up? 
What are you looking at? 
I'll tell you what you're looking at. 
I'm... 
Gordon Tremeshko. 
I always thought it would be lovely|to get married in the spring. 
Just as the petunias start to bloom. 
Sorry, Phoebe, what? 
I always wanted to marry in the spring. 
Just as the petunias bloom. 
Just when the what? 
Oh, dear. Is she hard of hearing? 
No, no, no, no! 
I can hear you. 
I just wanted to make sure|you could hear you. 
Right. 
I'm off to the loo. 
Loo! What a good idea. 
All right. 
Scout's honor. 
What do you think of her? 
She's very well-read. 
And she's very stylish,|don't you think? 
And, you know, the most important thing|is she makes Jack very happy. 
She's like a...white geisha. 
A white geisha? 
Say no more, shark eyes. 
Jack... 
I want you to face facts. 
All right? 
She is not the right girl for you. 
You got it wrong with "Bianka." 
You remember? 
And now you're getting|it wrong with what's-her-name. 
Well, you oughta know, Colleen. 
The only marriage in the history|of St. Helen's Catholic Church 
where the priest recommended the divorce! 
And it's not "Bi-anka," like Sanka. 
It's "Bi-ahnca," like Willy Won--Wonka. 
Are you all right? 
Could we order dessert? 
Studio 6-H. 
Kenneth! You have to come get me! 
Really? 
But what about the Black Crusaders? 
I don't care what they do to me anymore. 
I'd rather die famous|than to live for 100 years like this. 
Licking pinecones, carrying plastic bags. 
Brushing my own teeth. This is unsuitable! 
Mr. Jordan, if you're serious,|then we've got less than 24 hours. 
The show needs you. 
What are ya doin'? 
Hey, dude! Jesse! 
Hey, listen,|I gotta get out of here because... 
You're not goin' anywhere. 
And that phone is for local calls only! 
Aah! 
Hello? 
Did you have a chance to look at|those silk samples I brought you? 
No. 
Jack, you desperately need new pajamas. 
They do such beautiful things. 
It's like wearing your own skin to bed. 
That sounds wonderful. 
Have you ever thought about|a fair finish for that ceiling? 
Shh. 
Careful, my bones! 
You all right? 
Well, with your condition,|ordinarily, wouldn't you just be on top? 
I can't. 
I have vertigo. 
It's a bloody shame nobody waits|for their wedding night anymore! 
Go to bed, Mother! 
You promised you'd go over my taxes! 
Oh, God's sake. 
Here it comes. The big one. 
Ride it, Donaghy. 
Ride it straight to hell! 
Bollocks. 
You still at work, ha? 
Yeah, of course. 
Tracy's gone. I'm still at work. 
It's a nightmare. 
Ugh! Is that how far apart my eyes are? 
I look like Admiral Akbar. 
Relax. 
It's one of the reasons I like you. 
So listen, I was going|to fly out there on Saturday. 
But I've got a bunch of stuff|to take care of. 
So now I'm gonna fly out there. 
I'm gonna come out there next Wednesday. 
Oh, wh-what's this thing doing now? 
What? Uh-oh. 
Yeah, Liz--working. 
Breaking up. 
Did you say we're breaking up? 
Yeah. 
What? 
Who is this? It's 3:00 in the morning. 
 Hello?| Liz... Wait. 
What? Oh, my God. 
Are you breaking up with me? 
 What hospital?| Wait, whoa, Liz... 
No, no, no. 
There has to be some|sort of misunderstanding. 
I'm his fianc�e. 
I'm sorry, you're not family,|and you're not his emergency contact. 
Oh! 
Now, his mother can go in if she wants to. 
Oh, no! I'm not going in there. 
I go in there, I get bird flu,|I don't come out. 
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon. 
Somebody called me. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Donaghy designated you|as his emergency contact. 
What? 
Ladies! 
What? This? 
No, no. 
I was at a costume party|earlier this evening. 
And the hostess's dog attacked me,|so I had to stab it. 
Oh! 
Jack's going to be fine. 
But he has had a pretty|serious cardiac episode. 
Also, I suspect he may have scurvy,|because he keeps asking for lemon. 
Uh, no... that's me. 
Oh! 
Tell him his mother's here! 
And she loves him. 
But not in a queer way. 
Lemon, is that you? 
Yeah, it's me. 
How are you feeling? 
They gave me something. 
My mouth tastes like purple. 
Okay. 
I saw it, Lemon. 
My whole life passing right before my eyes. 
Neil Patterson pitching me|the rotating microwave tray. 
Me personally coining the phrase,|"What's the upside?" 
Participating in Hands Across America. 
And all the time I've been on this earth,|I have only one regret. 
I should have worked more. 
That's what you're taking away|from this experience? 
Work is the only thing I'm good at. 
Lemon, you and I have that in common. 
No, Jack, that's not true. 
I've been rolling calls from here. 
Trying to spin this Tracy thing. 
No, Jack, forget about Tracy. 
You have to relax. 
No, no, no, no, no, no. 
You've got to get back to work and come up with something|with or without Tracy, or we are gonna be screwed. 
Okay. 
Maybe this is the drugs talking... 
but I think I got Nixon... 
to agree to come on the show and say, "Sock it to me." 
Great. 
How's the Dow doing? 
You'll like my cousin Jesse. 
He's real sweet. 
Ooh, they got a door!|That's new. 
Hello there, cousin. 
What brings you to Parcell Hollow? 
Well, I'm here to pick up Tracy, of course. 
Well, that's peculiar. 
Why, he just left first thing this morning. 
(Kenny) Oh. 
Oh, I must have misunderstood him. 
Must have. 
Sorry you came all this way for nothin'. 
I'd invite you in, but I got a living|room full of dead chimney birds. 
Agh! 
Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
We must rest, my chimney bird. 
Tonight, we're reading my screenplay. 
I just timed the show, and without Tracy,|we're still 20 minutes short. 
Liz, on the show, I could do the thing|where I walk like Robocop. 
Zzz! Zzz! Your move, creep. 
That's great, that's completely topical. 
Ooh, hey, Cerie. 
Would you like to dance in front of|the band on TV tonight? 
For, like, ten minutes. 
What band? 
Our house band. 
No, thanks. Uh, Floyd called. 
Ugh. 
How's that going? 
Not great. 
We had a web chat last night, and I thought|he said he wanted to break up with me. 
Oh, that must have freaked you out. 
Actually, I was kind of relieved. 
Hey, guys. 
I hear you're looking for someone|to dance in front of the band. 
 Uh...no.| Uh...no. 
Oh. Isn't this exciting? 
Everyone pulling together. 
I think the show's gonna|be really good this week. 
Oh, I hope Tray's okay. 
Ohh, Floyd. 
Tracy! Time for lunch. 
I hope you like chicken neck Tracy has escaped. 
Thanks, Kenny, for saving me! 
I'll have you in New York|in time for your traditional pre-show rant! 
I think it's gonna be about immigration! 
By the hammer of Thor! 
(Tracy) Now go! Go, go, go! 
I'm gonna find you! 
I know what you look--|I remember what you look like! 
You're so stupid! 
I gotta reload!|Damn, I wish I had a vehicle! 
Jack, I'm filling out all-new paperwork|to make me your emergency contact. 
Of course, Phoebe. You should. 
I mean, it's just so embarrassing. 
Mr. Donaghy. 
You want dessert? 
Good God, yes. 
Uh, let me ask you a few questions, Jack. 
You dye your hair? 
No, Mother.|Why would I do that? 
Okay. What's your middle name? 
What? Just your middle name! 
Francis. 
Did you take $20 out of my pocketbook|in the summer of 1970? 
No, I did not! 
Do you love me? 
Of course I do! 
I knew it. 
Do you love me? 
I see. 
God! 
They got pretzels downstairs! 
Ohh! 
We're so close, and yet so far. 
Come on! 
Hey, do you guys know|what's causing the traffic problem? 
Yeah, the president's in town.|There's a transit strike. 
There's the Dominican Independence Day parade. 
A guy in suspenders is doing|chalk paintings down on Canal Street. 
You know how long it's gonna|take for me to get to Midtown? 
Without sirens? Hours. 
Hey, I need you to take me. 
Let me explain ambulances to you, sir. 
Uh, we don't go anywhere|unless someone is badly hurt, okay? 
But I'm gonna miss the show! 
Mr. Jordan... 
No, sir, you are not. 
Ken, you are my boy! 
Oh, my God, what a terrible mistake accident! 
Could you take Sixth Avenue, please? 
If I die, will you take care of my birds? 
I got a lot on my plate right now, Ken. 
Ohh, Tweetie. 
Okay, I know this has been|a really tough couple of days. 
But everyone has pulled together,|and I am so proud and so pumped. 
Because I honestly think that this might be|the best show we have ever done. 
I'm back! 
Oh, thank God.|We were so screwed! 
Tracy, you're alive. 
Okay, Robocop out! 
Cowboy Hey Hey back in! 
Liz Lemon, I would like|to recommend Kenneth the page for NBC Medal of Excellence. 
Okay, that doesn't exist. 
But you can write a letter for his file. 
I got a lot on my plate! 
Fine, but... 
Les, don't just stand there. 
Go...eat something! 
Wait...I don't know what this is. 
Oh, don't worry about it. 
Just read the cards|and act super-gay! 
Okay. 
Take this, Black Crusaders! 
It's Cowboy Hey Hey! 
This is 21. 
I'm on it. 
Good night! That's our show! 
Have a great summer, everybody! 
Mwah! 
So I'm your emergency contact, huh? 
You're the only person I know|who wouldn't hesitate to pull the plug. 
So when you going to Cleveland? 
I'm not going. 
Are you getting married in two days? 
Oh, Phoebe is a lovely girl. 
But...no. 
I'm not getting married. 
So what'd you think of the show? 
Honestly? 
I no longer think|you're doing a terrible job. 
And, uh, I'm very proud of you. 
Thanks, Jack. 
I'm gonna pull the plug now. 
Whoa, whoa. 
Just let me do it! 
Subs by Traff and Raceman Why is there hair everywhere? 
Did you shave in the kitchen? 
The water in here is softer. 
Look at this ski-jumping idiot, Bode Miller. 
What kind of a fruity name is Bode? 
That cereal has the Olympics on it? 
It must be eight months old. 
When you and me have kids, we're gonna give them good names, like Shannon or Rick. 
When we what? 
When we have kids, dummy. Come on. 
Yeah, I gotta go. Uh... 
Are you gonna be home later? 
I gotta talk to you about something. 
I'll be right here. 
Look at this maze. It's so easy. 
You have to go in here, and out there. 
Be home early, okay? 
Come here, sweetheart. 
Oh, Dennis. 
I just did my hair. 
Oh, that's my girl. 
There you go. 
Bye. 
Now make sure you drink plenty of fluids, and get something to eat. 
Don't do anything strenuous tonight. 
Don't hit the clubs. 
No, I'm going straight home, actually. 
I'm breaking up with my boyfriend tonight. 
I can't take it anymore. 
Hmm, 35, single, no children. 
Three sexual partners in the last ten years. 
I don't know, doll. 
Maybe it's time to settle. 
Chocolate chip, or butter crunch? 
(Jenna) I can't believe that this is happening to me. 
It's just not fair. 
(Pete) You're right. 
This business is unfair. 
What happened? 
Jenna was supposed to be on the Conan show tonight, but... 
I got bumped. 
Oh, you know, that kind of thing happens. 
Jack bumped her and put Tracy on instead. 
Jenna, you can't let this kind of thing get to you. 
I just feel like everything always gets taken away from me. 
No, that's not true. 
What about that movie you did last summer? 
"The Rural Juror"? 
Yeah, The Rur That one. 
Rural Juror, apple three, take one. Mark! 
A terrible title. Action! 
When does that come out? 
"The Rural Juror" opens in selected theaters December 18th. 
Does Jack Donaghy even know I'm in The Rural Juror? 
Maybe if he knew I have a film career, he would treat me with more respect. 
/Jenna to the set, please. 
/Jenna to the set for /Rodney Stink Confirmed Bachelor. 
I will tell him. 
I will tell him that you are in a feature film called The Rrr Jrr. 
What the hell's her movie called? 
I don't know. 
She's been talking about it for a year. 
I can't ask her now. 
I can't believe Jack did this to her. 
I can't believe Conan's gonna have Tracy on as a guest again, considering what happened the last time. 
You seem like you have a nice chemistry... 
I am a stabbing robot. 
I will stab you. 
Oh, jeez. All right, no, okay. 
All right, all right. 
That's great, Tracy. 
We'll take a break. 
We'll be right back. 
Hey, Clariss, can I see Josh's Stone Phillips wig? 
Oh, great. 
Do you mind if I pop it on you, actually? 
I want to see the shape of it. 
Please, it would make my wife's dream come true. 
Oh. Yeah? 
Handsome? 
Yes. 
 You find me handsome? 
 Yes, very much. 
You know, I used to be very rich. 
Hello. 
Oh, hi. Sorry. 
I know you're wearing that as a joke, but it makes you look younger, and more confident, and I think you should consider it. 
Can I see you in my office? 
Yeah, hang on a second, actually. 
Why did you bump Jenna from Conan? 
Because if I have a choice between an international movie star, and a woman who does commercials for ShopRite No, no, no. 
Jenna doesn't do those commercials anymore. 
She got fired. 
I don't do these things just to drive you crazy, Lemon. 
I do them for the good of the show. 
I'm the one that always has to clean up the mess afterwards. 
That's why my job is way better than yours. 
/Way better. 
Conan. 
Tracy's really excited to be back on your show. 
I don't know, Jack. 
He's kind of a loose cannon, and I like to surround myself with people that don't try to stab me. 
Tracy's feeling a lot better now. 
He's under a doctor's care. 
That's what they said about Hasselhoff, then he tried to make out with me during a commercial break. 
Conan, this is important to me.  
So we can either do this the easy way, or the hard way. 
What's the hard way? 
You do a live Christmas Eve special from Kabul every year until the war on terror is won. 
Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight. 
You, black Irish bastard. 
Back at you, man. 
I have to be charming on Conan tonight. 
This is my chance to redeem myself with mainstream America. 
Okay, well just tell us some things about your life, and we'll try to punch it up and make it talk show-worthy. 
Maybe something about you and your wife. 
Me  and my wife like to play "rape." 
She go in the bathroom and do her hair. 
 Then I put on a ski mask... 
 Okay, not that. 
Hey, uh, you got anything about being a dad? 
People eat that garbage up. 
I like to walk around my house naked, to remind my oldest son who's still got the biggest ding dong. 
No. 
I can tell the story of how I met Sharon Stone. 
Oh, what was that? 
I was pooping in the ladies' room at the Ivy... 
No. 
My hair hurts. 
Anybody gonna answer the phone? 
What phone? 
Is anybody gonna answer the phone? The phone! 
It's ringing! 
Ring! Ring! 
So you wanted to see me? 
Oh, Lemon, wonderful. 
I'm introducing Jack Welch with a dinner at the Waldorf. 
What's a funny little quip I could open with? 
That's why you called me up here? 
Okay. 
Uh... "Good evening. 
It's great to be here at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria. 
"I haven't seen this many white people in tuxedoes since the Titanic." 
Lemon, this is not open mike night at the Bryn Mawr student union. 
This is a $1,000 a plate fund raiser. 
Okay, uh... 
How about, "Wow, $1,000 a plate. 
"For that kind of money this stuffed chicken breast better paint my house." 
Let me tell you what I was thinking of saying. 
"Jack Welch has such unparalleled management skills, they named Welch's grape juice after him. 
"Because he squeezes the sweetest juice out of his workers' mind grapes." 
That doesn't even make sense. 
No, it doesn't, does it? 
I wrote it down in the middle of the night. 
Listen, I'll try to come up with something for you, but I gotta get back downstairs. 
Lizzie  needs help. 
Cookie in the middle of the day? 
I gave blood. 
Does that burn calories? 
What else? 
What else is on my mind grapes? 
I could talk about how the moon is a spy satellite put there by Oprah and minister Farrakhan. 
And not the minister Farrakhan you're thinking of. 
Who's that dude? 
Uh, what dude? 
The blue dude. 
Tell him to stop staring at me. 
I don't like that dude. 
I don't like that dude. 
Meep. 
Hey, guys. 
That was weird. 
Hi. 
You missed it. 
Tracy was acting old-school bananas. 
He's always bananas. 
No, this was different. 
Yeah. Like Conan-should-be-afraid different. 
Really? 
Where did he go? 
Yes. I am having problems 
with my cable television. 
Yes, I will hold. 
Excuse me, I have another call. 
Hi, mom. I am doing fine. 
Oh, that's not good. 
Frank, that was my blood cookie. 
Ew, what? 
Hey, Jack Attack. 
Sorry, I should have kept that one in the old brain box. 
Could you sign that for me, please? 
Pete, where is your charisma? 
What? 
The wig. 
I prefer that you wear it. 
Well, I thought you were joking. 
Well, let me clarify: I'm not joking. 
Pete, did you know that men with full heads of hair on average earn 17% more than their bald counterparts? 
I did not know that. 
Perhaps it's because bald men are generally less informed than men with full heads of hair. 
But here's what I want you to do. 
Wear the wig for a week. 
And experience your full potential. 
I think this is my full potential. 
I know you're skeptical, Pete, I know. 
Here, I want you to do something. 
Pull my hair. 
Right now, go ahead. 
Pull my hair. 
I'm just kidding. 
It's real. 
I'm not like you. 
So, be honest with me. 
What did Jack say? 
I guess he thinks that Tracy is a movie star. 
And he doesn't love it that you did those commercials. 
Well, you tell him that those commercials paid for my vacation home. 
So, unless he would like to buy me a condo in Clearwater, Florida... 
Jenna, I'm sorry. 
Just let it go. 
Tracy's doing Conan tonight. 
Liz Lemon, we got a problem. 
Grizz and Dotcom say Tracy's doctor put him on some new medication. 
I guess he's having some sort of reaction. 
Boy, Conan tapes in... 
Less than two hours. 
Call me if you need me. 
Tray? Can I come in? 
I'm bugging out! 
I'm bugging out. 
I'm bugging out! 
Tracy! 
Who is your doctor? 
Dr. Spaceman! 
Dr. Spaceman! 
Oh, brother. Look around. 
We have to find his medication. 
Dr. Spaceman. 
Dr. Spaceman. 
Wow, Dr. Spaceman. 
I owe you an apology, Tray. 
This is Dr. Leo Spa-che-men. 
Hi,  I work with Tracy Jordan, and I think he's having a reaction to some of the medication you put him on. 
Ah, I was afraid this might happen. 
You know, he's on so many different neuroleptics, and tricyclics, that there's no telling how they'll mix. 
But what can you do? 
Medicine's not a science. 
What exactly are you treating him for? 
/There's not really a name for what Tracy has. 
Basically it's erratic tendencies, and delusions, brought on by excessive notoriety. 
And certainly not helped by my wildly experimental treatments. 
Boy, I'm being awfully open with you, miss. 
I should not have taken those blue things. 
So, is he dangerous? 
/No, he should be fine, so long as you keep him away from bright lights, loud music and crowds. 
I'll call in a prescription for something to settle him down, as soon as possible. 
Uh...do you need anything for yourself? 
What? No. 
Just, where can I pick up Tracy's prescription? 
Ms. Lemon, they need you upstairs 
in Mr. Donaghy's office immediately. 
Kenneth, I need you to go to RiteDrug, 46th and 8th, pick up Tracy's medicine fast, okay? 
Yes, sir. 
What is it? 
What's the emergency? 
How's this for an opening line? 
When I first met Jack Welch, I thought he was such a great golfer, he made Bob Darnell look like Randy Barnes. 
That's fine. Do that. 
I don't know. 
Might be distasteful if Randy's widow's in the audience. 
What did you come up with? 
I have a bigger problem, Jack. 
I don't think Tracy's ready to do Conan. 
I think you should let Jenna do it, and maybe Tracy could do it in a couple of weeks. 
Jenna's not a star. 
She's capable, but she's not a star. 
She's got a movie coming out next month. 
What movie? 
"The Rrr Jrr." 
The what? 
Tracy's acting nuts.  
He's having problems with his medication. 
Did you call Dr. Spa-che-men? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Then he'll be fine. 
Leo's an excellent physician. 
And a pretty good dentist. 
Is that rehearsal? 
Oh no--Oh! 
No, this Tracy situation is really... 
Are we still talking about that? 
Do I have to come in and run your show? 
Or could you take this one thing off my plate? 
No,  I got it. 
I'll figure it out. 
 What? 
 Don't ask. 
Who is this leader of men? 
What can I do for you, handsome? 
Liz... 
I wanted you to be the first to know. 
After the way Jack treated me today, I can't work here anymore. I quit. 
Oh, Jenna, I really don't have time for this. 
Then, I guess this is goodbye. 
Okay. Jenna don't quit. 
The show can't go on without you. 
You're my muse, you're a modern-day Lucille Ball. 
You're prettier than Deborah Messing. 
Please don't quit. 
Well, if that's the way you feel, I'll stay. Okay. 
Oh, it's Dennis. Oh. 
Do you have any food? 
I'm getting really low blood sugar. 
Are you dieting finally? 
What are you doing? 
South Beach, Master Cleanse? 
Hello? 
Whoa, gimme, gimme. Shoo. 
Liz, hey. 
It's me, Dennis. 
Dennis, what do you want? 
(Dennis on the phone) Do me a huge favor. 
Call Ticketmaster right away. 
Nickleback just added another date, right? 
I would do it on your computer, but I'm downloading a game right now. 
No, I can't do that for you. 
Just be home tonight when I get there, okay? 
I need to talk to you about something. 
Word. 
(Tracy) Blue man! 
That blue dude keeps following me! 
Meek, eep. 
All right, let's get him down to Conan's hair and make-up and hopefully Kenneth will be back any minute. 
Oh, my. 
(Tracy) No! No! Agh! 
No! No! 
The blue man is runnin' up on me. 
There's no blue man. 
I can't take the blue man. 
I don't want the blue man. 
All right, all right. 
Hey, Liz. 
What's up? 
Oh, hi, Conan. 
How are you? 
Good. 
You still going out with that guy from the pager store? 
Who, Dennis? 
Yeah. 
You still, um... 
How's your wife? 
Let's not do this, Elizabeth. 
Okay. 
(Tracy) Nyah, nyah, nyah. 
Nah! 
Vocal warm-ups. 
I'll tell him you came by. 
Okay. 
Whoa, he licked all of those. 
After you, ma'am. 
(Liz) Chewbacca, may I speak to Tracy, please? 
How's it going? 
No! 
Past Pete is here to kill Future Pete! 
It's going great. 
No! 
(Liz) It's all right, Tracy. Come back. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Do you have a prescription  for Mr. Tracy Jordan? 
(Liz) Come on out of there, buddy. 
Oh, I almost forgot. 
Jack would like to see you up in his office. 
Oh, I don't have time for this. 
Yes, Jonathan tell him I've got my hands full with Tracy. 
You sound upset. 
(Liz) I am upset. 
Come on up and we'll talk about it. 
Fine. I will try the other location. 
But frankly, LaDonica, you have not been real helpful. 
We'll get to your problem in a minute. 
Have you had a chance to think of my zinger? 
"Well, it's almost Thanksgiving, everybody. 
"And I know what this crowd's giving thanks for. 
Estate tax reform." 
That is terrific. 
I really enjoyed that. 
But, do you think it's too topical? 
Damn, I wish this event were tonight. 
It's not tonight? 
When is it? 
February. 
Why are you wearing a tux? 
It's after 6:00. 
What am I, a farmer? 
It's 6:00. 
You are right after this commercial, Mr. Jordan. 
You can do this. 
Mr. Blue man. 
You're gonna tell me my feet stink? 
You don't even have feet. Blue man! 
Blue man, where your feet at? 
(woman) This is home to Late Night with Conan O'Brien. 
That's right. 
Now we are on the... 
I'm sorry. Excuse me. 
This is a page coming through. 
I'm sorry. 
Let me just... 
(Pete) Let him through! 
No. Please. 
Here it is! 
No. 
Pete! I'm trying. 
Give me his pills! 
Here. 
They're from Dr. Spaceman. 
(Conan) ...my first guest tonight 
from his numerous hit releases including "President Homeboy" and "Honky Grandma Be Tripping." 
Or you may know him from his last appearance on this show, when he tried to stab me in the face. 
(Stage manager) Gotta go! Excuse me. 
Tracy. 
(Conan) Please welcome Tracy Jordan. 
You know, you really went above and beyond for that guy today. 
I just hope we get away with it. 
This is going on a little long.  
Don't, don't. 
Don't do that. 
Pants on. Pants on. 
Sit in the chair, buddy. 
Sit in the chair. Sit down. 
Sit. Oh! 
Sit down! 
That a boy. 
(Conan)  Good to have you here. 
That was great, and you're And he's asleep. 
Which...is okay, 'cause at least 
he didn't murder me. 
(Conan) We'll take a break, and... 
Tracy Jordan, everybody! 
Hey, you did good, kid. 
Give me that. 
I really gotta eat something. 
I've lost track of it! 
Hey. 
Hey. What's up? 
I didn't know what you wanted, so I ordered you a cheeseburger. 
Oh, Dennis. Thank you. 
Oh, thank you, thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
So what did you want to talk to me about, huh? 
Nothing. I forget. 
I just want to listen to you play Halo 'til I fall asleep. 
Ah, that's baloney! 
How did the grenade not kill him? 
He was standing right next to it. 
You know what, Liz? 
This controller's defective. 
Liz? 
Well, I got started in the NBC page program. 
And before you know it, I'm making hit movies with my good friend, and roommate, Zach Braff. 
What? 
Who told you that? 
Well, yes. 
I do know how to clog. 
But I don't think anybody wants to see me do that. 
You do? Really? 
Okay. 
You're a weird guy, Kenneth. 
See you tomorrow, Mr. O'Brien. 
That's a wrap. 
Monday's call time is 9:00 AM. 
Good show, Liz Lemon! 
You coming to the after-after party. 
We have after-after parties? 
Hey, I'm Steven! 
Hi, Sven! 
I'm Liz. 
Yo, Lemon! 
You comin' to the after-after-after party? 
Sure. 
I'm Tracy's new business manager. 
He gave me tickets to see the show. 
Oh, cool. 
Let's blow this joint! 
It's about to turn back into a taxi dispatch center. 
You going to the after-after-after-after party? 
Okay. 
Well, let's rock. 
212, 555 Don't go, Liz Lemon! 
There's still a afterafter after-after-after-party! 
I just gotta take my kids to soccer first. 
The inaugural vintage. 
"Donaghy Estates?" 
It's from that vineyard on the north fork of Long Island that I bought. 
I told you about that. 
No, you didn't. 
Oh... 
Must've been Angie Harmon. 
Boy, I'm really excited about this. 
After 20 years of working for big companies, I finally have my own name on something. 
I know what you mean. 
When I was eight, I had my name on the score board at a Phillies game. 
And they spelled it "Lez" but it was pretty cool. 
Well, this ought to prove my mother wrong, saying that Donaghy is Gaelic for "failure." 
Huh, what the hell does she know? 
She's a Murphy. 
Bunch of mud farmers and sheep rapists. 
Well, congratulations. 
Yes. 
Umm. 
Oh, I'm gonna vomit! 
What the hell am I gonna do? 
I've got 10,000 cases of this crap. 
Hey, am I interrupting? 
No. 
Hey, Steven... 
How are things going with Tracy? 
I'm making progress on his IRS problems. 
You two know each other? 
Well, I referred Tracy to Steven, who's an executive vice president at the investment firm of Dewey, Cheatham, and Livingston. 
I just swung by to see if we were still on for tonight. 
Oh, yeah, of course. 
Good. 
See you tonight. 
Well, well, well, Lemon! 
Steven's a good man. 
He's on partner track at Dewey. 
And he's a Black. 
A black? 
That is offensive. 
No, no That's his last name. 
Steven Black. 
Good family. 
Oh, yeah, of course. 
Remarkable people, the Blacks. 
Musical, very athletic. 
Not very good swimmers. 
Again, I'm talking about the family. 
Black is African American though. 
Well, I don't care about that. 
Well, I know that is the type of thing we tell ourselves, but trust me. 
When I was dating Condoleezza, there were genuine cultural tensions. 
I mean, we would go to the movies, and she would yell at the screen. 
I don't even notice those kind of things. 
You know, when I leave work at night, I am just riding on a subway car full of scary, teenaged people. 
Mr. Jordan, I have a message 
for you from a Mr. Ridikolus. 
Ridikolus the hip-hop producer? 
Isn't that the guy that bit Suge Knight? 
Yeah, yeah He bit Suge Knight. 
Held Raven Simone over a balcony. 
Made Rasheed Wallace cry. 
Dude is crazy! 
I don't want him calling me. 
Oh, he didn't call, Mr. Jordan. 
He gave me the message after I wouldn't let him into your party the other night. 
What? 
I'll call you when I get it I'm sorry, this is a private party. 
Hold on. 
We're with Tracy Jordan. 
And Mr. Jordan himself said, 
"Don't let no one in who's not on the list "'Cause this mess is gonna get raw like sushi, so haters to the left." 
Hey! 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. 
What's your game, man? 
Boggle. 
Come on, come on. 
But you know what? 
You tell Tracy Jordan that Ridikolus... 
"Is gonna eat his family." 
Excuse me, won't you? 
Oh, hey! 
Oh... 
I'm sorry Who died? 
Nobody. 
I have a date. 
Really? 
With that guy that sent you the flowers? 
By mistake? 
No, that guy has a girlfriend. 
Technicality. 
Although, I did see flower guy recently. 
And it was pretty excellent. 
 Hey, Liz Lemon. 
 Hey, workout flower guy. 
Whattaya got there? 
The old leather pumpkin? 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
What? 
I was just saying, um... 
You got the old leather pumpkin. 
Ugh. 
But he's taken, so I'm gonna go out with this guy Steven that I met at the after party. 
Oh, that cute black guy? 
Why am I the only person that doesn't care that he's black? 
Race is a huge issue in this country, according to Newsweek magazine. 
Well, it's 2007 and some of us don't have those hang-ups. 
And good morning to you, sir. 
Come on in, Lemon. 
Tracy, what seems to be the problem. 
Tracy who? 
You're lookin' at a ghost, JD. 
Dead Man Walking, The Green Mile, Christmas With the Klumps. 
Is this about Ridikolus? 
Because I think you're overreacting. 
Look, I am old school. 
Growing up, when you were mad at somebody, you would just break dance at 'em. 
I'm talking about break hard, pull it back pop, boom, boom Into gladiator Bring it back down. 
Yeah, I'm familiar with break dancing. 
Okay. 
Worm it out. 
And then pop! 
Boom! 
Now brothers just shoot you! 
Oh, no, no Look Ridikolus is the biggest hip-hop producer in New York City, and he was disrespected at my party! 
This may be a great opportunity. 
For what? 
To unload some of this awful wine. 
Tracy, for years, Cristal was the hip-hop champagne, until the president of Roederer committed a fateful error. 
Cristal has since been boycotted in the rap community, creating a vacuum which could be filled by Donaghy Estates sparkling wine. 
Which, according to this lab report, "contains no lead and is not fatal if swallowed." 
Mm. 
If you get rich off of this stuff, just take care of my family. 
I don't want my kids to have to go to college. 
Tracy, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. 
You have my word. 
To success. 
Is that a piece of corn in there? 
So, uh, you like comedy. 
Mm-hmm. 
Have you heard of Mark Russell? 
Yeah, that's the guy that plays the ragtime songs about politics. 
Yes! He's wonderful. 
He has this one You better watch out. 
Don't make a flap. 
'Cause Hilary's wearing a Yankees cap. 
Oh boy, are you singing? 
Yes! 
It's just so funny. 
So, how about Lost this season? 
Sorry, I don't own a TV. 
Really? 
What do you sit and look at? 
I have hobbies. 
I participate in Vietnam war reenactments. 
And I take pictures of interesting doors. 
And I spend a lot of free time blogging about Star Wars. 
Oh, really? 
You like Star Wars? 
I love it. 
I was Princess Leia, like, four Halloweens in a row... 
Recently. 
No no no no Not the fantasy movie with the, uh, monsters. 
I'm talking about the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
Yeah, we should probably go ahead and order. 
This Porterhouse for two looks good. 
I'm just gonna get a salad. 
I really don't care about food. 
And yet no brand has emerged to fill that market gap at present. 
There is no club drink. 
That's where Donaghy Estates comes in. 
Now, as you may have read in Robert Parker's wine newsletter, "Donaghy Estates tastes like "the urine of Satan after a hefty portion of asparagus." 
But this is not a question of taste. 
Sure. 
I mean, it's about branding, it's about perception. 
Exactly, and the ideal opportunity to launch a new drink label is right around the corner: The Source Awards. 
Well, I'm producing the Source Awards. 
And I would like Donaghy Estates to be your corporate sponsor. 
You ever have more money than you could shake a stick at? 
Well, pick out a stick. 
'Cause Ridikolus is gonna be drinking Donaghy Estates tonight. 
Excellent. 
Now, I also hope this means you'll set aside your problem with my friend Tracy Jordan. 
No, I don't think I could let that go that easy. 
What if he makes it up to you? 
Who's hosting the Source Awards? 
What about Tracy? 
Hey, Matthew, you want some juicy office gossip? 
They're closing the C-bank elevators for maintenance. 
Wow, that would've been a great way to shoot Tracy. 
Well, maybe next time. 
We're you gentlemen not given visitors' badges, Or did you all just not feel like wearing them. 
Jack, what's up with your man? 
This is just our Kenneth. 
How's it going, Kenneth? 
He's very unstable. 
Eh, did you get that at a cane shop? 
So then Zoolander goes, "Mm." 
Yeah, I've seen the movie. 
Yeah, but when you see it on an airplane, they take out all the swears and stuff, and it makes it so much funnier, I think. 
Ah, gracias. 
Wow, this has been so much fun. 
We should do this again. 
Oh, yeah... sure. 
The night's young. 
We should take a carriage ride around the financial district. 
Okay, Steven you're obviously a really nice guy. 
But I just don't think we're a good match. 
Yeah, I know. 
I get it. 
It's because I'm black. 
What? 
I said I get it. 
You don't like me, because I am black! 
You think I'm racist? 
That is just nasty, negative What did you call me under your breath? 
Nothing! 
I am not racist. 
I love black men! 
I love you! 
This is fantastic. 
Let's get dessert. 
Death by Chocolate. 
No, no-- not that kind of chocolate. 
Steven played the race card? 
Yes! 
What did you do? 
What could I do? 
I picked up the check and I made out with him a little bit in the taxi. 
Maybe if I just hang out with him four or five more teams, he'll see on his own that we are a bad match. 
Why do you do this to yourself? 
If you don't like him, end it. 
Who cares if he thinks you're a racist. 
I do because I'm not! 
Ah, than Ahman-da. 
It's Amanda. 
What are you gonna do? 
...Tom Cruise, 'cause that's how 
Oprah says it. 
"Tom!" 
 That's good; sounds like her. 
Tracy, good news. 
I think I solved your problem with Ridikolus. 
For real, Jack? 
All you have to do is agree to host the Source Awards on Saturday. 
The Source Awards? 
No no no no no! 
What's the problem? 
Death sentence number two. 
Shooting people at the Source Awards is a tradition. 
It's like Christmas. 
Or shooting people outside of Hot 97. 
Tracy, don't worry. 
Ridikolus and I are in business together now. 
And business heals all wounds. 
I mean, look at our relationship with Germany or Japan. 
Who could even remember what all the fuss was about? 
It's not about Ridikolus. 
Who else is gonna be at this thing? 
Well, you're gonna be sharing the stage with Nas. 
Nope! He hates me! 
We used to date the same girl. 
What about Young Jeezy? 
Forget about it. 
I called his pitbull a gaywad on 106 & Park. 
That would do it. 
The Game? 
Nope. 
TI? 
Ain't nothin' happening. 
Superhead? 
No can do. 
Fabolus? 
Won't do. 
Rindonkeykong? 
No! 
MC Scatcat? 
What? 
Homunculus? 
Mm-mm. 
Raw Dog? 
Hell no! 
Me and his beef go way back. 
We were both cast members on a Nickelodeon show called Ray Ray's Mystery Garage. 
 Brush your teeth  Brush your teeth  When it's time for bed  You gotta brush your teeth Hey, chump You scuffed my sneakers! 
Dr. J wears these! 
I'm sorry, man I'm pretty drunk. 
You know what? 
I'm gonna eat your family! 
Tracy, if it will make you feel any more comfortable, I'd be happy to loan you a handgun. 
What? 
Oh, Mother I forgot you were there. 
No, he's not taking a gun. 
Tracy, just tell them you can't go. 
If I don't go, Ridikolus is gonna kill me. 
If I do go, someone else is gonna kill me. 
See, it's a Catch 22! 
Aw, he's gonna be there too. 
God! 
Yo, my Gs, we roll 50 deep In the club, VIP Sippin' on Donaghy 'Cause I can get raw and take names Just like LeBron James And Donaghy kind of rhymes with party Which is cool This is nasty. 
I gots to get outta here. 
I gotta take a break. 
I can't drink any more of this. 
My tummy's killin' me. 
Okay, cut! 
Everybody take five. 
Ghostface, you think you could mention DonaghyEstates.com at any point? 
Okay, Jack. 
I'll go get my rhyming dictionary. 
Tracy hasn't returned any of my calls. 
Do we still have a deal, Jack? 
Don't worry. 
He'll be there. 
What color plane you want to buy? 
Clear... 
like Wonder Woman's. 
You don't realize how beautiful the sunset is till it's the last one you'll ever see. 
Ken. 
I'll be going soon. 
But I just wanted you to know that I've loved being your mentor. 
And it's been an honor having you be my manatee. 
Oh. 
Mr. Jordan, 
I hate seeing you like this. 
What can I do to help you? 
Nothing, Ken. 
I'm just going through the classic stages of grief. 
Fear... 
Denial... 
Horniness... 
Wisdom, sleepiness And now, depression. 
What about anger? 
No, I don't want to do anger! 
You can't make me! 
Now, stop it, Mr. Jordan. 
You need to take some of your own advice. 
Aren't you the man who told me to live every week like it's Shark Week? 
And that nothing's impossible except for dinosaurs. 
Don't give up on life, sir. 
Wow! 
The manatee has become the mento. 
Wow! 
Hey, Steven. 
Can I talk to you? 
Sure, I was just gonna call you. 
Now, I know you like food. 
So I found this really neat Canadian restaurant in Times Square. 
Look, I need you to understand something. 
I don't want to go out with you, and it has nothing to do with your race. 
Okay. 
Steven, listen to me, okay? 
And please believe what I'm saying. 
I truly don't like you as a person. 
Can't one human being not like another human being? 
Can't we all just not get along? 
Liz, I wish it could be like that. 
And maybe someday, our children or our children's children will hate each other like that. 
But it just doesn't work that way today. 
So what you're saying is any woman that doesn't like you is racist. 
No No no no no no... 
Some women are gay. 
Okay How racist is this? 
I'm going to the Source Awards tomorrow night. 
Well, let me get on the black phone and call the NAACP so they could just send you your medal right now. 
Okay, you know what? 
You're going with me as my date. 
And you will see that we don't get along as people. 
Yeah? 
Will there be a gift bag? 
Probably. 
Okay. 
Well, you can have everything in it. 
Because I collect tote bags. 
Tracy, do you think I'm racist? 
No--I think you like to dress black men up as Oprah as part of your effort to protect our dignity. 
O, yeah, when you do that impression, don't forget to stretch everything out. 
"We've got John Travoltaaaa!" 
Tracy, buddy You've got to do this Source Awards thing. 
No, I don't. 
Why not? 
I haven't given up on life yet. 
I have a plan. 
What plan? 
I'm gonna find a homeless man, dress him up like me, set him on fire, then I'm gonna start a brand-new life in Arizona under the new name "Ron Mexico." 
We're not doing that. 
Look, I need you to do me this favor. 
I know you're nervous. 
Why don't we go down to the pistol range, squeeze off a few rounds. 
Let the guns do the worrying. 
Again with the guns! 
What is it with men and guns? 
Well, I think I speak for the both of us when I say because they're metal penises. 
Yeah, well, you can't solve all your problems by shooting someone or setting a stranger on fire. 
Would Oprah do that? 
Lemon does make a good point, Tracy. 
What would Oprah do? 
Would she run away from her community, or would she face her problems head-on and try to make a difference at the Source Awards. 
What would I do, Tracy? 
What would I doooo! 
Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards. 
That's great news. 
Thank you so much. 
That was the lab. 
The monkey died of natural causes, so we're in the clear. 
It's great doing business with you, Jack. 
You too, Ridikolus. 
Mm--Call me Gerald. 
Oh. 
The choice to be excellent begins with the choice to silence your inner critic. 
Embrace your spirit! 
What was that? 
Oprah. 
It was the only way we could get him to come. 
You're all wonders. 
You're all my miracles. 
You're all my children of the corn. 
Hi! 
Good for you! 
Good for you! 
Thank you. 
He's channeling Oprah. 
Why? 
Because he's articulate? 
There is something about you that I just don't like. 
Yeah! 
Hey, can you put my phone in your purse for me? 
I don't want to drop it when I start crumpin'. 
Why do guys always do this? 
Bring your own purse. 
I'm gonna get food. 
Here you go! 
Another case of D.E. 
I actually tried some before. 
It tasted real good, but it make my tongue turn white. 
Hey, do I look sweet to you? 
Do I look like sugar? 
Back away! 
Oh, he's harmless. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
I am Ridikolus. 
And you better be glad that Jack Donaghy has your back. 
Well, I... 
Got your nose! 
Jay, go get my nose back. 
Ladies and gentlemen, your host, Mr. Tracy Jordan. 
Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards. 
Our chance to come together as a community. 
To not only look into our hearts, but to look under our seats! 
Because everyone is getting Vermont maple scooo-oones! 
Oh, man! 
You did not just scuff these shoes. 
P-Diddy wears these. 
Oh, will he be mad when you give them back? 
Son, to have you, your moms must be so stupid she thinks Grape Nuts is an STD. 
Well, sir, your mother must not have raised you right, 'cause you're not saying very nice things. 
Girlfriend, Oprah was right! 
People just want to be together and get free stuff! 
I didn't really have to bring this. 
Oh, my God! 
Tracy! 
How do you get the bullets out of this thing? 
Son of a bitch! 
I was looking for the phone in your purse! 
I wasn't trying to steal anything, you racist! 
It was an accident! 
Good God, Lemon You shot a Black! 
No no no no no It's cool; that's his last name. 
You gotta be kidding me, Donaghy! 
First, Mr. Furley here disrespects me, 
and then she shoots my business manager? 
I got blood on my tote! 
He's got blood on his tote. 
You're making a mockery of the Source awards. 
Wait till I tell Tupac about this. 
I didn't hear anything. 
Good. 
Get him outta here! 
Oh, my bad! 
Subs by Traff and Raceman Well, I don't know why they need you in the studio. 
Surprise! 
Oh, my God! 
Is this for me? 
I can't believe you made all this fuss over my birthday. 
It's so incredibly thoughtful. 
Let me give something back to you guys. 
* I believe the children are our future * * Teach them well and let them lead the way * Hey, guess what, everyone? 
I'm engaged. 
Engaged? 
Hey, this isn't gonna change the way you dress or eat lollipops, is it? 
No. 
Oh, then congratulations. 
This is for you, Cerie. 
* I believe the children are our future * * Teach them well and let them lead the way * * Show them... 
* All the beauty they possess... * 
Everyone, guess what? 
There's an antique car show out in the plaza! 
How long is Jack gonna be? 
He's still on the phone. 
Area code 407? 
Oh, no. 
When did this happen? 
407? Is that bad? 
It's fine. 
It's gonna be just fine. 
Jonathan, these cheap phones keep on shattering! 
You can go in now. 
No. 
Who let 407 through? 
Jonathan, we have drills for this! 
Liz distracted me. 
No, I didn't. 
What's going on? 
Business got you down? 
Business doesn't get me down. 
Business gets me off. 
Now, what is your urgent problem this time? 
Well, the writers and I wanted to get TGS jackets, but the guy in accounting says that we can't have the jackets. 
But Dateline has jackets. 
Jackets? 
Is this what you're talking about now? 
Jackets? 
Lemon, do you realize that your little show accounts for 3% of our revenue but takes up 90% of my time? 
Hello?! 
Now, would you do me a kindness, please? 
And handle your problems yourself and stop bothering me. 
Is that too much to ask? 
Absolutely! 
Forget it. 
I won't bother you about anything anymore. 
Wow, he's a little bit of a stress eater, huh? 
He puts up with so much. 
All right. 
Liz, you shoulda seen this guy at the club last night. 
Everybody at this party is a Jedi. 
We must get our freak on while our fruit is a-plentiful. 
Oh, naw! 
Oh, sounds like another great party I wasn't invited to. 
Tracy, thank you for the funnest night of my life! 
Love you, man. 
I love you too, J Bird! 
Yo, I don't like that dude. 
It's disrespectful when he imitates me. 
I want him fired. 
Oh, come on, it's a goof. 
How would you like it if I did an impression of you, Liz Lemon? 
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon! 
I like to wear man shirts. 
Watch me skateboard. 
I don't skateboard. 
Hurts, doesn't it? 
I'm not firing Josh. 
You always take his side. 
Tracy, stop tasering him. 
See? 
I need to be respected, Liz Lemon. 
What do you know about respect? 
Please, Tracy, just let it go. 
Well, if you won't do anything about it, then I'll just go over your head to Donaghy. 
No, no no, do not do that. 
Don't bother him. 
I'll talk to Josh. 
Hey, Cerie, what are you doing? 
Oh, I let them do my make-up sometimes. 
They say it's fun for them. 
She's like a Barbie. 
Oh, sorry, my babysitter got jury duty. 
I think I'm going to kill myself. 
So, Cerie, how long have you known this guy that you're marrying? 
It'll be two months in... 
three weeks. 
You'd love him, Liz. 
He's so funny. 
He does this thing where he screams at limo drivers. 
Yeah, it just kind of seems like you're rushing into it a little bit. 
I guess. 
But we both wanna have babies while it's still cool. 
I already have all the names picked out. 
If it's a girl, Bookcase. 
Or Sandstorm. Or maybe Hat. 
But that's more of a boy's name. 
Yeah, I was gonna say. 
It's just, you're so young, Cerie. 
There's no big hurry to have babies. 
I mean, there are other things in life.  
Like having a career. And working. 
And...having a job. 
And working. 
You can have a career anytime. 
But you only have a really short period where you can be a young, hot mom. 
If you wait too long, you could be like... 
50 at your kid's graduation. 
50's not that old, Cerie. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Are you 50 now? 
Paul Newman or Robert Redford? 
I've told you 1,000 times, Newman. 
Because  I enjoy his salad dressings and lemonade. 
Me too. 
Okay, uh, Brad Pitt... 
or George Clooney? 
Do you think I'd be a good mother? 
What? 
Something is kicking in. 
And the last few months I've just started wondering if I'm ever gonna have a baby. 
I mean, I'm so many steps away from being able to do it. 
And I panic that maybe I waited too long. 
What if my junk goes bad? 
What if Cerie is right? 
Wow, red wine is not your drink. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm in my right mind. 
I just--it comes in waves, you know? 
And I love my job and I love my friends. 
And if I am meant to crank out a kid, then I have plenty of time. 
Uh, not really. 
Jenna! 
No, Liz, I'm just saying. 
If this is something you really want, let's go for it. 
I'll help you. 
Please, let me help you for once. 
We'll get you a guy. 
Like that hot dancer Madonna used to have Lourdes. 
No no no. 
That is not how I roll. 
Forget I said anything. 
Because you agreed to this. 
I did not make you sign anything. 
I will not be intimidated by you! 
Good morning, Mr. Donaghy! 
Go to hell. 
No, thank you. 
Kenneth, I'm sorry. 
How do you do it, Kenneth? 
How do you sit here every day taking crap from people and you keep smiling? 
My mother always told me that even when things seemed bad... 
there's someone else who's having a worse day. 
Like being stung by a bee or getting a splinter. 
Or being chained to a wall in someone's sex dungeon. 
Isn't that a kick in the soft stuff, Kenneth? 
I  mean, you gain strength from your mother while mine is sucking the life out of me. 
She calls me constantly. That was her. 
That was her. 
Complaining about where she's living. 
Threatening to move in with me. 
Oh, how wonderful. 
No no no, that's not wonderful. 
I run companies. Plural. 
But to that woman... 
I'm always gonna be the punk kid who cried when Pop was run over by a mail truck. 
Oh my, a mailman killed your dad? 
No, Pop was my dog. 
My dad left when I was two... 
so I grew up calling my Collie Pop. 
My mother is my best friend. 
My mother tried to send me to Vietnam to make a man out of me. 
I was 12. 
Well, my mother has her dark times too. 
But that's when I tell her, "Mama, you carried me for nine months. 
Let me carry you now." 
You are a remarkable human being, Kenneth. 
I bought my mother a lovely retirement home. In Florida. 
With a tea garden and fake rocks made of foam because she falls down a lot. 
Got everything she needs except a phone. 
I told those people, I made it clear, do not give her a phone. 
It's her. 
It's always her. 
Hello? 
This is Dr. Leo Spaceman. 
Oh, hi, I'm sorry. 
I got this number under fertility in the Writer's Guild Health Manual. 
I'm also listed under meth addiction and child psychiatry. 
So what can I help you with? 
I should start by saying that I can't personally help you conceive. 
Something happened to me while scuba diving. 
Hey, so Jenna tells us you're looking for a babydaddy. 
She what? 
Yeah. So? 
So... 
Are you kidding me? 
Now, okay, before you say no... 
I just wanna say... 
our child would have a leg up getting into Harvard. 
Oh, really? 
Did you go to Harvard? 
'Cause you haven't mentioned it in like three hours. 
Our kid would have strong, flat feet. 
And if you choose me, I agree not to take my shirt off. 
But I do like to get yelled at during sex. 
You're disgusting. 
Yeah, that's a good start. 
Ugh. 
Get out of here. 
Jenna had no business telling you guys that. 
Oh, hey, blue pages. 
What? What's wrong? 
Jenna told the writers that I'm looking for a guy to get me pregnant. 
Can you believe her? 
I know. 
It's so uncool. 
I mean, why would she go to them? 
Who do you know better than me? 
Oh, come on. 
Didn't you have a vasectomy? 
No, I just told my wife I did. 
And she doesn't get pregnant how? 
I fake it. 
Is Jenna out here? 
Is she rehearsing? 
She's onstage. 
Excuse me, Ms. Lemon? 
Uh... 
I'm not usually this formal, nor this bold, but I figure time is on neither one of our sides. 
Uh, could you excuse us for a second? 
I'd kind of like him to stay. 
Very well. 
Ms. Lemon... Liz... 
I'd like to carry your child if I might. 
I have a small ferret farm about 60 miles north of the city. 
It's not much, but it is self-sufficient. 
I can get cable if you want, 'cause I know how much you like the TV. 
Sometimes  I watch you watching it. 
Think about it. 
Jenna. 
Stop telling everyone I need someone to get me pregnant. 
I'm not telling everyone. 
All right, guys, check this out. 
Oprah and Steadman are the same person. 
You know what? 
I don't have time for this conversation. 
I don't have time for anything. 
That's why he/she won't run for president. 
Hey, you gotta stop doing that impression. 
Tracy hates it. 
What? But it's funny. 
These guys like it. 
The Mars probe didn't brake. 
It was attacked by a Martian cougar. 
This is how you take care of things, Liz Lemon? 
I'm going to Jack Donaghy. 
No, no Tracy, please don't do that. 
Too late. This is untoward. 
This is not toward! 
You better fix this, nerd. 
Otherwise, Jack Donaghy is gonna kill me and then he's gonna kill you. 
And then he's gonna fold us up in a pizza and eat us. 
What? 
Hey Liz! 
I heard you're looking for a hook-up. 
Oh, you know what? 
Everybody, stop working right now! 
I don't wanna have sex with any of you. 
I have plenty of time to have a baby. 
And I am not looking for sperm donors. 
Okay. 
But do you still want a sound hook-up so you can listen to rehearsal? 
Yeah, thanks. 
How are you, Bobby? Good? 
Great. 
Yo! 
Tracy. It's Jack Donaghy. 
I hear we have a problem  with Josh Gerard. 
Damn right! 
Keeps impersonating me. 
Making me into a caricature. 
Well, I would take care of this if I could. 
But it's tricky. 
You see, Josh's father's an assassin with the Russian mafia. 
They call him El Matador. 
Whoa. Those dudes are crazy. 
Forget it, I don't need any of that noise. 
It  happys me to hear you say that. 
For being so understanding. 
I'm sending you our new super top secret invisible motorcycle. 
For reals? 
 For realses. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to see a doctor. 
I keep pooping during sex. 
Lemon, we have a problem. 
I have this whole Tracy/Josh thing under control. 
What are you talking about? 
Nothing. What are you talking about? 
You. You yelling at the crew. 
You trolling for seed. 
Oh, it's a big misunderstanding. 
Jenna thinks that I want to have a baby. 
I should have known this was going to be a problem when I decided to mentor a woman. 
No, in fact, what I said was that my body is trying to make me think I wanna have a baby. 
But my body is not the boss of me. 
My brain is. 
All right, if you insist upon going all Murphy Brown on me, let me give you a tip. 
Don't smother your child with affection to compensate for not having a man in your life. 
Don't say you're the only man I'll ever love. 
Even babies know that's creepy. 
Of course. 
Don't put little notes in their lunch bag that say, "Mommy's watching you." 
People find those things. 
I bet you behaved yourself, though. 
If your child is a terrific hockey player and a gifted flautist, don't make them play the National Anthem on the flute in front of their teammates. 
Your mother did that? 
Now she wants to move in with me. 
I can't have that, Lemon. 
Then be an adult and call her and say you love her very much. 
But that living together is not going to work for you. 
Oh, no. You don't know my mother. 
This is a woman that actually had a heart attack to prevent me from going on my honeymoon. 
Maybe her heart broke because she spent 20 years raising you and you're a total ingrate. 
That's exactly what she said. 
Is this what you want, Lemon, to breathe life into another human being just to spend the rest of your days slowly sucking it out of them? 
No, that's why my brain is the boss. 
Speak of the devil. 
Take a breath. 
Be nice. 
Hello, Mother. 
So nice to hear your voice. 
No, I am not on anything. 
I know that things have been difficult for you lately and I was thinking you carried me for nine months. 
Let me carry you now. 
Well, right back at you, Colleen! 
Yeah, that's right! 
You cut Pop's balls off! 
And left him in the street to die! 
Liz, check out my wedding dress. 
Absolutely not, young lady. 
Kenneth, get Donaghy on the phone. 
Jonathan, I have Tracy Jordan for Mr. Donaghy. 
No. No no no no. 
Tracy, please. 
Do not bother Jack. 
He is in a weird place right now. 
Bebe Jackson's condo? 
No. 
A children's clothing store in Dubai? 
Stop guessing! 
What I'm saying is, leave Jack alone. 
Too late, Liz Lemon. 
He called me five minutes ago. 
Five minutes ago I was with him. 
How did he sound? 
What did he say? 
Nothing unusual. 
Russian mobs, invisible motorcycles... 
Sex pooping. 
Are you insane? 
What are you gonna do when Tracy asks Jack for his invisible motorcycle? 
Uh... Yeah, dummy. 
Here's what you're gonna do. 
It's not your mother. 
Hello? 
Donaghy! 
What's up, Tray? 
If in the future... 
In the future... 
 If I mention anything crazy... 
 If I mention anything crazy... 
 Like an invisible motorcycle... 
 Like an invisible motorcycle... 
 It means I'm off my meds... 
 It means I'm off my meds... 
 and should be ignored. 
 should be ignored. 
Also, I think Josh Gerard is a young Alex Guinness. 
Go back on your meds, Tracy. 
 Hang up. 
 Hang up. 
 What? 
 What? 
 Idiot. 
 Idiot. 
Tracy, I've gotta go. 
Idiot. 
I think that went well. 
Now you gotta call Tracy as Jack. 
Or... 
I could call him... 
as Christopher Walken. 
Do you not understand what we're doing? 
Jenna, did you tell Life and Style that your favorite book is the Koran? 
I just wanted to sound smart. 
Oh, hi, baby! 
Would you take her for a second? 
I'm trying to finish her eyes. 
Oh, I'm actually really busy. 
I heard you were baby crazy. 
No. 
Yes, she is. 
Please. 
Oh, for the love of--nuts. 
Okay. 
Hi! 
How about that, huh? 
Yeah, she likes you. 
Go ahead, walk her around. 
Oh, okay. 
Look how pretty I look. 
Who's the cutest baby in the world? 
Who's the cutest baby in the world? 
Who's the cutest baby in the world? 
How did I get home? 
Why didn't you say something? 
Jack Donaghy. 
Now, I know you asked me not to say anything. 
But I think I know somebody that can help you with your sex poop problem. 
Hi. 
Please don't hurt me. 
I can't help it. 
It just pours out of me.  
I'm Jack Donaghy. 
I'm important. 
I just bought the moon. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm doing it again. 
What? 
Mother, I love you too. 
But living together is not gonna work out for me. 
Yes, I went this morning. 
I  don't know, regular consistency? 
I can't do this. 
Every day for the rest of your or her life. 
And she will outlive you. 
She's like Castro. 
And when you're done with that, call my wife and tell her I'm sorry about what happened with me and Keith and them. 
Wait, who? 
Oh, God! 
It's true that you had the baby. 
I don't know what happened. 
One minute I was holding the baby in make-up and then suddenly... 
It was like highway hypnosis. 
You know, when you pull into your driveway but you don't remember driving home? 
Oh, right right. 
And you have someone else's baby in your car. 
I feel so terrible. 
Give me the baby. 
I'll try to smooth things over. 
What's her name? 
Well, Anna calls her Isobel, but I call her Nancy. 
I think it might be a good idea if I give Anna the rest of the week off. 
Seriously? We're really busy. 
No, of course. Of course. 
Stealing a baby? Really? 
Hey, I found Isobel! 
I'm a hero. 
Hi, baby. 
Hi, muffin. 
Oh, I'm so glad you're back. 
You're loving this, aren't you? 
Oh, yes. 
I'm a big fan of kidnapping. 
Especially by my middle management. 
So the thing you were saying about listening to your mind and not your body, how's that going for you? 
My body's telling me several things. 
First of all, I need to start working out. 
That kid was killing my arms. 
Number two, I could be very happy with a baby that looks nothing like me and didn't bake in my oven. 
Three, I gotta let myself have a personal life. 
What I've been telling you for five months. 
Well, you're right again. 
Right it down in your little "I'm Awesome" book. 
Where are you going? 
You have a rehearsal about to start. 
I stole a baby, Jack. 
I'm taking a half day. 
Fair enough. 
I have to do some thinking. 
Maybe it's impossible to have it all. 
Career, the family... 
But if anybody can figure out how to do it, it's me. 
That's going up. 
Oh, nerds! 
I was talking about you at work today, Mother. 
I think my boss, Mr. Jack Donaghy, 
wishes you were his mother. 
Isn't that something, mother? 
Yes, Kenneth, that's sweet. 
Do you have me on speaker phone again? 
Yes, Ma'am! 
It's just like Charlie's Angels! 
Oh, by the way, did you get your old Halloween decorations I sent you? 
Oh, yes, thank you! 
I'm looking at the kooky skeleton right now. 
I love it! 
You're the best mother in the whole world! 
Okay, calm down, dear. 
Yes, Mother. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman Come on in, Tracy. 
Yo, is this about that little red-headed intern? 
'Cause she asked me to take it out. 
No, no, no. 
I wanted to invite you to join me at a charity golf tourney that Don Geiss is hosting at his country club in Old Saybrook. 
I'm not familiar with about half the words in that sentence. 
How 'bout you come with me to a big party in Connecticut, and meet Don Geiss? 
Is that the gay guy from Project Runway? 
 No. 
He's the CEO of this corporation. 
The big man. 
The dude from my checks? 
The dude from your checks. 
And a good person for you to know. 
A'ight, sure. 
Thanks for inviting me. 
 Okay false alarm. 
It turns out she asked him to take it out. 
Oh, hey. 
I'll see you in CT, Jackie D. 
What's that about? 
I've invited him to join me at a GE charity golf tournament in Connecticut. 
Was Courtney Love not available? 
Liz, all the VPs will be angling to golf with Don Geiss, but my partner will be Tracy Jordan, his grandchildren's favorite movie star. 
Geiss will absolutely choose us, and that's a big deal because being in a foursome with this man can change your life. 
You might want to rephrase that. 
Golf with Geiss means four hours of face time with a man you normally only get 20 minutes with. 
Which one is Geiss again, the bald one? 
No. 
That one. 
Where did that come from? 
I painted it myself. 
Wow, that's really good. 
You want one? 
Consider it done. 
Thanks. 
Simply the best Has anybody seen Condoleeza on Meet the Press yesterday? 
She always sounds so terrified. 
She's always, like, The President has a plan for Iran, and we are currently adhering to that plan. 
Hey, Frank, wake up. 
You're not allowed to sleep through the topical meeting. 
Dude, I'm exhausted. 
I stayed up all night watching a Designing Women marathon. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, yeah, me too. 
At first, I hated it. 
And then I liked it. 
And then I hated it again. 
And then I got horny, and then I fell asleep. 
Well, focus up, we have a lot of work to do. 
Lutz, not while we're working! 
Ay, pero ay Dios mio! 
Oh, I'm sorry Theresa. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay, maybe something about the mid-term elections? 
Hey, what about my Dancing with the Hobo sketch? 
I didn't like it two weeks ago when it was called America's Next Top Hobo, and I didn't like it a month ago, when it was called Hobo Eye for the Straight Guy. 
Deal or No Hobo? 
Hey, Lutz, why don't you approach your job with the same creativity and excitement you have for all-you-can-eat buffets? 
Ooh. Ooh. 
Okay, the van to take you up to Connecticut will be leaving at noon. 
And once you get up to the golf course, you'll be working in pairs. 
So, Tim and Shyla, Amy and Becca, Kenneth and Grace, and Eric and Pat. 
Okay, have fun. 
Don't get drunk. 
Buddy up. 
Mr. Hornberger. 
Yeah? 
Grace and I cannot work together. 
Why not? 
We have a past. 
A romantic past. 
Well, Grace, it's been a pleasure talking to you. 
Grace Park! 
You know this can't happen. 
We're pages. 
I just don't want to disgrace the peacock. 
Oh, Kenneth, if you're worried about disgracing the National Broadcasting Company, you're too late. 
Look, Grace, this is obviously incredibly awkward for both of us, but let's just try to be professional. 
Your peacock earrings look nice. 
Doggone it, Grace, I just don't know myself around you. 
Hello, gentlemen. 
Welcome to the ninth annual Cure Diabetes Now golf tournament. 
Has Don Geiss arrived yet? 
No, sir, but if you'd like, we could work out a signal, so I could let you know when he does arrive. 
Like That won't be necessary. 
I'll probably just do it anyway. 
That cold open you guys wrote last night came out really good. 
Oh, thanks. 
It was like pulling teeth. 
They're so lazy sometimes. 
Especially Lutz. 
Well, good job whipping 'em into shape. 
That thing is really smart. 
Now, when Dennis Hastert farts, should that be live, or pre-recorded? 
Live. 
It has to be live for the timing. 
I thought so too. 
Look at these guys. 
Yeah. 
They like you. 
They're very good at sensing debilitating loneliness in a person. 
Maybe you ought to adopt one. 
Oh, I can't. 
I'm allergic to anything warm and adorable. 
I'm sick of it. 
I'm doing my job, and she just shoots me down in front of everybody. 
I don't care if she's the boss, Liz is a gradeA Runt! 
What? 
This kitten, he's such a runt! 
I'm gonna name you Runty. 
You're such a little raging little runt! 
Come on, Runty. 
Come on. 
Jack, how are you? 
Ted, Amanda, so nice to see you. 
Hello. 
This is Tracy Jordan. 
Ted here is the head of our commercial aviation division. 
You need to hook me up with one of them helicopters. 
Absolutely. 
I'd be happy to arrange for you to take a ride. 
No, I don't want to get in it. 
I want to blow it up and run away from it in slow motion. 
Pleasure to have met you. 
Damn straight. 
I'm delightful. 
You're doing great. 
Everybody loves you. 
On season five, when Delta was really packin' it on Glorious. 
We need to fire Lutz. 
Why, what happened? 
He called me the worst name ever. 
What did he call you? 
I'm not gonna repeat it. 
That's how much I hate it. 
Fat can? 
No. 
Mouth hooker? 
No. 
Monster bitch. 
Hatchet face. 
No! 
The one the rhymes with the name of your favorite Todd Rundgren album. 
It rhymes with Hermit of Mink Hollow? 
No! 
Oh. 
Oh boy. 
Well, you know, he was probably just blowing off steam. 
You can't fire a guy for cursing. 
I'm not upset about cursing. 
I mean, I love cursing. 
I love it. 
But this word is not acceptable because there's nothing you can call a guy back. 
There is no male equivalent to this word. 
Well, why don't we come up with one and then you can call him that? 
Like...monkus. 
Fungdark. 
No, I'm serious, you guys. 
You're just in reaction right now. 
You need to just take a few hours and calm down. 
Don't tell me to calm down you fungdark. 
Yeah, you're right. 
It doesn't work. 
I don't know, I think Liz is right about this. 
Lutz has been totally slacking off since his grandma died. 
What? 
Why didn't you guys tell me? 
I thought you knew and you were just being a... 
You know, that word Lutz called you. 
Wait, are you saying that I am like that sometimes? 
Um... 
Um... 
And they thought my sister couldn't even have a baby, so she's really excited. 
Oh, he's adorable. 
Okay, we're at the bottom of page two. 
Hey, look everybody Sherlock Homo is here to solve the case of the gay sweater. 
I'm telling you guys... 
watching that isn't gonna get us out of here any faster. 
Oh, my God, I am. 
I'm a total... 
Runt! 
Runt! 
I lost my kitten. 
Has anyone seen my runt? 
Runt! 
Runt! 
Bringing Tracy Jordan was a smart move, Jack. 
He's the hit of the party. 
You got that right, my friend. 
Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense six hour foursome with three other men. 
And one of them will be Don Geiss and he's gonna get all of my attention. 
And you're just gonna sit back and watch. 
Would you excuse me? 
You know the army's been messing with the sun. 
That's why I keep my junk covered. 
Once that stuff get in your hang, you're done. 
Would you excuse us for a moment, please? 
What's going on? 
It's game time. 
Jack, you handsome son of a gun! 
This guy gets younger every time I see him! 
No, you're the one. 
Oh, hair like a Viking. 
God bless you. 
Don, I want you to meet my friend Tracy Jordan. 
Tracy Jordan. 
This is exciting. 
My grandchildren just love your movies. 
Thank you so much for being here and supporting diabetes research. 
Hey, I feel you. 
Messed up sugar runs in my family too. 
So, how's your short game? 
You'll find out tomorrow. 
This guys spends so much time in the sand that his nickname should be Falu-ser. 
That's humorous. 
Hey, how come you don't hire more black people around here? 
Beg your pardon? 
How come there's no black people here? 
Black people can't make light bulbs? 
No, actually we have an award winning diversity program. 
How come there's just me and Carlton over there? 
I believe Tracy's referring to Carlton, the straight laced brother from Fresh Prince of Bel Air, 1990 through 1996. On NBC. 
Are we having fun or what? 
My associate's name is Francis Callier. 
And he's a lawyer. 
Excuse me. 
So what time does this golf thing kick off tomorrow? 
It doesn't matter now, Tracy. 
We're not in Geiss' foursome, thanks to you. 
What? 
I can't help it if he got mad. 
You know me. 
I'm gonna say what's on my mind, Jack. 
No, not in here you don't. 
I wanted you to entertain these people, not publicly humiliate them. 
I'm supposed to just be a funny black man who says funny things. 
No, I wanted you to discuss your astounding medical breakthroughs. 
Okay. 
Bartender, could you bring me a Mustang Melon and a bag of barbeque potato chips? 
'Cause apparently I'm only here to be a stereotype. 
Would you keep your voice down, please? 
You're embarrassing yourself. 
No, I'm not embarrassing myself, I'm embarrassing you. 
And guess what, Jack? 
I'm just getting started. 
Son, I wasn't joking about those chips. 
Hey hey hey. 
What do you wanna do about Lutz? 
Should I call him into my office? 
I think we should wait on that. 
Really? Okay. 
Whatcha got? 
A-ha! 
I made something for the writers. 
Brisket! 
No, it's two dozen cupcakes with melted mini-candy bars in the middle. 
Mmm. 
Oh, I get it. 
You're trying to be nice now 'cause of what Lutz said. 
No, I'm not trying to be nice. 
I am nice. 
I'm a nice person you bald, gangly... 
I'm gonna try harder. 
I'm gonna try and be nice. 
I sure hope Mr. Jack 
plays his game good today. 
Otherwise he whups my ass right well when we get home. 
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack? 
You know, Ted, Kenneth here is one of our most promising young pages. 
He knows everything there is to know about the business. 
I studied TV theory at Kentucky Mountain Bible College. 
I studied fried chicken at the school of hard knocks. 
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack? 
You still here? 
I'm ridiculous. 
I'm black! 
I may even be ugly. 
But dear God... 
I'm here! 
I'm here! 
And nothing but them can keep me from it! 
Oh, I'm so sorry. 
I'm so sorry. 
I thought I turned it off. 
No, Cooper, take the call. 
I mean, come on. 
This isn't Hitler's bunker. 
That would make me Hitler. 
What? 
This is the new me. 
Do you like the new me? 
Before you answer, superballs! 
Awesome! 
What a fun boss you have, right? 
Would you like me to do a tap dance for you and your big time friends, Mr. Jack? 
Or I could run around while y'all are throwing rocks at me. 
Kenneth, play this hole for me, would you? 
Come with me. 
What are you doing? 
Payback. 
The way you treated me. 
You used me. 
God, it's like dating Katie Couric all over again. 
I didn't use you. 
I created a situation that could have been mutually beneficial, and you blew it. 
If you can't handle Tracy Jordan, don't invite Tracy Jordan. 
This is what I do. 
I drop truth bombs. 
I don't care about Don Geiss! 
I'm a movie star! 
Oh, my. 
No, no. 
You were a movie star. 
You haven't gotten a movie made in over two years, and you know why? 
Because of your truth bombs. 
Remind me, Tracy, what did you tell the president of Warner Brothers? 
Told him he could suck it. 
And the president of Paramount? 
Told her she could kiss my delicious ass. 
And how's that working for you? 
Yeah, I thought so. 
Hey, why don't you play the game with me? 
Like it or not, guys like Geiss run everything, including movie studios. 
And we could be playing golf with him right now instead of Ted, who's best known for getting caught using a corporate credit card at a gay strip club. 
I'm sorry, Amanda, you were bound to find that out eventually. 
Where is everybody? 
Oh, they all had personal problems they had to take care of. 
Go, go. 
If I thought I left my coffeemaker on, I wouldn't be able to focus either. 
No, no, I get it. 
Everyone should see Mama Mia before it closes. 
What kind of sinus stuff? 
I'm just having some weird sinus stuff. 
Okay. Go home. 
Then I sent Lutz and Frank out to get us some pizzas and they never came back. 
So you're finishing up everyone's re-writes by yourself? 
That's not right. 
Yes, but at least I know that nobody hates me today. 
You think Jack Donagee sits up there and worries if people are saying bad things about him? 
It's different for women. 
I don't think it is. 
Sometimes people hate their bosses. 
Big deal. 
But you gotta stick up for yourself. 
Because if you don't... 
they'll take advantage of you. 
Oh, hey, could I borrow 60 bucks? 
I'm going to meet Frank and Lutz at Scores. 
So I founded the Don Geiss Diabetes Research Foundation which is why you're all here tonight. 
Gwen and I really hope you'll be as generous with your checkbooks as you were on the links today with your scorekeeping. 
Thank you. 
What's he doing? 
Excuse me! 
I know I wasn't asked to say anything, but I would like to share my experience with you. 
When my daughter Shahita was born, she had chubby arms and legs and a big bald head. 
She looked like my Uncle Rupert in a diaper. 
By the time she was five, she was 87 pounds. 
I mean, she could eat! 
But then, when was around eight years old... 
I remember it was Easter. 
We stayed up all night the night before watching bible movies and eating Fiddle Faddle. 
I remember the next day, Easter Sunday, she threw up right in the middle of the Jaguar dealership. 
She was mad sick. 
And I carried her all the way to St. Luke's Roosevelt. 
The doctor said she had diabetes. 
I get very upset because I think I was the cause of that due to my ignorance of nutrition. 
And I promised Sha that night... 
that I was gonna dedicate all my efforts to raise awareness... 
and finding a cure. 
And I just hope that all of you will join me. 
Thank you. 
Unbelievable! 
Record donations. 
I can't thank you enough. 
Jack, I'm gonna be on the Vineyard next month. 
I want you and Tracy to come up, and we'll talk about getting you back in the movie business. 
I'll set that up, sir. 
Okay. 
Tracy, bring your daughter. 
That's a deal. 
Thanks again. 
Congratulations, Tracy. 
And welcome to the grown up world. 
Yeah. 
I don't have a daughter. 
Let's have a casting session on Monday. 
Grace... 
There is something that I must say to you. 
But my words cannot suffice. 
So to quote Mr. Jerry McGuire.... 
you make me a complete person. 
When you said hello, you had me. 
My wife needs her sweater. 
Ow! 
Yes, sir! 
You're watching the Designing Women Marathon on Nick at Nite. 
Sir, you may be right. 
I may be not capable of understanding normal thinking because I think a woman is just as powerful as a man. 
And until you learn to respect me, you better learn to stay out of my way. 
'Cause this is my house. 
This is my house. 
Staying up all night re-writing The Amazing Hobo. 
You fat nerd. 
Good morning, Lemon. 
Hey, Jack, come on! 
You stay up all night? 
How can you tell? 
This is the men's room. 
Oh! 
Did you win your golf parade? 
Even better. 
Next weekend Tracy and I are gonna double team Don Geiss with our big ideas. 
You're so weird. 
Now get out of here. 
I have to yell at my staff. 
Because I'm not just feminine, I also can project my power. 
Didn't you bake us anything? 
Hey, I thought you were gonna being snickerdoodles in. 
That's the only reason I showed up. 
I mean, you can't promise snickerdoodles and then not bring any. 
That's not cool. 
Listen up, everybody. 
Listen to me. 
Listen! 
Shh shh shh shh shh. 
There will be no more baked goods. 
No more walking all over me. 
I was here all night doing your work. 
But at 3:30 this morning, I happened to see this episode of Designing Women. 
And when it came on again at 5:30, I taped it. 
And I want you all to watch very closely. 
Because it sums up so perfectly what I wanna say to you. 
What do I hit, input? 
Is there a TV/VCR button? 
What is aux? 
Hey, can I go now? 
Hang on. 
I want your full attention! 
Why is it making that noise? 
Ugh. 
Okay, never mind. 
But I want to say something to all of you. 
I am the boss here. 
And sometimes that's gonna make me unpopular. 
But the point is... 
I know what you called me, Lutz. 
Oh. 
I'm sorry that I said that. 
Please don't make me move back to Alaska, Liz. 
I hate it there. 
You can stay. 
But if you ever... 
If any of you ever call me that horrible word again, I will fire you. 
And you will never alter drapes in Atlanta again. 
Because you do not cross a Sugarbaker woman! 
I'm so tired. 
I'm so tired, you guys. 
All right, champ. 
It's nonny time. 
Subs by Traff and Raceman /Tracy Jordan to the stage, please. 
/Tracy to the stage. 
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? 
They've been paging you for rehearsal! 
Rehearsal? 
We did a show last week. 
I just came to pick up a paycheck. 
No. We do a show 
every Friday, Tracy. 
It's not gonna work. 
Next Friday is Damon Dash's birthday party. 
And the Friday after that there's an orgy over at Elizabeth Hasselbeck's. 
Yeah? Well, you're part 
of a team now, okay? 
So you have to be in the shows and you have to rehearse. 
And when you rehearse, Jenna would really like it I would like it too if you would read exactly what's on the cue cards. 
It's making everybody crazy. 
Can't do it. 
I'm an improviser. 
My acting style is like jazz. 
Jazz that you laugh at. 
"Ah ha ha ha ha! 
Ah ha ha ha ha!" 
Just try, okay? 
I have a meeting upstairs. 
I'll be right back. 
Pete. 
Do you remember that song I recorded last year when I was dating that Persian record producer? 
Oh...no. 
It's a dance-pop techno hybrid called Muffin Top. 
I gave everybody copies at Christmas? 
Oh, yeah, right. 
I don't remember that. 
Well, apparently it's a number-one hit in Israel. 
Hey, Israel. 
Wow. Yes. 
And I noticed we had a couple of minutes left, so I thought maybe I could do it on the show. 
Okay, you can do the short version. 
You should know that Muffin Top is also number four in Belgium. 
I said you could do it. 
Why not?! 
Oh. I mean, thank you. 
Hello. 
For over a hundred years, GE has been imagining the future... today. 
And I'm here to talk to you today about a wonderful new synergy. 
It's called "product integration." 
It's revolutionizing the way we monetize broadcast television. 
How does it work? 
Simple. 
All you have to do as the writing staff of an NBC show is incorporate positive mentions or PosMens--of GE products into your program. 
For example, you could write an episode where one of your characters purchases and is satisfied with... 
one of GE's direct-current drilling motors for an offshore or land-based project. 
Product integration... 
setting a new standard in upward revenue stream dynamics. 
For all of us. 
Now, I'd be happy to answer any questions. 
I'm sorry. You're saying you want us 
to use the show to sell stuff? 
Look, I know how this sounds. 
No, come on, Jack. 
We're not doing that. 
We're not compromising the integrity of the show to sell Wow. This is diet Snapple? 
I know, it tastes just like regular Snapple, doesn't it? 
You should try Plum-A-Granate. 
It's amazing. 
I only date guys who drink Snapple. 
Look, we all love Snapple. 
Lord knows I do, but focus here. 
We're talking about product integration. 
No, no. We are not your shills. 
Oh! Oh-ho. 
I'm sorry. 
That's right. 
They're artists, like James Joyce or Strindberg. 
Get real, kids. 
You write skits mocking our presidents to fill time between car commercials. 
That's not fair. 
Josh gets a lot of fan mail for Gaybraham Lincoln. 
Did you guys know that Holland is the only country with a national dog? 
I didn't know that. 
Hmm. There's little facts under there. 
/That's a lunch break, everybody. 
Back in an hour, please. 
Um, did you talk to Tracy about reading the cue cards? 
I tried. 
Well, he's not reading them. 
He never reads them, Liz. 
I'm starting to think... 
he can't read! 
Oh, that-- that's just offensive, Jenna. 
I don't know. 
Have you ever seen him read anything? 
Of course. 
Like when we shoot promos. 
Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. 
I'm black, NBC! 
Very proud, like peacocks, right, Janet? 
Hmm. 
Hey, Tracy, I missed that last run-through. 
Could you run it once off cards for me? 
Naw, Lemon.  
I'll do that later. 
I gotta bounce. 
Okay, that's the It says, "Emergency exit only". 
He couldn't read that? 
Man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly since Tracy came along. 
It's so sad. 
What's really sad is that while she's in this fragile state, none of her friends are messing with her head. 
I think we should do something about that. 
Hmm. 
Shh. Okay. 
All right. 
Hey,  what are you guys talking about? 
Oh. Uh...nothing. 
What, is it about me? 
Okay. Um... 
There's a rumor going around that Donaghy has to cut costs around here. 
Oh. 
Yeah. My friend in accounting, 
Lando Calrissian, he says Jack's probably gonna have to fire an actor. 
Oh. 
Thank you guys for telling me. 
It's like shooting fish in a barrel. 
Yeah, if the fish have daddy issues. 
I can't believe you guys actually wrote a product integration sketch. 
Jack said we had to. 
It just seems weird. 
This show's not a commercial. 
Excuse me. 
Can you tell me where Human Resources is, please? 
That way. Thanks. 
This is gonna sound crazy, but, um... 
Tracy can read, right? 
What? Are you serious? 
The guy's done dozens of movies. 
Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem like he's reading a script. 
Let's go rescue Karen or whatever. 
Is there a Cheryl? 
Then she could tell us where drugs are I mean gold Then we got the car chase. 
I'm getting way too old for this! 
Was I supposed to say that then? 
That's true. 
And he never reads the cue cards... 
God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy seeing what he could get away with. 
I know, but, you know, it's not surprising. 
Look at the educational system in this country. 
We spend all this money in Iraq, but meanwhile, our inner-city graduation rates are lower than they are in the Sudan. 
That  doesn't sound right. 
Maybe it was Sweden. 
Maybe it was teen pregnancy. 
I gotta read more. 
What can I do for you? 
So we wrote a product integration sketch. 
Good. But we wanted to run it 
by you first because it's about how GE is making us do this. 
And we were kinda hoping that the GE executive in the sketch could be played by...you. 
Oh, I get it The whole self-referential thing: Letterman hates the suits, Stern yells at his boss, Nixon's "sock it to me" on Laugh-In. 
Yeah. 
Hippy humor. 
That's what I'm going for. 
Well, as you know, I've been studying comedy and learning what's funny. 
I'm watching Friends right now. 
What happens with Ross and Rachel? 
No, no. Don't tell me. 
Seriously. What were you saying? 
So will you do it? 
I don't know, Lemon. 
I'm not an actor. 
This is your world. 
Oh, come on. 
You can do this. 
You were great in that video. 
Yeah! 
This is live television. 
I've never done anything like that before. 
Okay, I'll do it. 
Ohh! Great, great. 
Thanks, Jack. 
So rehearsal will be tomorrow at 2:00. 
Please don't be late. 
And I will fax you any changes by 9:00 a.m. 
You're such a Monica! 
Ah ha! 
You are. 
Uhh. 
He never reads anything. 
Uh, why is Jack Donaghy on the cast list? 
Oh, he's gonna do this GE sketch. 
It's really funny. 
Oh, so he gets to be in sketches, but he's gonna fire one of the real actors? 
What? 
I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire one of the actors to cut costs. 
No. I haven't heard anything like that. 
Don't worry about it. 
Oh, I'm not worried... 
Because I have something the other actors don't. 
A secret weapon. 
Oh, don't say your sexuality. 
My sexuality! 
Oh, God, Jenna, when has that ever worked? 
Uh, when has it not worked? 
It'll be a 45-minute wait. 
Oh, will it? 
Uh, yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah, it will. 
Yeah, but this is different because I know Jack Donaghy. 
I know what he likes. 
Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself ten years younger and Asian. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
They're making me rehearse. 
I know Pat Benatar rarely performs live. 
Scalp the damn tickets. 
These are the changes for the sketches that you're in. 
Cool. I'll read those later, Lemon. 
Tray... 
Can you read? 
Can I read? 
Please don't get angry. 
It's not your fault. 
It's the system. 
Did you ever see Hoop Dreams? 
It's like that. 
So you're asking me if I'm illiterate? 
You  don't even have to answer me if you don't want to. 
Just know that if you need a tutor, we will get you a tutor. 
If you need to be in fewer sketches until you get more confident, we'll accommodate you, whatever you need. 
So I could, like, leave work early if I need a tutor? 
Absolutely. 
We'll work around your schedule. 
I can't read, Liz Lemon! 
My shameful secret is out. 
Now you know why I'm always running into the ladies' bathroom. 
I can't read! 
I sign my name with an X! 
I once tried to make mashed potatoes with laundry detergent! 
I think I voted for Nader! 
Nader! 
I feel as though a great weight has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon. 
Today is the first day of the rest of my life. 
All thanks to one very, very special white lady. 
I'll be in late tomorrow. 
Damn, George Will just gets more and more conservative. 
Liz? 
Hi. Did you tell Jack 
he can be on the show? 
Yeah, he was kind of excited about it, actually. 
Oh, yeah, he's very excited. 
But you cannot put him on live TV. 
Why? 
Okay. 
I'm only showing you this because I care about him so much. 
GE Promo. 
Take one. 
Action! 
 Did you say, "Action"? 
 Yes. Action! 
 Could you say it louder, please? 
 I'm sorry. 
Action! 
GE Promo. 
Take two. 
Hello. 
For over a hundred years Line? 
Sorry. 
My bad. 
What's the first line? 
Product integration! 
Okay.  
Right, got it. 
I just need the first word. 
Product! 
What's the second word? 
Integration. 
Okay, I knew that. 
Okay, d-d-uh... 
If I ask for the line again, don't tell me. 
Line? 
 Line? 
 Product integration. 
I  told you don't give me the line when I ask for the line. 
I got it. 
I got it. 
Could we get a do-over there? 
Let's go again, can we? 
What? 
What is it? 
I don't like this at all. 
Okay, I got it. 
Let's go again. 
The pen doesn't really write. 
Does that matter? 
And I'm here today My bad. 
I'm sorry. 
Oh...God. 
Why don't we go to lunch and we'll come back and maybe Let's all go have lunch. 
GE Promo. 
126. 
It's weird. 
What do I do with my arms? 
I've never thought about that before. 
Is it this? 
Or, if I may, this? 
Maybe I should just hold something. 
OK, yeah, this feels more natural. 
Is that right? Yeah. 
"New synergy" does that sound odd to anyone else? 
Does that sound like "news energy"? 
And this satisfies Oh. Ouch, ouch. 
You all right? 
Could I get a little, uh... 
I'm here to talk to you television about the monetizing of today broadcast. 
Was any of that usable? 
GE Promo. 129. 
It's called, "racial integration" No, that's not right, is it? 
It's called, "product intergort" "intergortian"? 
...the way we monetize broadcast television. 
How does it work? 
Oh! 
Could we turn off the phones, please? 
Oh, I'm sorr--ha! 
I'm sorry. That's me. 
Let me turn this thing off here. 
I think I just took a picture. 
I'm sorry, everybody, there's a  pigeon. 
Shoo! 
...purchases, 
and is satisfied with--Oh. 
142. 
...in upward revenue 
stream dynamics. 
For all of us. 
Cut. 
That's a wrap. 
Ha! That was fun, 
you guys. 
Didn't feel like five days, did it? 
No. Nah, that wasn't bad. 
Everybody have a good weekend. 
And... we'll be right back. 
/Jenna to the stage, please. 
Jenna to the stage for Muffin Top. 
Hey, Liz? 
Liz... 
I'm a little bit nervous about this rehearsal. 
Oh, I'm glad you brought that up. 
You know, you don't have to do this. 
I know how busy you are. 
Oh, no, I have to do it. 
It's a new challenge, and I like challenges. 
I've summited Kilimanjaro. 
I've showered with Greta Van Susteren. 
I--I'm gonna do this, yeah. 
The time, sir. 
Oh, that's right. 
Do you mind? 
We'll do it around the corner, okay? 
I'll be with you in a minute. 
I have a conference with my corporate division head. 
Oh, yeah? 
Are you guys gonna... 
...correlate overseas 
earnings report dynamics? 
Yes. 
Liz? 
Did I just hear Jack? 
Oh, no, no, no. 
Please. 
I know for a fact he is talking to his boss right now. 
Really? 
Don't bother him. 
Fine. 
Don't. 
Of course, sir. 
I'll look into it right away. 
Actions speak louder than words. 
Take care of it. 
Don't worry, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning. 
Look, I am tired of your promises! 
I want this thing fixed. 
I'm-- I'm on it, sir. 
So... 
You're Jack's boss, huh? 
Oh, well, yeah, that's what they tell me. 
I'm Jenna, by the way. 
Oh, I, uh, I know who you are. 
I'm Ron. 
Oh, Ron. 
How do you take your coffee, Ron? 
I take it? Uh... 
I--I take it, uh, with the non-dairy creamer. 
Mmm. Yeah. 
Non-dairy creamer. 
Yum. 
Ahem. 
Ahem. 
Mmm. 
Ahh. 
Oh, yeah. 
Eh-heh. Wow. 
Quiet, please! 
Rehearsing! 
From Mr. Donaghy's entrance. 
What's up, Mr. Donaghy? 
That's Josh's line. 
Your lines are in blue. 
My bad. 
I'm sorry. 
Those cards are a little confusing. 
Hello, everyone. 
Thanks for waiting, please. Sit...down. 
Okay, that's great. 
Just one thing, sir. 
You're looking into the camera a little bit. 
No, I'm not. 
I want to, but I'm not. No. 
Could I get two coffee cups? 
Yeah, you know, let's take five minutes, actually, uh, everybody,  while we get Mr. Donaghy some coffee cups. 
I know you want to do this, but I don't think it's working out. 
I agree. It's the writing. 
It's not natural. 
Uhh! Really? 
You think the problem is the writing? 
Yeah. It's clunky. 
Wow. Well, I was really trying to help you out of this, 
but, you know what? You're the boss. 
I think I can do it. 
No.  You should definitely do it. 
It'll be hilarious. 
Oh, well, that'd be a refreshing change of pace for the show, wouldn't it? 
Excuse me. 
Why would Tracy pretend to be illiterate? 
To get out of coming to work. 
Oh, so first you thought he was illiterate, and now you think he's lazy? 
Jeez, you are racist. 
No. Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, 
which is to be used only for good, like over-tipping and supporting Barack Obama. 
Summon. 
Hey, Tray. 
Kenneth told me you finally got in to work. 
Yeah, I had to go to reading class. 
You hear this mess about sometimes Y being a vowel? 
What a world. 
Ah... 
Well, we just wanted to show you the new posters for the show. 
Yeah, all right. Cool. 
So it's okay to hang these all over the city? 
Yeah. 
It's good. 
I like it. 
Really? 
Really. 
I'll be leaving early today. 
/Jenna and Ghostface Killah, /to the stage, please, for Muffin Top. 
Hello? 
Jack? 
It's 3:00 in the morning. 
What's wrong? 
That's quite a commitment to such terrible writing. 
Lemon, I don't know how to do this. 
I know. 
I don't get it. 
It's not the fear. 
I thrive on fear. 
You're looking out a fake window right now, by the way. 
I bow-hunt polar bear. 
I once drove a rental car into the Hudson just to practice escaping. 
And it's not the public speaking. 
There's just something about performing that I can't wrap my brain around. 
All this creative crap. 
Acting! 
oh... 
I've never been able to do it. 
Never. 
Grains and cereals are an important Oh! 
Line! 
Damn it! 
Son of a bitch! 
Lemon. 
I need your help. 
Really... 
Jack Donaghy needs my Don't gloat. 
It makes you seem mannish. 
Okay. 
Look, this is not your fault. 
This whole thing was a bad idea. 
We should just have Josh do it, and we'll just tell everyone you're on a business trip. 
That's not an option. 
I have to do it. 
Once I set my mind to something, I have to accomplish it. 
Ten years ago, I was an inch-and-a-half shorter than I am today. 
Sheer willpower. 
If I don't figure this thing out by Friday, then failure wins, and that's not acceptable. 
Oh, God, the room is spinning. 
What do you want from me? 
I'm one of your actors. 
I'm freaking out. 
Talk me down. 
Okay, here's your pep talk. 
You're not an actor. 
You're Jack Donaghy, all right? 
So quit whining and nut up. 
You're right, if you can't do this, you are a failure. 
Josh can do this, and earlier today, he ate a club sandwich with the toothpicks still in it. 
Jenna can do this, and she was once engaged to David Blaine. 
Any dumb-dumb can act, Jack, so be a man and get it done. 
If you were any other woman on earth... 
I would be turned on right now. 
Go home. 
Get some sleep. 
This stays between us, right, Lemon? 
Lemon? 
Lemon? 
Lemon? 
Well, I don't think I have to worry about my job anymore. 
And I didn't bother Jack at all. 
Oh, good for you. 
That's right. 
I took your advice. 
I hooked up with his boss. 
 Who, Ron? 
 Mmhmm. 
That guy's an extra on the show. 
No. He said he was Jack's boss. 
No. In the sketch. 
He doesn't even have a line. 
He doesn't have lines? 
Don't eat in costume! 
Give me a break. I'm just 
But he was yelling at Jack. 
Actions speak louder than words. 
Take care of it. 
Don't worry, sir, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning. 
I am tired of your promises. 
I just want this thing fixed now! 
I'm on it, sir. 
What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm? 
Ew. 
Oh, God, Jenna. 
I told you, don't listen to rumors. 
But Frank and Toofer said to me Frank and Toofer? 
That's where you're getting your information? 
They're messing with you! 
No. They wouldn't do that to me. 
Yeah, they would. 
Oh! 
I am gonna get back at them... 
using my sexuality. 
Do you have any left? 
/Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma /to the stage, please, for Muffin Top. 
 Where the hot lesbians at, Lemon? 
 I knew it! 
You can read! 
Fine. 
Yes, I'm literate! 
I even have a column in Ebony called Musings! 
You are unbelievable. 
I'm unbelievable? 
What about your racist mess? 
Thinking a grown man is illiterate. 
That's the subtle racism of lowered expectations. 
Bing Crosby said that. 
No, Bill Cosby said that. 
That's racist. 
Look, we can all agree Liz is generally pretty racist. 
The point is, you have people counting on you. 
You can't be finding excuses not to be here. 
But this job is hard! 
I just want to be able to do what I want to do. 
You know, I once shot a whole movie without ever getting out of my car? 
Yeah, I paid to see that. 
That was supposed to be a western. 
You're not a big shot movie star anymore, Tray. 
You're the star of TGS, and you will read the lines as written, starting tonight because this show is important. 
I set a very high standard for myself, and I expect the same of the professionals who work with me. 
When Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch, can I go cross-eyed? 
Oh, yes, do that. 
That's hilarious! 
Hey have you seen Frank or Toofer? 
Pete! 
The standards lady is saying that my moaning in Muffin Top is too graphic. 
Which of these is less offensive? 
Ahh! Ahh! 
Ahhh! 
Or... 
Ooh-hunh! 
Unh-hunh! 
Ohhh! 
Both sound good to me. 
Hello, Ron. 
I would just hate for Muffin Top to get cut because of a standards problem. 
I've already posted it on my weblog though I'll be doing it. 
Jenna, we're not gonna cut it. 
Are you messing with me? 
Because people around here keep messing with me. 
I'm not messing with you. 
So which one? Ahh! 
Or, ohhh! 
Uh, I guess... 
Uh, "ahh ahh! Ahh." 
Oh, Hey. Look, 
it's no big deal, but we had to make some changes in your sketch, okay? 
I have new pages for you. 
You do? 
Yeah. Tracy is now in it now, 
so we had to change some of the cues. 
Also, the opening VT is cut, so you just go right out, okay? 
Oh, and, um, you all say the last line together. 
Wow. So, uh... 
So you're gonna be great. 
Have fun. 
Lemon, these pages are blank. 
Oh. 
Never mind. 
Withdrawn. 
And, remember, don't look into the camera! 
Toofer? 
Yeah? 
Can I tell you a secret? 
Sure. 
We've been working together a while, and I know this may sound crazy, but I've been watching you. 
I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock, and we make love while looking out at the city  Okay, let me guess. 
You figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even, you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there. 
Nice try. 
Where's Frank? 
But we're cool, right, Mr. Donaghy? 
No, you're all fired. 
No, you're all fired. 
Hey, good job the other night. 
Oh, you mean on the show? 
Thanks. 
What were you watching? 
Nothing. Uh... 
Bloomberg. 
Hmm. 
Aha! 
Don't be cute, Lemon. 
You're too old for that. 
Good God! 
Lemon! 
Mr. Donaghy, open up! 
Please? 
Lemon! 
* Everyone knows * The most delicious part of the muffin * * Is the top * My muffin top * Is all that whole grain, low-fat * * I know you want a piece of that * * But I just wanna dance * * Ch-checkin' out my sweet hips * * My sugar-coated berry lips * * I know you want to get with this * * But I'm just here to dance * * So back * Up off of me * You're we-ee-ee-eirding * Me out * I'm an independent lady * So do not try to play me * * I run a tidy bakery * The boys all want my cake for free * Does she know we went off the air two minutes ago? 
 No, she does not. 
 Smart move. 
Subs by Raceman and Traff The flowers are lovely. 
Thank you. 
No, you hang up first. 
Okay, on the count of three. 
One, two, three... 
No, I didn't hang up either. 
Donaghy, I need your help. 
I miss you too. 
I said I miss you too. 
You're breaking up. 
Maureen? 
She cut out. 
I need $60,000, or I'm gonna lose my house. 
Which house? 
I need $100,000, or I'm gonna lose both my houses! 
Tracy, I don't understand. 
You've starred in 14 films. 
You don't have any money saved? 
Nah, I lost all of it. 
Really? 
Who's your money manager? 
Grizz. 
Worldcom, man. 
Worldcom. 
Look, Tracy, I can't just give you money. 
But what I can do is show you how you can earn all the money you need. 
You must know Arsenio. 
Hall or Billingham? 
You know someone named Arsenio Billingham? 
Put his name and face on a product. 
Because of Arsenio's "woof-woof" catchphrase, we settled on dog food. 
The product was a runaway success. 
The company and Arsenio made millions. 
I like that. 
Put my name on something. 
But what would I sell? 
The product is irrelevant. 
The people aren't buying that. 
They're buying you. 
Now, you come back with an idea of a product you'd be willing to sell, anything at all, and you'll have all the money you can dream of. 
I'm on it. 
I forgot about that Worldcom mess. 
Why you gotta be so obsessed with telecommunications? 
Get me Maureen Dowd back on the phone, please. 
Hey, I've got to miss an hour of rehearsal today because I just found out from my publicist I've been booked on The View. 
Oh, Jenna, that's great. 
For the first time in your life, you'll be in a room full of women and you'll be the least crazy one. 
I know. 
(Liz) Oh, you know what clip you should show? 
"MTV: Darfur." 
You and Tracy were really funny in that. 
Oh, this isn't for TGS. 
It's for my movie. 
The Rurr-Jurr has a limited release next week. 
Oh, congratulations! 
I didn't know they had a release date for The Rurr For that movie. 
Oh, sorry. 
Gotta take this. 
Hello? 
You still don't know what the title is? 
No! No one does. 
It's gone on way too long to ask her about it. 
This title isn't hard to understand, right? 
No, it's awesome! 
I love that we can work while we're on cocaine! 
Could it be Roar Her, Gem Her? 
No, that doesn't make any sense. 
It's got to be Oral Germ Whore. 
Okay, bye. 
Sorry, that was my publicist. 
You know, I have to admit, I kind of like that Tracy Jordan is no longer the only movie star on TGS. 
Maybe I'll finally start getting some respect around here. 
What's up, flabby butt? 
You look weird today. 
Hey, Pete, you wanna see a comic book with pregnant zombie nuns? 
Yes, I do. 
Cool. 
And I have a screener of the movie for you. 
I want you to watch it. 
Ah, The Rural Juror! 
That is something. 
I can't wait to watch it. 
Oh, you won't be disappointed. 
The source material was amazing. 
It's hard to go wrong with a Kevin Grisham novel. 
 You mean John Grisham. 
 Oh, no. 
Kevin, John's brother. 
Did you know that before Kevin was a novelist, he worked at a recycling center? 
Wow. 
Yeah, and he just finished writing a sequel. 
It's called Urban Fervor. 
Boy, these titles They really make you think. 
Oh, wow! 
Doesn't it seem like just yesterday we were doing the show back in Chicago, dreaming about being in the movies? 
We've come a long way from that apartment we shared in Little Armenia. 
Oh, it was so weird there. 
You remember that neighborhood festival where they killed a goat in the street? 
Yes! 
But we did have really good luck that year. 
Yeah. 
I need to come up with a big idea for a product to put my name on. 
Something no one has thought of. 
Something crazy. 
I know a gentleman who had a lot of crazy ideas. 
He was a carpenter.  
He wanted everyone to love one another. 
Oh, you mean Jesus? 
No-- Miguel from set design. 
He's over there. 
Eurek-o! 
Hey. 
What are you doing back here? 
They're rehearsing your Paris Hilton sketch. 
I'm trying to avoid Jenna. 
She gave me a screener of her movie. 
And? 
Oh, Pete, it's awful! 
I couldn't believe how bad it was. 
Although, I guess it's no surprise that Tony Hawk can't play blind. 
So you must know the title! 
Yes, yes-- The Rural Juror. 
 The Rrr  Rural. 
 The Ruh  Rural. 
Eh. 
(Pete) So, what are you gonna do about Jenna? 
(Liz) Same thing I've always done when she's done something terrible. 
Think of one thing nice to say and then hug her. 
So, what did you think? 
Oh, my God! 
You looked so beautiful. 
The lighting was really neat. 
Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read. 
So, what nice thing are you going to say about The Roaring Junior? 
Uh, I don't know. 
It's a mess. 
No, you've got to tell them that when Paris Hilton tries to make out with the bear, the bear has to act like he's into it. 
All right. 
Mr. Donaghy, stop what you're doing 
because I'm about to blow your mind! 
Hit it! 
Tired of your sandwich making you angry? 
Then behold the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine! 
Stick any three meats Whatever you want! 
Bologna, salami, boar Whatever! 
Into this sexy lady and she will melt them all together into one delicious food ball. 
Never again will you have to suffer through the bread part of your sandwich. 
I give you the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine! 
(all) Meat is the new bread! Uh-huh! 
What do you think? 
Well, it's certainly not the worst celebrity product idea I've ever heard. 
Hi, I'm Whoopi Goldberg. 
And you're Working Out With Whoopi. 
With Tracy Jordan behind this, it just might work. 
We'll roll it out in time for Christmas. 
Manufacture it for four bucks, slap your name on it, and sell it for 50. 
So GE will produce the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine? 
Oh, no. No. 
GE could never make something so, um... 
Unique. 
We'll have to pass this off to one of our subsidiaries. 
You see, GE owns KitchenAll of Colorado, which, in turn, owns JMI of Stanford, which is a majority shareholder in Pokerfastlane.com, 
which recently acquired the Sheinhardt Wig Company, which owns NBC outright. 
NBC owns Winnipeg Iron Works which owns the Ahp Chanagi Party Meats corporation of Pyongyang, North Korea. 
And they will make the Meat Machine. 
Jack Donaghy, you are the best. 
(Tracy) You know what? 
I'm gonna make you a mix tape. 
You like Phil Collins? 
I've got two ears and a heart, don't I? 
All right, Jenna's on next. 
Everyone shut up so we can hear the title of this stupid movie. 
And coming up, I'll be talking to The Girlie Show star Jenna Maroney about her upcoming project, The Rrr-Jrr. 
That is not helpful. 
Hey, do you know the name of Jenna's movie yet? 
Oh, yeah, she gave me a screener. 
 Okay! 
 No, no, no I'm not telling you anything about it. 
I'm not giving you more ammunition to make fun of her with. 
So it's bad. 
How bad? 
Please! 
Just give us one detail. 
Okay, fine. 
Jenna plays a southern lawyer named Constance Justice. 
You gotta let us see this. 
 No! 
 Come on, Liz! 
No! 
Oh, man. 
Constance Justice. 
Justice has been served. 
Good stuff. 
Tracy to the stage please for Pull Your Own Wisdom Teeth. 
(Jenna) Oh, excuse me. 
Hey, there you are. 
So, what did you think of the movie? 
Oh, my God, Jenna! 
The soundtrack was so moody. 
What else did you like about it? 
What? Oh, um... 
You were good! 
Your face was very expressive. 
And another cool part was...the trees. 
I gotta get back to work. 
You didn't like the movie. 
What? 
Yes, I just said I like the movie. 
No, you didn't. 
You did that condescending compliment thing you always do. 
What? When have 
I ever done that? 
So, what did you think? 
Oh, my God... 
You looked beautiful. 
The lighting was really neat. 
Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read. 
Well, that's not how I remember any of that. 
Look, Liz, for once, be honest with me. 
I want your real opinion. 
Okay, I thought the story was preposterous. 
I thought the acting was way over the top. 
And I thought it was about an hour too long. 
It's only 90 minutes. 
It's kind of a train wreck. 
A train wreck? Okay. 
I'm not trying to be a jerk here. 
You asked me for my opinion. 
No, no I understand. 
Thank you. 
I wasn't kidding about how cool those trees were, though. 
What were they? Oaks? 
Damn it! 
Where are my car keys? 
Jack, Tracy What can I do for you? 
Leo, we have a product we want you to give a medical endorsement to. 
I'll do it! 
What is it? 
It's called the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine. 
It's a dual-press grill. 
Say no more. 
If it's giving people meat, then I'm onboard. 
I've always said humans need more animal blood. 
It keeps the spine straight. 
We appreciate it, Leo. 
You boys need anything while you're here? 
Some reds, yellows... 
Just got some purples in from Peru. 
No, I'm good. 
Well, it would be rude not to take, uh... 
One or two. 
Now, The Rrr Jrr is the true story of Rory Jerner, whose pure furor ensures a terrible murder Excuse me. 
I feel like I'm getting further away from it. 
Hey, last night I broke into Liz's office. 
I got Jenna's movie. 
Oh, how'd you get in there? 
That weird security guard Tony let me in. 
I also looked on Liz's computer. 
Her last two Google searches were for singles yoga and scalp pain. 
That is grim. 
The Rural Juror? 
Man, that's disappointing. 
I had to let Tony watch me pee to get that tape. 
What? 
Hey, you wanted to see me? 
Yeah, I don't want to wear this Paris Hilton nose. 
(Liz) I'm sorry. 
You have to wear the nose. 
There's a whole bunch of jokes in the sketch about the nose. 
Well, to be perfectly honest, I think the entire sketch is a train wreck. 
Oh, I see. 
We're not talking about the nose. 
We're talking about the movie. 
You're wrong about it, Liz. 
It's getting some very positive early reviews. 
Teenmoviescene.com gave it five out of five iPods. 
Jenna, believe what you want. 
I'm your friend. I'm telling you the truth. 
Please Here's what's really going on. 
It's killing you that I'm in something good that you had nothing to do with. 
And now you're taking it out on me. 
Oh, come on! 
Well, enjoy kicking me around for now, Liz. 
Because I won't be on your crappy little show forever. 
Really? 
Really. 
Really? 
Really. 
Really? 
Really. 
Well, Jenna, I'm sorry you feel that way. 
Ow! What the hell? 
Oh, God, I'm sorry! 
I didn't know there was a person in there! 
Pete, could you tell Liz Lemon not to stand in my eyeline while I'm rehearsing, please? 
Pete, could you tell Jenna she smells like a stripper? 
So, uh... 
Are you guys still fighting? 
We've reached kind of an understanding. 
She's not talking to me. 
And to retaliate, I'm writing impressions for her that she can't do. 
I did not have sexual relations with that woman. 
You guys can't go on like this. 
You have to apologize to her. 
I didn't do anything wrong! 
She insisted on me telling her what I thought of her crappy movie. 
And then she attacked me. 
Liz, I can't have the head writer and one of the stars of the show fighting. 
I can barely keep a lid on the feud going on between Kenneth and Dougie from props. 
Audience, let me ask you a question. 
How many times has this happened to you? 
Or this: Seem familiar? 
Bread is one of the worst things in the world. 
But we've always needed it. 
Until now! 
By burning three different types of meat together, The Tracy Jordan Meat Machine takes bread out of the equation! 
Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff. 
That's delicious! 
And it's healthy. 
Hi, I'm Doctor Leo Spaceman. 
I'm a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Minh City School of Medicine. 
Doctor Space-man, is it true that bread eats away at your brain? 
We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research! 
Well, folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again! 
Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine Say it with me now! 
(all) Meat is the new bread! 
Where did you guys get this tape? 
Oh, Josh broke into your office. 
You went in my office without permission? 
Because I'm worried about your scalp pain. 
Hello, everyone. 
Frank, could you tell Liz Nope, not interested. 
Girl writer, could you tell Liz that I don't Jenna, stop this. 
It's stupid. 
Let's just go in my office and talk. 
Oh, there is nothing to talk about. 
Stop making this something it isn't. 
I just didn't like the movie because it's bad. 
These guys watched it. 
They'll tell you. 
Actually, we all kind of liked it. 
What? No, you didn't. 
Yeah, we all did. 
It's not the best thing in the world, but it's solid and Jenna's really good in it. 
Thank you, Frank. 
Look! Look at her! 
She can't stand that I'm in something good. 
It's probably because of her own intellectual insecurities. 
What? Frank, shut up. 
Fine, dismiss me. 
I guess because I look weird, I can't be perceptive. 
I can't believe you like this movie! 
Oh! 
Jeez, I hope those two work it out. 
Relax, man. 
As long as they're yapping at each other, we're not working. 
Enjoy it. 
I want these everywhere! 
I want every person here eating from a Tracy Jordan Meat Machine. 
Ow, ah! 
Cheese and crackers, that smarts! 
What happened? 
The grease burned me, Mr. Jordan. 
The machine must be broken. 
That one must be defective. 
Oh, ow! My face! 
My page jacket! 
They all must be like that! 
Where's Donaghy? 
Can somebody take me to a hospital? 
Jenna, stop. 
I just want to get past this. 
What do you need me to do? 
Well, you can start by saying you're sorry. 
To Fine. 
I am sorry that I assumed other people would hate the movie just because I hate it. 
That was wrong. 
That's it? 
That's your apology? 
Yeah. Are we good? 
 We're good. 
 Great. 
So, do I have to wear the nose tonight? 
Yes, you do. 
Okay, well then I hope you get bird flu and die. 
What did you just say to me? 
You are a big fake, you know that, Liz? 
She doesn't even need those glasses. 
Really, I'm a fake, blondie? 
I'm a fake? 
Burning jets of grease, huh? 
Were any of our people hurt? 
 Only Kenneth. 
 Good. 
What are we gonna do? 
We can't sell this. 
You're right, we can't sell this... 
in the United States. 
What? 
We simply have to find a market with lax safety regulations. 
With your international appeal, we can go anywhere. 
How about the Ukraine? 
Not the Ukraine. 
I own some property on the Dnieper River. 
In Volyn? 
Closer to Cherkasy. 
Well, we'll find another country then. 
How do you feel about Venezuela? 
Can't do it, Donaghy. 
I can't put my name on a product that's gonna hurt people. 
That's disappointing. 
Although I admire your integrity. 
Mr. Donaghy,  
they need you on stage immediately. 
Some kind of emergency. 
For crying out loud. 
I'm sorry that we're not all weeping with gratitude at getting to read your words. 
I am so glad I studied voice at Northwestern so I could do raps about Suri Cruise. 
Oh, please! 
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be slutting it up for car dealership owners so they'd put you in their commercial. 
Oh, so now I'm a slut? Yeah. 
Let me tell you something. 
This slut slept with your brother! 
Mitch? 
Yeah, and let me tell you something about Mitch. 
He is disgusting in bed. 
You know he's not right. 
He was in a really bad skiing accident! 
Ladies. 
Sit down. 
Now, what is this about? 
It's about my movie, The Rrr Jrr. 
They've adapted The Rural Juror? 
I'm a huge Kevin Grisham fan. 
Jenna has taken the fact that I don't like her movie and blown it completely out of proportion. 
She twisted my boob. 
Liz, you wanted the movie to be bad. 
You wanted me to fail. 
Okay, let me tell you something, Jenna. 
Liz has always supported you. 
Even when I wanted you out of here, she wouldn't give in. 
I've never seen her so worked up. 
She came at me with that angry little badger face of hers There it is right now. 
The point is, she went to the mat for you. 
And she was right. 
 I know, but  But nothing. 
Now you're accusing Liz of undermining you? 
They did warn me those diet pills were mood altering. 
Yeah? 
I think you owe her an apology. 
Oh, Liz... 
I'm sorry. 
No, don't be. 
You're right. 
I did want the movie to be bad. 
Wow. 
The one time I try to take your side, Lemon, and you sandbag me. 
I'm sorry, Jenna. 
I smelled crazy in here and I assumed it was you. 
God, Liz, I mean I wish you had written my movie too. 
No, it's not that. 
It's just The dream that we had in Chicago of getting famous We had it. 
It was my dream too, Jenna. 
Yeah, but you couldn't have been serious about acting for a living. 
You have brown hair. 
Look, I like what I do now. 
But there's still this sad little part of me that wants to be the center of attention. 
That wants to get my hair done and get free clothes. 
That wants to be you, I guess. 
And your movie just brought all that stuff up again. 
This is boring. 
I'm bored now. 
Oh, God, Liz. 
I had no idea. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm a jackass. 
No, I'm sorry. 
So you really think I'm beautiful? 
I never said that. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Tell me (in russian): Feed me, Whoopi! 
(all) Whoopi! 
What's this? 
I gave the Meat Machine to Whoopi. 
Goldberg or Billingham? 
Looks like Whoopi's made herself another billion grivka. 
Food ball? 
Let's get personal. 
Your father Werner was a burger server in suburban Santa Barbara... 
Yes, that's right. 
When he spurned your mother Verna for a curly-haired server named Roberta, did that hurt her? 
It was hard on all of us, yes. 
I'll always be his little girl. 
All right, we have a lot to get through today, you guys. 
Anybody have anything on page one? 
I think we need to change this Donald Trump joke because Donald Trump was eaten by a lion this morning on the International Space Station. 
Anyone listening? 
Yeah, okay, Cerie, how about instead of doing the scripts, why don't you just organize those videotapes? 
Oh, okay. 
Okay, actually, could you go downstairs and get me a chai tea? 
Okay. 
Um, where are my shoes? 
No, no, just go. 
Just go barefoot! 
Just leave you shoes. 
Okay. 
We gotta change this Trump joke. 
 Mr. Jordan. 
 What's up, Ken? 
I got your car washed like you asked. 
And I got that "Baby on Board" sign you wanted to help you get tail. 
Thanks, Ken. 
You done good. 
It's my pleasure and my job, sir. 
Anything you ever need, just ask. 
But I want you to know something. 
You and me, it's not gonna be a one-way street. 
'Cause I don't believe in one-way streets. 
Not between people and not while I'm driving. 
Oh, okay. 
So here's some advice I wish I would've got when I was your age. 
Live every week like it's Shark Week. 
Excellent call, guys. 
Good old Stan there. 
Happy Birthday, Stan. 
All right, we're halfway done. 
Let's take a little break. 
You guys want to have a one-minute dance party? 
Good idea. 
Crank it, Toofer. 
* Grown and sexy from your head down to your toes * * You know you're fine * Got that perfect face, a perfect shape * * And perfect smile... 
Yeah, shake it! 
Feel the music. 
Ahem! 
Oh, Mr. Donaghy! 
No, please... 
finish your dance. 
Oh, we were just taking a little break. 
And we all love the music of Chamillionaire. 
I see. 
If you don't mind, I'll just observe from over here. 
You will? 
Why? 
Are you familiar with Six Sigma? 
Oh, yeah, it's a special kind of G.I. Joe. 
It's Frank, right? 
Yes, sir. 
Yeah. Frank... 
Six Sigma is the elite GE executive training course. 
To master just its basic concepts, one must brave a five-day conference at a Sheraton. 
Six Sigma says that a manager must understand every aspect of the business he or she oversees. 
Which means? 
I'll be in here every day. 
Soaking it up. 
So please return to work, and act like I'm not here. 
Okay. 
Let's, uh, get into Toofer's commercial parody. 
We were trying to think of a funnier cereal name. 
The favorite options so far include Honey Bunches of Sadness, Oat Bung, and Swaztik-o's. 
Fruit Lupus. 
No. 
Dingleberries. 
Fart Nuggets. 
I'm sorry. 
That's really great. 
Okay, let's just think for another minute. 
Frosted Mini Guns. 
Lucky Bastards? 
If you don't mind, I think we all really laughed at Fart Nuggets, so could we just move on, please. 
Every day, huh? 
You guys want coffee? 
Oh, yeah. 
So I was doing some research on comedy. 
And I came across the cartoon strip Dilbert. 
It's quite good. 
And I was wondering if we could do that. 
Do what? 
Dilbert. 
You guys want coffee? 
Oh, yeah. 
No, no, no, you can't say that. 
Jeb Bush is a friend of mine. 
Who should I change it to? 
Sean Penn No, Barbra Streisand. 
He guns it. 
Girl falls into the water. 
You guys want coffee? 
So we circle back  looking for her. 
Remember, it's pitch black out. 
The boat hits something hard. 
And you hear kind of... 
And Brokaw says, "Just go. 
Don't look back." 
Now...I'm not a writer, 
but maybe there's a skit in that. 
Hey. What? 
So is Donaghy gonna be in the room again today? 
Ugh. Probably, yeah. 
Well, you have to say something to him. 
You  guys are not getting any work done. 
Really? 
You don't think his idea of starting with the catchphrases and working backwards is panning out? 
"Nuts to you, McGullicuty." 
"Who ordered the wieners?" 
Beep beep! 
Ribby ribby! 
Actually, Frank wrote a draft of "Beep beep, ribby ribby." 
Look, you have to say something to Jack soon, or your writers are going to revolt. 
What do you all not understand? 
He's our boss. 
Me trying to tell Jack what to do would be like you trying to boss around Which one of your kids is it that you're afraid of? 
Kyle. 
Kyle. 
So strong. 
Oh, come on! 
That was a jacket. 
That's it, I've gotta talk to her about her clothes. 
She can't dress like that. 
Yes, she can. 
People like the way she dresses. 
Oh, come on, it's distracting. 
It's inappropriate. 
You're inappropriate, you jerk, with your big stupid face! 
 Come on. 
 Liz, listen, listen, listen. 
Look at me. 
Look how bald I am. 
Look at my life. 
Please, just give me this one thing. 
Pete, no, come on! 
I'm talking to her. 
Talk to yourself! 
Cha! 
Kenny, my boy. 
What's the frequency, Ken? 
Yeah, I need you to grab me some lunch. 
Absolutely. 
What can I get for you? 
 I want nachos. 
 Yes, sir. 
From Yankee Stadium. 
Yes, sir! 
General  testing for United Nations Bloopers. 
Oh, hey, Cerie. 
Kind of need to talk to you about something. 
Do you have a second? 
Sure. 
Okay, this is gonna sound really weird, but, um...you need to wear a bra. 
Oh, no, I don't actually. 
They kind of just stay up on their own. 
See? Yeah, okay. 
What I'm saying is, you need to wear a bra to work if you want to be taken seriously in this business. 
No, but I don't actually want to work in television. 
Career-wise, I'm just gonna marry rich and then design handbags. 
Here's the thing. 
The way that you dress is making some people around the office uncomfortable. 
Really? 
Who? 
Not me! 
I guess it's mostly me that has the problem with it. 
Oh, because you have, like, one of those body image things? 
No, it's not that. 
Good, because I was gonna say you still have a good body. 
Well, thank you, but this isn't about me. 
Like, how did you dress before you were married? 
I'm not married, Cerie. 
Oh, for some reason, I thought you had, like, three kids. 
Nope. 
Never married, no kids. 
'Cause sometimes you have, like, food stains on your shirt and stuff. 
I just assumed that it was kids. 
You know what? 
Forget I mentioned it. 
You look great. 
Is it my birthday? 
You have to get Donaghy out of the room. 
Boy, we as a group might not smell great. 
Come on, he's stifling us. 
I feel like I just can't be myself around him. 
Yeah, Tracy's downstairs right now rehearsing the best thing we've written all week. 
Beep beep! Ribby ribby! 
All right. 
Ugh. 
All right. 
I'll take care of it. 
Thanks, Liz. 
Hey, Mr. Donaghy. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I was at a luncheon for Ann Coulter's 60th birthday. 
Oh, yeah. 
Listen, it's been really great having you in the room these last few days Oh, it's been great for me, too. 
Being around all this creativity. 
I'll tell you, in the beginning I thought it was gonna be a bit of a chore honestly, but now Oh, I have an idea for you. 
Monkey Senate. 
We open on the Capitol You can't be in here anymore! 
What's that? 
It's not working. 
You're driving everybody crazy. 
And, okay, you can just fire me now, and I will go back to teaching improv to senior citizens. 
Why would I want to fire you? 
This is fine. 
Six Sigma values direct and honest communication between coworkers, so, uh... 
Thank you, Liz. 
Oh, sure. 
I'll just, uh, head upstairs now. 
Okay, well, thank you for being so understanding. 
Absolutely. 
Oh, no. 
I will not let you down, sir. 
Go get help, girl. 
Hey, Jonathan, I left a bunch of messages for Jack, but I haven't heard back. 
Do you know if he got them? 
Mr. Donaghy's been very busy. 
Well, I just--I really need him to approve this budget. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
He's out of the country till the end of the week. 
You  want to know another key to success? 
I do, Mr. Jordan. 
Dress every day like you're gonna get murdered in those clothes. 
You did real good the other day with those nachos, but I need you to do something of a different nature. 
Would you agree when I say that a man's freedom only exists when he's free to pursue his desires? 
Yes, I suppose I would. 
Which means when the law conflicts with our desires, then we must operate outside the law. 
You following me? 
Otherwise, we would no longer be free. 
Now I got a mission for you. 
Hey, Liz! 
I took your advice. 
I'm wearing a bra. 
That's great, Cerie. 
Uh, Liz, can I speak to you for a second? 
Sure. 
What's going on? 
Mr. Donaghy is very upset 
that you banned him from the writers' room. 
He wants you to apologize. 
Really? 
But when you apologize, you have to act like it was your idea. 
He can't know that I told you. 
But he sent you here to tell me to apologize. 
Exactly. 
I penciled you in for 3:00. 
This conversation never happened. 
Jenna, set yourself, please, for Who Wants to Eat a Dictionary? 
Where's Kenneth? 
Who is it? 
It's Kenneth from the NBC page program. 
I'm here for a pickup from Qiang Deng. 
Hello, gentlemen. 
Oh, thank goodness. 
Air conditioning. 
Ooh, what does that tattoo mean? 
When I get nervous, I ask a lot of questions. 
Do y'all have a bathroom I could use? 
Y'all have long fingernails. 
Now do y'all rent this space,  or do you own it? 
Hey, that's a funny-looking fish. 
What is that, like a grapefruit knife? 
Do you have a cell phone? 
What's your plan? 
This apology thing is interesting. 
Ugh, even when it's something normal I hate going up to Jack's office. 
I always feel like I'm entering the Death Star. 
I expect to see Stormtroopers. 
I tell you, if Donaghy does this at me, I  will run. 
You'll be fine... 
Captain Needa. 
No, Captain Needa dies. 
He dies! 
* There's no business like show business * * Like no business I know * Everything about it is appealing * * Everything the traffic will allow * * Nowhere can you get that special feeling * * Than when you're stealing that extra bow * What can I do for you? 
I'm on a helicopter in 15 minutes. 
Uh, well, sir, I just wanted to say, um, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings the other day when I asked you to stay out of the writers' room. 
That's absurd. 
Completely unnecessary. 
I haven't given it a second thought. 
Okay, good, 'cause, you know, the writers, they see you as management Please, it's water under the bridge. 
Stop worrying and just go on back to work. 
Of course, I can understand how you might think my feelings were hurt. 
No one wants to hear that people don't like you. 
What, no? 
No, that's not at all what I was saying before. 
I never said that people don't like you. 
That's not true. 
So, people do like me? 
Yes, people like you. 
Do you like me? 
Of course. 
I like you. 
Jack. 
You know what I like about you? 
Mmm. 
Your eyes. 
You have those black shark's eyes. 
You know? 
Very intense. 
Thank you. 
Anyway... 
You done good, kid. 
That thing ever goes missing and gets into the public water system, we don't know each other. 
Got it. 
I got one little errand for you to run. 
Tomorrow's my anniversary, and I almost forgot about it. 
But what did I tell you was the secret to having a good marriage and keeping it together, Kenneth? 
Be a good listener, a giver of gifts, and work that va-jay-jay. 
That's my boy! 
That's why I want you to go see my jeweler. 
Good morning, Liz. 
Oh, hi, Mr. Donaghy. 
How are you? 
Fine, thank you. 
I remember you mentioning what a big fan you are of the rapper Chamillionaire. 
'Cause I was dancing with Frank? 
Oh, yes, yeah. 
I love Chamillionaire. 
Well, it just so happens that he's performing this weekend at Webster Hall, and I got some VIP tickets and backstage passes. 
You could take the writers or a lady friend. 
Whatever. 
Enjoy yourself. 
You deserve it. 
Wow. Thank you. 
That's very thoughtful. 
Well, I think that coworkers should have good personal relationships. 
I know we've had some missteps, but we've put all that behind us. 
And I'd like us to be... 
friendly. 
Yeah, absolutely. 
Yes, so do I. 
Wow, I just can't believe Chamillionaire tickets were still available. 
Ah, well. 
See ya. 
Josh to stage, please, for Homophobic Hague. 
What was that about? 
Just talking to my "bud," Jack Donaghy. 
Bud, really? 
Yes, he said he wants us to be friends. 
He gave me Chamillionaire tickets. 
And he even did this to me. 
Wow, look, having Jack on your side can only make life easier. 
It's good for everybody if he wants to be friends. 
I know, but it's so weird. 
It's like that scene where you see the back of Darth Vader's head with his helmet off, and you're like, "Oh! He's a human being!" 
I gotta get some new DVDs. 
Did we just go in a circle? 
Yeah. I was following you. 
I was following you. 
No, I'm going to wardrobe. 
Okay, good walk and talk. 
Lee, can I check costumes for the cold open? 
That looks fierce. 
Hey, Liz. 
Cerie, seriously, take that off. 
And you, stop encouraging her. 
You're an enabler. 
You need to dress like you have a job. 
And parents who raised you in some kind of shamed-based American religious tradition. 
Here. 
I can make this hot. 
Now I get to pick out what I think you'd look good in. 
Oh, I'm not really a fashion person. 
You're wearing this. 
Come on, no. 
I'm serious. 
This color would be amazing on you. 
And you're a size four, right? 
Well, aren't you sweet? 
Hey, guys, what's up? 
Ugh! Oh, my God! 
What are you wearing?! 
You're making me gay. 
It's a joke, obviously. 
I'm wearing this as a joke! 
Bunch of comedy writers don't know a joke, jeez. 
I just threw up in my mouth. 
I said it's a joke! 
Work it, Craig! Whoo! 
I think I'm having a heart attack. 
Excellent, right here. 
Thank you. 
Oh, pizza! 
Thank you, sir. 
Hey, Liz, can we eat this out on the roof gardens? 
I don't even know how to get out there. 
I don't think people are allowed out there. 
No, I see Today Show people  eating out there all the time. 
Really? 
Even Ann Curry? 
I'll show you the studio in just a minute, but first, this is where my writers write. 
Don't mind the odor. 
But seriously, since Tracy's arrival the show is up in the key demos. 
We're driving male viewership, and we're effectively synergizing backward overflow. 
Please, Liz, let us eat outside. 
You know what? 
I'll ask Jack. 
He'll  let us eat out there, right? 
He and I have an important friendship. 
Hey, they didn't bring any sodas. 
I'll call Kenneth. 
Seriously, where is Kenneth? 
Happy anniversary, Mrs. Jordan. 
Excuse me, do y'all just have noodles with butter? 
Hey, Jack! 
Sorry to interrupt. 
Hey, can we eat our pizza outside? 
'Cause those wangs from the Today Show eat on the roof garden all the time, and, you know, since I thought me and you are best buds--boink! 
Maybe you could do me a solid and slip me the key to that thing. 
This guy's the best. 
He got me kick-ass Chamillionaire tickets. 
You guys like Chamillionaire? 
Anyway, Jack rocks. 
This guy, A-plus. 
Excuse me for a moment. 
I'm sorry for what's about to happen right now. 
Just know that I don't mean it. 
Don't mean what? 
What group home did you escape from that you would dare talk to me like some plumber's wife in front of Ron Gordon and Bob Overmeyer? 
I don't even know who those guys are. 
Oh, really? 
Your ignorance was obvious when you waddled up to me with your thin-lipped mouth full of greasy peasant food and addressed me by my Christian name in front of the gentlemen from Fairfield. 
That's Fairfield, Connecticut, Lemon. 
GE Headquarters. 
But how would you know that with your nigh-40 years of public education and daytime television viewing? 
If you ever pull a bush league stunt like that again, I'm gonna have you writing promos for Arena Football so fast it'll make your inexplicably small head spin. 
Oh, snap. 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
I thought you said we were friends. 
I said we were friendly. 
Well, I don't like you anymore. 
I don't believe you. 
Go easy on the pizza. 
Subs by Raceman and Traff  Hey  Hi, babe. 
Dennis, what are you doing? 
I'm gonna mount a TV on your wall. 
I just can't find a stud. 
So you made nine holes in my wall? 
No, those are for the shelves, dummy. 
The TV is gonna go right here. 
It's gonna be awesome. 
It's gonna be It's gonna be like a hospital. 
Oh, Dennis, I don't want a hospital TV. 
I don't want a shelf... 
Whose horse is that? 
That's my cousin Teddy's Great Dane. 
I told him I'd watch him for a couple weeks. 
'cause Teddy broke his ankle running from some black guys that pulled a gun on him. 
Now, why is it important to tell me that the muggers were black? 
They weren't muggers. 
They were cops. 
So why don't you just say he was running from some cops? 
I don't know, I mean, you're a racist for assuming that they weren't cops. 
Uhh! 
You know I'm allergic to dogs. 
Ack, allergies are all mental. 
Hey. 
Who the hell is this? 
That's Teddy. 
Get out. 
I want you out of here! 
You can't kick me out. 
I love you! 
No, no, get your stuff and get out. 
I'm not doing this anymore. 
You can't kick me out. 
I got squatter's rights. 
Which is it: you love me or you got squatter's rights? 
I don't see why they're mutually exclusive! 
Ohh! 
Thank you. 
Oh, Liz, finally. 
It's about time you broke up with him. 
He's a comple loser. 
Oh, Jenna, don't say that. 
You know, he had some good moments. 
Hi. 
I got donuts. 
What's up, brown eyes? 
I made chili. 
Hey... 
You wanna... 
wanna order cheese steaks? 
I guess they were mostly food related. 
But he was always nice to me. 
Oh, that's okay. 
Cry it out, sister. 
No, I'm not crying. 
I'm allergic to the stupid Great Dane. 
That thing licked my eyes this morning. 
Wait a minute. 
Dennis and the dog are still in your apartment? 
I gave him a week to find a new place. 
Ugh. 
We're completely broken up. 
If that's true, then I'm taking you out to celebrate. 
A girls' night. 
We'll meet some new people. 
Oh, you mean like at a discotheque? 
Oh, boy. 
So when can we see each other again? 
What are you wearing? 
Black dress? 
Black stockings? 
A funeral, oh. 
I'm sorry, okay. 
Let me call you back in an hour... yeah, bye. 
Why are you cryig? 
The Liberty lose again last night? 
I'm not crying. 
I have allergies. 
Allergies are all in the mind, Lemon. 
I use to have a wicked peanut allergy. 
And now, witness. 
As I'm sure you surmised from that call, I'm seeing a woman of late. 
Yeah, who's the lucky lady? 
Let's just say she's a high-ranking African-American member of the Bush administration. 
Are you dating Condoleeza Rice? 
I'm not at liberty to say. 
The point is, my lady friend is an egghead, much like yourself. 
 Not my usual thing, and I need your advice. 
We're having a lot of trouble connecting lately. 
She does a lot of traveling. 
Yeah, and it must be hard for her to get cell phone reception when she's so far up the president's butt. 
I'm choosing to ignore that remark on the basis that you are a godless, glassy-eyed Clintonista. 
Now, I wanted to get my friend something personal. 
Do you think she would prefer this handsome attach�, which says, "You are a woman of substance, and I respect you,"  or... 
this collection of ladies' unmentionables with snaps and openings all over the place? 
Attach�! 
I see, okay. 
Jenna to the floor, please. 
Yeah, it's pretty good. 
But I think the boobs  should swing more. 
Yeah, then I could go: Rodney, don't make me come over there and beat you in the head with one of my boom-booms!" 
Yeah. 
This is just appalling. 
What's your problem? 
I just think it's demeaning for a black man to do drag. 
What? Everybody loves 
a dude in a dress. 
I mean, those are the best Bugs Bunnies. 
Frank, there are large pockets of African-American culture that  Caucasians know nothing about. 
The stigma of drag is one of them. 
Whatever. 
I've played a woman before. 
 Hunky Grandma Be Trippin' made $96 million. 
All I'm saying is is drag is a way for Caucasians to emasculate you and make you seem non-threatening. 
We never would have stooped so low on Black Frasier. 
Black Frasier? 
Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable. 
It's both fruity and precocious. 
That's not the only thing around here that's fruity and precocious. 
I never heard of Black Frasier. 
What? 
It was huge on BET. 
Every Thursday night at about 9:00 or 9:15. 
Think about it, Tracy. 
All the best African-American comedians refuse to do drag. 
Chris Rock doesn't do it. 
Dr. Cosby doesn't do it. 
Bernie Mac doesn't do it 'cause he'd be ugly as hell. 
Forget it. 
I'm not wearing this dress. 
It's prejudicial. 
Thanks a lot. 
Now what am I supposed to do with this sketch? 
I'll do it. 
I mean, my parents raised me as a girl for, like, ten years. 
What? 
I told you guys that. 
That's our show for tonight! 
See you next week! 
Good night! 
That's okay, we'll think of something. 
All right, I'll see you. 
Monday night is girls' night. 
I'm taking you out, 9:30. 
I know this great karaoke place where you can get a pedicure while you sing. 
Oh, Jenna, I'll go anywhere. 
Just,  please, no more karaoke. 
Not after our last duet. 
When I'm right here, you need to be here. 
Not here. 
Here is embarrassing. 
Okay, fine. 
I didn't say that. 
I said you're a beautiful woman. 
It wouldn't hurt to try something different with your hair. 
Check this out. 
I think Jack is dating Condi Rice. 
Oh, God, that's huge! 
Oh, no, no. 
I never said braces. 
I said bonding. 
Dude, that Shamanda character was the best thing of the night.. 
What was her line? 
Say it again. 
Rodney! 
Don't make me come over there and beat on you with my boom-booms! 
You burned me! 
There's nothing wrong with a black comedian wearing a dress. 
Eddie does it, Martin does it, Jamie Foxx, Flip Wilson. 
Whoopi Goldberg does it every day! 
You stole a franchise from me! 
Shamanda could have been a movie! 
Okay, you need to write something great for him before this becomes a problem. 
I wouldn't even know where to begin writing for a guy like that. 
Then write something with him. 
Our comedy gotta do more than make people laugh. 
Gotta make people think. 
I wanna hold a mirror up to society, and then win world record for biggest mirror. 
He's totally right. 
Gotta be raw! 
Uh-huh. 
I got a concept for a sketch I think you might like. 
You and Jenna play Sleestaks from Land of the Lost and you're trying to get a small business loan. 
What? 
Because you want to open up a pancake house called Slee's Stacks. 
Are you black? 
Jack, is everything all right? 
I think I figured out why things have been so rocky with my lady friend. 
I'm on the street. 
I can barely hear you. 
She's cheating on me, Liz. 
I think there's another man in the picture. 
Are you sure, Jack? 
'Cause she kind of seems like an honest lady. 
I know what I know. 
Next time I see Putin, I'm gonna kick his teeth in. 
Oh, here it is! 
Izzle. 
"A suffix that can be used to take the place of anything." 
Well, now you're just being patronizzle. 
You know who would love this argument? 
My racist grandfather. 
I thought writing with you was gonna be like two brothers writing together. 
We're not even speaking the same language. 
That's right. 
I'm speaking English. 
Just listen, just listen. 
 Come on, who raised you? 
Standing there with your pants that fit. 
Using a wallet. 
Drinking Starbucks. 
And what is this? 
That's my Harvard a capella group the Crocodillos. 
I had a solo in Like A Prayer. 
Come on! 
Where's your heritage? 
My brother! 
My homeboy! 
My n Hey, sorry I'm late. 
Thank God you're here. 
This place is creeping me out. 
I don't think I can do this. 
You're gonna be great. 
They're cute. 
Do  you think they're Wall Street guys? 
Yeah, I think they're from the firm of Date-Rape, Coke-ington Cheeseball, and Jag. 
You've got to give this a chance. 
Excuse me. 
Is this seat taken? 
Oh, really, dude? 
I gotta move my coat? 
There's like four empty seats down there. 
Can't you just be cool? 
Ugh. 
That guy wanted to buy you a drink. 
Really? 
I already have a drink. 
Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks? 
What is the matter with you? 
I don't know! 
I'm just nervous and rusty. 
Well, just relax and be yourself. 
Can I have a martini, please? 
Hi. 
Oh, he knows where Bin Laden is, come on! 
The Carlyle Group. 
The Unocal Pipeline. 
The assassination of Olof Palme. 
Come on, the proof is in the pudding. 
Ooh, these are good. 
Really, you think she looks like Jessica Simpson? 
You could put a long, blonde wig on a ferret and it would like Jessica Simpson. 
And by the way, Jessica Simpson would think that you are old and gross. 
 So good luck with that. 
I really didn't think I was gonna meet anybody tonight, but you and I have so much in common. 
Also, you have really pretty eyes. 
Oh, hi. 
I learned the truth at seventeen. 
That love was meant for beauty queens. 
Hey, you're bumming us out. 
And high school girls with clear skin smiles. 
Who married young and then retired. 
Whoa I thought bars were open till 4:00. 
Nope, 11:30. 
Let's get you to bed. 
... from human resources. 
Hi. 
He told me that Toofer filed the harassment complaint against Tracy. 
What? 
Now I have to attend  sensitivity training. 
What seems to be the problem, Toofer? 
Mr. Jordan called me... 
the N-word. 
And? 
And I was really offended. 
Because... 
Because it's a racial slur. 
Brothers talk to other brothers like that. 
I was being friendly. 
  Yes, Toofer. 
You see, in the last decade or so the African-American community has re-appropriated that word as a way of depriving it of its meaning. 
Just don't try to tell my girlfriend that. 
Yeah, Toofer, I really don't think Tracy was trying to offend you. 
It's okay for us to use it with each other. 
You can call me that. 
It's a term of endearment. 
Look, I'm not trying to cause any trouble. 
And I confess I appreciate what you do for the show. 
I want you to be my brother, my homeboy, my n Whoa! 
This meeting is adjourned. 
No cool, homie! 
You might as well spread me down with a fire hose. 
Just sounds so hateful coming from you! Ugh! 
I wish to file a complaint. 
Hey. 
Dennis, what are you doing here? 
Hey, I'm moving into my new apartment. 
So I got one last thing to say to you, and then I'll be out of your life forever. 
"Dear Liz Lemon, "While other women have bigger boobs than you, "no woman has as big a heart. 
"When I saw you getting ready to go out "and get nailed by a bunch of guys last night, "I knew for sure it was over between us. 
"And for the first time since the '86 World Series, I cried". 
"I cried like a big dumb homo". 
"And if it was up to me, we would be together forever. 
"But there's a new thing called 'women's liberation' "which gives you women the right to choose, "and you have chosen to abort me. 
"And that I must live with. 
"So tonight when you arrive home, I'll be gone. 
I officially renounced my squatter's rights." 
I'll always love you. 
Good-bye and good luck. 
I'll never forget you. 
And that is why we are no longer a couple. 
The guy just came in here and bared his soul to you. 
What are you, made of stone? 
Am I crazy? 
The guy's a disaster, right? 
Well, I don't know. 
I mean, yeah, he's a little "bridge and tunnel," but you did say you had some good times. 
No, no, no, he had his bad moments too. 
Hey. 
Threesome? 
How about it, huh? 
Mmm! 
I'm just saying... 
after last night... 
maybe he's not such a bad choice. 
You are suggesting that I get back with Dennis. 
Maybe. 
Look, you're a writer. 
Write a list of Dennis' pros and cons. 
It's a very helpful exercise. 
It's how I decided to get a scooter instead of a bike. 
Ah. 
Well, you have to admit there's always time for Tony Blair. 
There's always time for Bashar al-Assad. 
But there's never any time for Jack Donaghy, and that's a problem. 
Go ahead, take the call, yeah. 
Hey, Dennis, you drop by to say hi to Liz? 
You mean the ex-future Mrs. Dennis? 
She dumped me again. 
I'm sorry to hear that. 
Yeah, you know, you try to make some people happy, but it doesn't work all the time. 
Tell me about it. 
What, you? 
I really can't go into detail. 
It's about when my woman and I are together, it's mindblowing. 
It's, uh... 
It's filthy, really. 
So what's the problem? 
Well, she works all the time. 
She's always traveling, it's a headache. 
Who needs that? 
That's why I'm always dating 20-year-olds. 
Nah, let me tell you about 20-year-olds, my friend. 
Half of them are 16. 
You want some advice? 
It's hard for alpha males like you and me to put our egos aside, but if she's worth it, you make it work. 
It's like my cousin Teddy's dog. 
Sometimes he just doesn't wanna lick my feet. 
So what I do is, I hide my feet from him for a couple of days, and then when he sees them, he goes bananas. 
So Jack, in this example, Liz is the dog. 
And I am my feet. 
You see what I'm saying? 
Yes, I believe I do. 
Each of you is here because you are insensitive to a co-worker, okay? 
You might've used one of the words I call the "uh-oh" words. 
Such as, slut. 
Ho. 
Uh, bitch. 
Biyatch. 
Queerburger. 
Faggotron. 
Gaybird. 
Uh, the word for black in any language, N�ro, noir, schwartz, negro, kam-an-sek. 
Hmm? 
So. 
What else? 
What else can we not call each other? 
How 'bout sweaty greaseball? 
Ooh, very good. 
That's highly offensive. 
Person of color. 
Guess if you say it like that. 
Sneaky Taiwanese tranny who stole my watch. 
Ho-ho! 
Yes! 
These words are terrible. 
But today, we are going to learn to communicate in a different way. 
And I would like to start with Tracy and James. 
Guys? 
Now, I understand that the two of you got into a big 'ol conflict yesterday. 
And...let's work this out. 
Tracy. 
What did you really want to say to James? 
I'm tryin' to tell him he's my brother. 
We're the only two blacks  on the show. 
We have to figure out a way to work together. 
Like professor Martin Luther King said, I have a feeling. 
It's Dr. Martin Luther King, 
and he did not have a feeling, he had a dream. 
Ah, dude wear khakis. 
Uncle Tom, party of one. 
Uncle Tom, party of one. 
You can't call someone that if you've never read the book! 
What  book? 
You know what I think? 
I think you're ashamed of being black, and you're an embarrassment to your community! 
I embarrass you. 
You embarrass me, and you know why? 
Because there are racist people in this world, and when they see you act like a fool, they assume we're all fools. 
That's it! 
This is it. 
This is the sketch we should do. 
What? 
Right here, you and me! 
This is deep stuff goin' on. 
We gotta write this. 
You're right. 
Ah-ha-ha! 
Dr. Snoo, 
thank you very much! 
Smew. 
Oh. Oh. 
Okay. 
That's really against the rules. 
Dennis? 
Oh, my God. 
"I know this might be emotional for you, so there's a meatball sub in the fridge." 
Oh! 
"Pro. 
Fixed TV." 
Huh. 
Hello, I'm Star Jones. 
And welcome to the Star Jones Gastric Bypass Cooking Show. 
Mmm. 
Liz, what happened to the race relations sketch Tracy and I wrote? 
Oh, we only had time for one more bit, and Tracy picked this. I'm sorry. 
Now you know, I can only eat small portions. 
Oh, my goodness! 
Dessert. 
Okay, he's right, this is funnier. 
 Guess where I was last night. 
 Mark Foley's pajama party. 
No. 
Kandahar. 
Afghanistan? 
Yeah. 
Took the corporate jet to hook up with my neo-con inamorata. 
Well, I'm glad things are working out for you and your mystery lady. 
Well actually, they're not. 
I broke up with her. 
Really? 
What happened? 
Well, I finally realized that we're not compatible. 
I mean, I'm all for fantasy role-play, but Abu-Ghraib? 
Well, you know, relationships end. 
People...move on. 
But I'm glad at least I gave it a shot. 
Thank Dennis for making me do that. 
Dennis? 
Yep. 
You know, I might've been too hard on that guy. 
He's okay. 
Hmm. 
"Jack likes Dennis. 
"Jack likes Dennis." 
At Snapple, when young fruit ripens, they may want to combine with other fruit. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
I just, um, just wanted to drop off your Christmas present. 
I had already bought it for you, so... 
Oh... 
It's a fancy briefcase, you know, 'cause you're classy and important. 
Like a dude. 
Thank you, Dennis. 
I, uh, also got you some antihistamine. 
In case the next guy you're with, you know, has a dog and you wanna stay with him. 
Anyway. 
Do wanna eat? 
What? 
I got all this Chinese food. 
I'm never gonna finish it by myself, so... 
For real? 
Should I, um, grab a plate? 
Yeah. 
Get me a diet soda. 
Okay. 
Good evening and welcome to Dateline. 
Chris Hansen has our latest investigation Hello? 
Good evening, sir. 
I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC. 
Can I ask you what you're doing here tonight? 
Oh, yeah, I'm here to boff some chick named Mary. 
Boff some chick Oh, my God. 
Do you know how old Mary is? 
Yeah, uh, 22. 
I think. 
You wanna try again? 
Crap. 
That girl said she was 16, but I swear to God I could tell she was 22. 
Get out of my apartment! 
This happened while we were broken up. 
No, no, no, no. 
I was right about you! 
This is a con, by the way. 
You on Dateline is a con! 
You know what? 
I knew you wouldn't be cool about this. 
We're finished. 
You can't break up with me. 
I already broke up with you! 
Fine! 
Then we agree to disagree! 
Subs by Raceman and Traff| Hey. 
 Hey.| Wow. 
Hot dog times, huh? 
I only eat them on special occasions. 
What's the special occasion? 
I decided to eat one. 
Fair enough. 
You going this way? 
Uh, no, I'm going in here, actually. 
 I'll see you later.| Okay, bye. 
Church on a Tuesday? 
But he seemed so normal. 
I know, right? 
And, uh, this is Kenneth, one of our pages. Kenneth, this is Devin Banks, 
our Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content and Theme Park Talent Relations. 
Hey, Devin, you better watch out,|Kenneth might take your job one day. 
Or your job, Jack. 
Or his job! 
Why don't we just, uh  Devin.| Yeah. 
Morning.|My notes. 
Ugh, dude, how can we be|wearing the same outfit? 
You saw me leave|the apartment this morning. 
I saw you put it on and|I thought it looked nice. 
How long are you staying with me? 
Indefinitely. 
Huh. 
Liz, I want you to meet Devin Banks. 
He's in from L.A. 
Devin, this is Lemon. 
 Hi.| Hi. 
 Love the show.| Thank you. 
Look, I gotta go.|Thanks for the tour. 
You guys... you're the real heroes. 
They get younger every year. 
These punks who think|they can take down Jack Donaghy. 
You're worried about that guy? 
Banks is in New York for a reason,|and I intend to send him back to L.A. 
Wow, if this turns into a showdown,|you guys could settle it with a talking like this contest. 
Banks is no slouch. 
He pioneered the concept|of ten second internet sitcoms. 
* Making it happen Honey, I'm home. 
Oh, great. 
* We made it I'm sure he's here to dazzle the old men|with his webisode ideas, but I have ideas too, Lemon. 
Like what? 
Something big. 
A live television special with fireworks. 
They can do shapes now. 
One time, I saw a cowboy hat. 
Boom, boom, boom. 
Boy, you're gonna need more than that though. 
Maybe you're right. 
I want you on this, Lemon. 
Those jokes you wrote for my Mitt Romney|fundraiser, they were top-notch. 
Those weren't jokes. 
That was an appeal for|a return to common sense and decency. 
Well, it got big laughs. 
Yeah, we should do a sketch|about alien abductions. 
Yeah. 
Like a Lamaze class in Roswell. 
Lamazewell. 
Dude, what's with|the ridiculous hat and glasses? 
I'm incognito. 
Some dude is trying to slap me|with a subpoena for a paternity suit. 
But the kid ain't mine. 
How do you know it's not your child? 
'Cause I remember|that girl and it's impossible. 
I never got out of my car and she never got|all the way out of her tollbooth! 
Okay. 
Let's get back to work, guys. 
How about a sketch|about Bill Clinton eating hamburgers? 
That stinks.|What is this, 1992? 
Eh, what do you want from me? 
I'm not a comedy writer. 
Wha--? 
Mr. Jordan... 
you've been served. 
You know, the more I think about it, the more jazzed I'm getting|about these fireworks. 
Maybe don't pitch|the fireworks thing right away. 
I'm gonna come up with a couple other things|I think you'll like better. 
Well, what I'm saying is, that is what we're selling|at the pitch meeting, Lemon: spectacle. 
It's what people want.|The Romans knew it. 
Louis XIV knew it.|Wolfowitz knows it. 
Mr. Donaghy. 
As instructed,|I was spying on Mr. Banks. 
And there's something|you should know. 
So... 
what team do you play for? 
Oh, it's not really a team. 
It's just a bunch of guys|who like doing gymnastics. 
You know... 
I'm gonna be in town|for a little while. 
Maybe we could... get together. 
My, you're friendly! 
Good God. 
Devin is gay. 
He's even more powerful|than I thought. 
Maybe you should seduce him and get him to tell you|all his secret plans. 
So Mr. Donaghy,|what can I do for you? 
I heard you were talking|with my colleague Devin Banks. 
Did he tell you|why he was in New York? 
No, sir, we just talked|about Anderson Cooper mostly. 
You should get to know Devin. 
Tell him all of your television ideas. 
You know, he started off|as a page just like you. 
Really? So did I! 
You say the right things,|ask him the right questions, I'm sure he could open|some doors for you. 
Okay. What kinds of questions? 
I'll write them down for you. 
You call him, tell him you got two tickets|for A Chorus Line for tonight. 
And, uh...Kenneth... 
Have you ever used bronzer? 
Dr. Spaceman, when they check my DNA, 
will they tell me|what diseases I might get or help me to remember|my ATM pin code? 
Absolutely. 
Science is whatever|we want it to be. 
I'll let you know|as soon as I have the results. 
I already know the results.|The kid is not mine. 
Boy, it's crazy to think we used to|settle questions of paternity by dunking a woman in water|until she admitted she made it all up. 
Mm...different time, the '60s. 
But he was going to church|in the middle of the day on a Tuesday. 
What do you think that means? 
It means he probably murdered someone|and found God while he was in jail. 
Maybe he's born-again? Ugh, boy. 
We'll spend our Saturdays in Central Park|trying to "save" gay rollerbladers. 
I just wish people would tell you|immediately when you meet them, "Hi, I am so and so.|Here's all the weird stuff about me." 
Ah, that would never work. 
If I told my wife in college,|"Hey, I'm gonna lose all this beautiful hair and fart in my sleep|for the next 20 years," she never would have married me. 
Love is like an onion, and you peel away layer|after stinky layer until you're just...|weeping over the sink. 
Is that my sweatshirt? 
Hey! 
Oh...sorry. 
No, no-- Ugh! 
And I have an idea for a show|about a teacher named Art. 
I call that one "Art School." 
And one about a Jewish guy|who opens an ice cream parlor. 
That one's called "Ice Cream Cohen." 
And a drama about two cops,|one named Cash and one named Carry. 
I don't have a title for that one. 
 But then also| Kenneth. 
Can I offer you a libation? 
 I have champagne, vodka, absinthe| Fruit punch, please. 
Right. 
You'll excuse me. 
I'll go slip into something|a little more comfortable. 
Like in the movies! 
So Mr. Banks... 
what brings you to New York? 
Oh, just making the rounds. 
Hmm. 
What projects are you working on|near-slash-long term? 
Oh my. That's an awful short robe. 
I know. 
I had to cut it down myself. 
Oh, Kenneth. 
You know, I was a page. 
And when I was in the program,|we'd give each other a hand. 
Can you give me a hand, Kenneth? 
For a fellow page, anything! 
Great. 
Tell me about Jack Donaghy. 
Tracy, I have the results|of your DNA test. 
Now, I'm very serious about|doctor/patient confidentiality... 
so I'm gonna have to ask|at all four of us keep this to ourselves. 
What's the verdict, Doc? 
Good news. 
You are not the father of that child. 
 Yeah!| However, according to my DNA database, 
you are a direct descendant|of our third president. 
Jasper Buceman? 
No, Tracy. 
Our third president.|Thomas Jefferson. 
Jefferson? Not possible. 
Yeah, that's a white dude. 
Yeah, but that guy was into black chicks. 
I'm surprised I am not a descendant. 
These DNA results show|that genetically you're mostly white. 
That ridiculous. 
I can't be white. 
My whole persona is based|on an in-depth analysis of the differences between|black and white. 
This is how black people dial a phone. 
* Boop ood a-boop a-doop a-doop whoop * This is how white people dial a phone. 
I gotta call my wife. 
Devin. 
What can I do for you? 
I think we're way past that, Jack. 
Let's be honest with each other. 
I'll go first. 
I'm gay|and I want your job. 
Devin, I'm straighter than you are gay and I leave particles of guys|like you in my wind. 
I'm not afraid of you. 
Yeah, well, you should be. 
Lets just see how little|shakes out in the meeting. 
Yeah... 
let's. 
Oh, by the way, a little slim-waisted birdie|in a page jacket told me you got nothing. 
You're going down. 
No, Devin. 
I don't do that. 
No, no, no. 
Are you kidding me? 
You eat too many hot dogs. 
Please, I am concerned. 
I copied this article on sodium for you. 
Fine. 
But I will be reporting this|to the Fox Problem Solvers. 
Oh, boy. 
What is this, Bible study? 
Excuse me one second. 
 Hey.| Hi. 
I didn't know you came here. 
Oh, well, I haven't been|in a super long time. 
But, yeah, my parents used to|make me go every week. 
Wow. 
Well, welcome back. 
Thanks. 
You're doing the right thing. 
Go ahead, have a seat. 
Okay, everybody.|Let's get started. 
Hi, my name is Floyd|and I'm an alcoholic. 
Hi, Floyd. 
Hi, Floyd. Uh... 
It's been four years since my last drink. 
But I just broke up with|my girlfriend, so I guess today I'll be talking about|my issues with women and trust. 
The dishonesty that my dad... 
You stayed? 
Pete, you don't understand. 
He was pouring his guts out. 
It was like eavesdropping|on somebody else's therapy. 
It was great. 
Yeah, that's not okay. 
But I just feel like|I've known him forever now, you know? 
I mean, his father was awful. 
Awful. 
And he told this story|about trying to make French toast for his mom when he was a kid|and he started crying! 
I love him. 
Liz, what is your plan here?|What are you gonna do? 
You're gonna fake being an alcoholic|for the rest of your life? 
I don't know, okay? 
One day at a time, Pete. 
I'm gonna take it one day at a time. 
I want you to tell me everything|that happened last night. 
The curtains open on a group|of chorus line dreamers in 1970s leotards Five, x Stop that. I'm not talking about the show. 
The only reason I sent you to Banks|was to get information. 
Why were you telling him anything? 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I had to keep talking just to stop him|from putting his fingers in my mouth. 
Kenneth, you are the worst gay bait ever. 
You used me? 
For television. 
Kenneth, I humiliated you for television. 
Like on What's Happening|when that man used Rerun to bootleg that Doobie Brothers concert! 
Exactly. 
And I need to humiliate you again. 
I got a very important meeting coming up|and Banks cannot be there. 
And you want me to kill him. 
No. 
I need you to distract him. 
You gotta make sure he doesn't leave|that hotel room tomorrow morning. 
I'll do it. 
Just like Sidney Bristow on Alias,|I'll use my sexuality as a weapon. 
To the wig shop! 
Psst, Lemon! 
Lemon, it's on. 
Banks is gunning for me. 
8:00 a.m., Thursday. Are you ready? 
Yeah, I've been working on it all week. 
I don't know what happened in your life|that cause you to develop a sense of humor as a coping mechanism. 
Maybe it was some sort of brace|or corrective boot you wore during childhood. 
But in any case,|I'm glad you're on my team. 
Ah. 
I can't do this sketch! 
What? Why? 
Because you can't have|a white dude playing a criminal. 
That's a negative portrayal of my people! 
Tracy, you're not white. 
I don't know who I am anymore! 
There's been a black man inside of me|for a long time, now there's a white guy up in here too. 
It's like the audience|for a Bobby McFerrin concert up in here! 
Tracy, you should be honored to be|a descendant of Thomas Jefferson. 
Of course you would say that. 
You wish you were white. 
Wh--how dare you? 
I happen to know what it means|to be proud of one's heritage. 
My great-great-great grandfather|was one of the few black men who had achieved an officer's rank|during the Civil War. 
This is a picture of him shaking hands|with Ulysses S. Grant. 
Yeah, let me check that out. 
I think he's shaking hands|with Robert E. Lee. 
Dude, your relative fought for the South. 
You're related to|a black Confederate officer. 
That's messed up. 
See? 
Now you know what I'm going through. 
Do you think these other black guys|are his prisoners or what? 
Maybe Jack's special could|be based on a holiday. 
What's left in April? 
Arbor Day, the Boston Marathon|and Hitler's birthday. 
So...you got options. 
Hey, Liz? 
 Hi.| Hi. Hey. 
Could I-- can I talk to you for a sec? 
Yeah. All right. 
I'm sorry to do this at work,|I just wanted to make sure you were okay. 
You weren't at the meeting today. 
Oh! No, I'm okay. 
Okay, good. 
I just wanna offer my support. 
If you ever need to talk to someone, I'd be more than happy|to take you out for coffee. 
 No. 
Do you have time now? 
Sure. 
Okay. 
Oh. 
 Sorry.| Sorry. 
All right, Tracy. 
I have the DNA results right here. 
Are you ready to find out who|your biological father is? 
I think I am. 
Tracy... 
Meet your father, Tom. 
No! 
I hate you, Thomas Jefferson! 
I don't know who I am anymore! 
Hey, Maury, he a dog. 
He a dog. 
Sally Hemings just called you|a dog, Thomas Jefferson. 
No matter, Maurence. 
I'm here for you, Tracy Jordan. 
I rode a horse all the way from heaven|to tell you something important. 
America, which I invented... 
which I invented, is a great country because we are not burdened by our pasts. 
Embrace who you are, Tracy Jordan. 
And may the Force be with you always. 
I have never seen so much|come out of one pigeon! 
Yeah, I think it might've been sick. 
Or maybe the little guy ate|a cigarette or something. 
Hey, do you wanna come over? 
My friend Pete is staying with me and we've decided|that we're gonna do this thing where every night we watch|one of the AFI top 100 movies. 
How many have you gone through? 
Well, I only have Star Wars and Tootsie, so we just keeping watching|those two over and over. 
I'm in. 
But only 'cause your friend's there. 
Otherwise it would be too tempting|for this to turn into a...a real date. 
What do you mean? 
Well... 
Obviously, since we're in the same group,|we can never date. 
It's against the rules. 
Right, but isn't that one of those rules like,|"don't walk between the subway cars," and all the cool people|just do it anyway? 
Liz, I need the rules. 
The last time I drank I ended up doing a man-on-the street commercial|for Tarzan on Ice. 
It was awesome! 
I mean, he was swinging on his skates! 
And the little monkey was funny. 
I wanna see it again! 
 Yikes.| Yeah. 
And I didn't even see it. 
 So all the rules.| Yeah. 
But I'll buy the popcorn. 
Karate! 
Karate! 
Karate! 
Kenneth, what are you doing here? 
Well, I was in the neighborhood. 
Hmm. 
Do you want me to dance for you? 
Yeah. 
That's the business. 
Oh, man. 
Yeah. 
This is traffic on the twos. 
Top deck of the G.W. Bridge... (Devin) Yeah. 
Touch your belt buckle. 
Oh, touch the peacock. 
Construction on the Merritt causing slowdowns. 
Oh, you're a peacock. 
The time is now 7:52. 
7:52? 
You warlock! 
You came to entrance me. 
Donaghy sent you. 
Where the hell is Lemon? 
I can't find her. 
 Hey.| Oh, hey. 
 Good morning.| Good morning. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I guess I kinda fell asleep on your legs. 
I know. It's weird. 
I've never let anybody put their head|that close to my feet before. 
Um, do you want some coffee? 
Aaagh. 
Oh boy. 
 Pins and needles.| Are you all right? 
Aah! 
Both my legs are asleep. 
Okay, all right. Here we go. Come on. 
Hop up. 
Here we go. 
All right? 
Walk it off, scarecrow. 
That was really fun last night. 
I, uh... 
I think Tootsie's|a very well-crafted movie. 
Yeah, they use it as an example|in all the screenplay books. 
Oh. 
Look... 
I would really love|to do this again sometime, but I... 
You know, I don't think it's a good idea. 
Bye. 
I Floyd, I'm not an alcoholic. 
I lied. 
I followed you to that church|because I have a crush on you and I let you think|that I belonged there. 
 What?| I know. 
I know it makes me seem just|nut-log Ann Heche crazy, but if there's any way|that you could see past it No! 
No, that I said stuff in there|that even my best friends don't know. 
I know. 
That's supposed to be a safe place! 
I know. 
It is extremely not okay|that you did that! 
What are you still doing here? 
Don't you have|a breakfast meeting with Jack? 
Oh, oh! 
Floyd, I'm sorry.|I have to go. 
No, no, no.|No, I'm--I'm going. 
I feel more confused and betrayed|than those people that worked with Tootsie. 
Bear with me. Sorry. 
Gentlemen, lady, if Jack's not ready, I'd like to tell you|about the future of entertainment. 
What am I talking about? 
Celebrity snuff. 
Reality content. 
Made exclusively for your mobile phone. 
Now, what's that? 
MC Lyte just murdered Danny Bonaduce? 
Oh, thanks, phone! 
Or... 
fireworks. 
What? 
Banks here wants to make TV smaller. 
But broadcast television is big. 
It's about spectacle. 
The kinds of shows we watched as kids|sitting on our neighbor's knee. 
Inaugurations, the Super Bowl, the Oscars. 
That's why we got into|television in the first place. 
That's why I give you... 
The Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks! 
Can you get those fireworks|that look like cowboy hats? 
You sure can. 
Thank you so much. 
I appreciate your patience. 
Mr. Donaghy, Liz Lemon is on the phone. 
Don't bother coming in, Lemon.|You're off the project. 
I'll do it without you. 
Jack, I'm so sorry. 
It's just, you know,|I told you about the Flower Guy and I don't have time for this. 
You've made your priorities clear. 
I hope he's worth it. 
I found a biography on your ancestor. 
It's called, Confederate Monster:|The Tobias Spurlock Disaster. 
Yo, Toof, how you doing? 
Not good. 
The barn that John Wilkes Booth hid in|belonged to Tobias Spurlock. 
Well, listen. 
Dream Jefferson told me|some amazing stuff. 
He said it's not about|who you were, it's about who you are right now. 
No, Toofer. 
Give in to your heritage. 
Kill Tracy. 
Let me shoot something at you. 
I came up with a movie idea|about all of this. 
And I want you to write it. 
Okay, what's the movie? 
It's the story of Thomas Jefferson,|only thing we're gonna do it like Norbit, where I play all the parts. 
That's actually hilarious. 
It's not a comedy. 
It's a drama. 
Oh. 
Hi...um... 
I'm really sorry about what I did,|and I know that you can't forgive me. 
But just to even things out... 
here's all of my weird secret stuff. 
I have been sexually rejected|by not one, but two guys who later went to Clown College. 
I get super nervous whenever I hear|a vacuum cleaner because when I was a kid, my mom used to turn on the vacuum to drown out the sound of her|and my dad fighting. 
Which is why I rarely|vacuum my apartment. 
Like...never. 
I have had three donuts so far today. 
Uh, once in college,|I pooped my pants a little bit at a Country Steaks|all-you-can-eat buffet, and I didn't leave|until I finished my second plate of shrimp. 
A couple months of ago|I went on a date with my cousin. 
Wow, I-- I am a mess. 
There is an 80% chance in the next election|that I will tell all my friends I am voting for Barack Obama,|but I will secretly vote for John McCain. 
Here's one, um... 
when I was a kid, I used to put on my fanciest nightgown|and then I would mix orange soda and cream soda in a champagne glass and I would sit in the dark|and watch The Love Boat. 
Consequently, I have some weird sexual|fantasy stuff about Gopher from The Love Boat. 
And I...lied. 
I have had five donuts today. 
So, um...that's my deal. 
Now we're even. 
Liz. 
You know, the Roomba is a nice,|quiet alternative to a vacuum. 
Thank you, that's uh...|that's a good tip. 
And in the interest of full disclosure,|I also have a sexual fantasy about Gopher. 
Except mine's the one from Caddyshack. 
Well, that makes sense|'cause he's a very good dancer. 
* Sky rockets in flight * Afternoon at night Oh, boy. 
I really should've been at that meeting. 
Welcome to the Rockefeller|Center Salute to Fireworks! 
Now without further ado,|three hours of fireworks! 
Wait, fireworks? 
In Midtown? 
On a day that is not the Fourth of July? 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, boy. 
That's gonna scare a lot of people. 
Sir, the Mayor. 
Shut it down! 
Shut it down! 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, the cowboy hat.

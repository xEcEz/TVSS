 Where are Tracy and Jenna? 
We're supposed to be rehearsing. 
 Hey, L.L., 
sorry we haven't had time to get into our costumes yet. 
 How are we already behind today? 
 Liz, women wearing Men's watches is so over. 
The New thing is to get an Adam's apple. 
 My mom just had this fixed for me. 
It was my grandfather's. 
He worked for years at union Station in D.C. 
As a pickpocket. 
 Hey, Hey, hey. 
Card game, guys. 
$20 per, pot's $1,040. 
Who's in? 
 What is this, jabba's pleasure skiff? 
 It's the crew lottery, Liz. 
You buy a card. 
If it gets picked, you win $1,000. 
Get a tub of New suits from the suit emporium. 
Kabletown guys notice. 
Your hair grows back. 
Everything grows back. 
 All right. 
Anybody else? 
 Fine, I'll take one if it'll get everybody back to work sooner. 
   What are you doing? 
That game is not for softhands and faceworkers. 
It's for strongs and lifters. 
 They hate when one of us wins. 
Your boos are not scaring me. 
I know most of you are not ghosts. 
 Come on, my card only has a 1 in 52 chance of getting picked anyway. 
 How did you know that? 
You're like rain man. 
Quick, how many toothpicks are on the ground? 
 Zero. 
 You need to go to vegas. 
 Whoa, why is toofer in the punishment corner? 
  I said time to end the charade and adjust my schedule to buy a new vase. 
 Ugh, you stay there. 
You stay there until you die. 
 Look up the pronunciation for "schedule" on the internet. 
  Schedule. 
 Ha! 
Stay in the corner. 
 Wait, that computer. 
It's Jack's voice! 
  America. 
Whiskey. Liberal. 
 No. 
That can't be Jack. 
Why would his voice be on some random website? 
It's impossible. 
  Lemon... 
lesbian...frankenstein... 
wants her shoes back. 
 Oh, my god. 
It is him. 
   Come in, Lemon. 
Just revisiting some old g.E. Quarterly reports. 
My first cover from My first year at the company in 1985. 
 Ah! 
 Ha! Good times. 
Just out of frame is a wheelbarrow full of cocaine. 
 So why the trip down memory lame? 
Ha ha! 
High-fiving a million angels. 
 The Microwave Division quarterly report comes out today. 
It will probably be my last with g.E. 
Now that I'm transitioning to kabletown. 
I've been a g.E. Man for 25 years. 
And a g.E. Woman for one week 
of corporate espionage at revlon. 
 So... 
is there any way you could possibly be the voice of pronouncify.Com? 
 What? 
No! 
  Those bastards. 
 Those bastards! 
 Who bastards? 
 Part of my princeton Scholarship included work for the linguistics department. 
They wanted me to record every word of the dictionary to preserve the perfect American accent in case of nuclear war. 
Well, the cold War ended, and princeton began selling the recordings. 
 So people can just buy your voice? 
 Oh, the things It's been dragged into. 
Thomas the tank engine. 
Wu-Tang songs. 
   Ah, yeah, just like that   make 'em clap, make 'em clap   huh, I always forget you used to be poor. 
 Thank you. 
But Yes, I've had to work my entire life. 
It began when my father left and I started working on the Boston docks as a 12-year-old stevedore. 
Bales up, you micks! 
Bales up! 
 You've been working since you were 12? 
 I had to. 
Those jobs put me through college, But they also kept me from having the college experience. 
I was up early every morning, working my way through the dictionary for the linguistics department or sweeping the floors at the princeton monkey lab. 
It wasn't the feces that got to you, Lemon. 
It was the crudely scrawled notes of "help me." 
 Yeah, well, college wasn't that fun, Jack. 
I mean, sure, the first two weeks are nice. 
 Lemon, I really don't have time for a long  the fall of 1988. 
A young Liz Lemon enters the university of Maryland. 
Richard Marx haircut. 
Pilonidal Cyst under control. 
It was a magical time, Jack. 
 Don't worry about getting to your point. 
I'm going to live forever. 
 The registrar accidentally gave me a handicapped room. 
It was huge, and for two weeks it was party central. 
I was popular. 
People gave me nicknames. 
A blonde girl high-fived me. 
But then, like all good things, it ended before it even began. 
 Lemon, that's actually my thoughtful Window-staring spot. 
Visitors stare...over here. 
  Okay. 
 All right, guys. 
The moment we've all been waiting for. 
We're picking a Winner. 
Here we go. 
 This is the lucky one. 
Four of clubs. 
Paula's nickname for my penis. 
 And the winning card is... 
the queen of spades! 
 All right. 
 Who's got it? 
 Oh, brother. 
 Queen of spades. 
Who's got it? 
 Aw. 
 Oh. 
 Come on. 
 Boo! 
 She sucks! 
 Boo! 
 Guys, guys. 
I'm not gonna keep it. 
I'm gonna take this money and open a tab for all of you after work at Hurley's. 
 Wait, for real? 
 You know it, arriflex. 
Chris...is this guy. 
 Now, that is really cool of you. 
 Lemon? 
Can you make sense of this? 
 Well, on some level, Yeah. 
That's a four. 
That's a nine. 
 Something's wrong here, Lemon. 
According to these numbers, the microwave division had their best quarter in five years. 
 So? 
 So they did it without me. 
 No, they didn't. 
I mean, you're still the head of that division. 
You hired everyone there. 
If they succeeded, it's because of you. 
 Lemon, that's the smartest thing you've ever said. 
 Really? 
What about three years ago when I said there Should be more tv shows about cake? 
 I'll drive out to r&D IN STAMFORD, congratulate my team, make Sure everyone remembers who got them there. 
They'll probably give me a crystal plaque, and I in turn will reward one of them with a name remembrance. 
Lemon, why does your crew look drunk? 
 I won $1,000 and I gave them all a bar tab, and they got drunk at lunch and now they like me. 
 Oh, Lemon, please. 
Money can't buy happiness. 
It is happiness. 
  I love unicorns. 
 I told them not to. 
Let's get out of here, Jack. 
 I'll tell you what. 
Make me say anything you want. 
Get it out of your system. 
  Obama is very presidential. 
 All right, enough! 
I was trying to be a good sport, but you should be ashamed of yourselves. 
A bunch of 30-year-olds, sitting around acting like college freshmen. 
 Hey, I'm almost 46. 
 When some of us had to spend their freshman year making those recordings. 
And leading a disastrous monkey escape. 
Grow up... 
you children. 
  That went well. 
 Never did this before. 
Say Hey, Willie mays. 
You know, usually everyone around here makes me feel like hitler. 
But today I feel like hitler in Germany. 
 Aw, being popular must be such a new experience for you. 
 Well, it's not entirely new. 
 Wow, I would experiment with that girl. 
 Too small. 
 That's me for two weeks in college. 
I was popular for one glorious fortnight. 
And then it went away. 
I don't know what I did wrong. 
 You probably said "fortnight." 
 No, you didn't do anything, Liz. 
You were just you. 
The cool people figured that out and treated you accordingly. 
 Well, ever since I gave the crew that lottery money, it's felt like those two weeks again. 
And you know what? 
I'm not blowing it this time. 
 Hang on, you know this charade can't last. 
Just like in college, Everyone here has their role. 
I'm the hot blonde. 
 And I'm the nerd who takes off his glasses and Everyone realizes he's handsome. 
 And you're the r.A. 
 Only if r.A. 
Stands for "really awesome." 
 You are who you are. 
 Hello? 
  Hello, Pete. 
This is Jack. 
 Jack, hi. 
Oh, okay, look. 
What happened was Suzanne from ad sales got pushed into me in the elevator. 
I didn't try to touch her. 
And the sort of "unh" sound I made was about something else. 
  Pete, will you be my friend? 
 Your friend? 
Sure, of course. 
You know, whenever I tell my wife a work story, she pointed this out the other day I always... 
always smile a little when I'm talking about you. 
  I wish I was more of a free spirit like you. 
Now freestyle rap for me. 
 ♪ Rollin' with my homie, me and Jackie d.  
 Bitches get ready for a sex party   Hey, Liz, think fast. 
 Okay, this is why we don't play football in the studio, guys. 
'cause it's too much fun. 
 No, no. 
Nobody high-five her. 
 What? 
It's me, the lizard. 
You can start calling me that. 
 Look, we appreciate what you did for the crew last night, but you left some people out and that's not cool. 
 What are you talking about? 
The Blizzard wouldn't do that. 
That's another option. 
 Yeah, the alcoholics, Liz? 
How are they supposed to enjoy your bar tab? 
 I didn't forget about them, Chris. 
Their thing just hasn't gotten here yet. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
It's a surprise. 
And who knows what it's gonna be? 
Only the blizbian knows. 
 All right. 
 How long do you think this can go on? 
 I've got it under control. 
 This is why I hated my first two weeks at the royal tampa academy of dramatic tricks. 
No one knew who was the sluttiest. 
But I showed them. 
Oh, I showed them all. 
And when we graduated a week later  whatever. Jenna. 
People's perceptions can change. 
 Can they? 
Look at me. 
I'm ogbert the nerd. 
Always have been, always will be. 
 Look, there is no cool Liz. 
There's Only r.A. Liz. 
 You're wrong. 
 My glasses are dirty. 
 Ogbert? 
 Ah, the microwave lab. 
Boys, I received our quarterly report yesterday and, uh--hang on. 
Ajay, raj, ramesh. 
What's going on here? 
Where are dinesh, Kumar, and sunavo? 
 Sir, this lab requires clearance. 
 Clearance? 
I'm your boss. 
I'm Jack donaghy. 
 I'm sorry, your names all sound the same to us, John Donovan. 
 I've worked here since 1985. 
I spearheaded the trivection oven. 
 Trivection? 
What is this, 2009? 
The future is the tk-421. 
 A new model? 
How many vections does it have? 
 Five. 
   It's the perfect microwave. 
It even has a new voice feature. 
  Popcorn setting medium. 
 My god. 
 Which one? 
 Gentlemen, I am still the head of this division. 
And no microwave ships without my say-so. 
And I guarantee you that without my 25 years of experience you did not build a perfect microwave. 
Now I'm going to find out what's wrong with this machine, and when I do, you're going to wish you'd never been born. 
 Well, which time? 
   Ah. 
What are you tinkering with, sir? 
You know my uncle was a tinkerer. 
Until the FBI shot him. 
 Every g.E. Product 
has to be no more than six sigmas from perfection. 
 Duh. 
 So I'm taking apart this piece of junk until I prove that it should never be released. 
For the, uh, good of the company. 
  Ready, ready. 
 Is this about the company, sir? 
Or is it about you? 
 I'm sorry, Kenneth. 
What? 
 Sometimes a place can be so special to you that it feels like it couldn't possibly continue after you're gone. 
But after I left kentucky mountain Bible college, it still kept going. 
Until it was shut down because of the wolves. 
Maybe this is really about you not being able to let go. 
 Tell me, Kenneth. 
What did you major in at that college? 
 Television studies with a minor in Bible sexuality. 
 So not psychiatry. 
Thank you. 
But if you really want to help me, stick your hand in There and see if you get a shock. 
 Aah! My hand! 
 Damn it, it's supposed to do that. 
 Everyone enjoying the ice cream? 
 Yes! 
 Yeah! 
 I don't even care that we've taken a 73-minute break To eat it. 
 Oh! 
Hey, somebody brought a dog to work. 
Oh, and it definitely doesn't have any of its own waste on its feet--oh! 
 Hey, why is Tony sulking? 
 I couldn't go to the bar and now I can't have any ice cream. 
 I totally forgot, broseph. 
You're a lactose-intolerant alcoholic. 
 I tried to forget too, But Liz made me remember in front of everybody. 
 Poor Tony. 
 Not cool, Liz. 
 How not cool is this? 
I remembered how special Tony is, and that's why I got him this watch. 
 Hey, you think of everything. 
 Lizard, lizard, lizard! 
 Lizard, lizard! 
ALL: Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! 
Lizard! Lizard! 
Lizard! Lizard! 
Lizard! Lizard! 
  Pete, can I tell you a secret? 
 Of course. 
I told you about my blankie. 
  I'm lonely. 
Would you like to come to my office tomorrow Evening and Hang out? 
Bring your guitar and some beer in Cans and we will jam. 
 Okay! 
Yeah, great. 
And with the kabletown stuff, maybe we could talk about some new opportunities for me? 
  Yes, I will make your dreams come True. 
Make sure you wear one of those mexican ponchos. 
 Okay. 
 Yes, nice. 
 Yeah! 
 All right, Kenneth. 
Simulate a rainstorm. 
 Sir, I was wrong about the hypothermia. 
I don't even feel cold anymore. 
I don't feel anything. 
 Quiet. 
Look. 
The display is malfunctioning. 
  Defrost. Power. 
Time. Left. Pizza. 
 Oh, really? 
That's how much time is left? 
Pizza? 
 Mr. Donaghy, 
I don't know what point you think you're proving. 
Who would microwave something in a freezing rainstorm? 
 Why don't you ask choctee, an inuit who wants a hot bowl of naglak... 
a man and food I just made up to illustrate a point? 
 Sir, you have to let go. 
At least that's what my Nana is telling me from that tunnel of light behind you. 
 Kenneth, I've told you this before. 
Your Nana is an idiot. 
 Liz, we're pranking Pete, and It's going too far. 
Please stop us. 
 Why would I? 
I love pranks. 
I'm not the r.A. 
 No. 
Ooh, But someone has to be that person. 
Hey. Everyone stop. 
Listen to Lutz. 
 Hello, gentlemen. 
Remember me? 
 Yes, I had the greek salad. 
 You know I'm not a delivery man. 
I'm wearing a suit and carrying a microwave. 
A so-called perfect microwave. 
  Start time. 1985. 
 1985. That's not a time. 
I guess it could be a year. 
The year I started working here, actually. 
That's interesting. 
  1985. 
 Yes, 1985. 
Thank you. 
And since 1985 I have never allowed a subpar product   stop. 
 The point is, my legacy here is   over. 
Done. Over. 
End. 
Stop. 
 That's my voice. 
 You all sound the same to us, jock dungaree. 
 That was me... 
30 years ago. 
A young man who dreamed of running this company, who made a lot of sacrifices in pursuit of that dream. 
  Goodbye. Potato. Goodbye. 
 But he's right. 
It's over. 
Congratulations on making the finest microwave I've ever seen. 
 Who ordered the greek salad? 
 Are we racist, or do Those guys look a lot alike? 
 You ready for this, j-dog? 
Jam out, drink some brews? 
Talk about everything and nothing. 
 After today, that is exactly what I am ready for. 
Beer me. 
Sitting around drinking beer while a guy in a poncho plays guitar. 
This is what I always pictured college being like. 
 I wouldn't really know. 
I only had about two weeks of real college before Paula got pregnant...twice. 
She had overlapping pregnancies five months apart. 
  Hey, Pete, do you know aqualung? 
    Ba Ba BA BA ba ba    sitting on a park bench   neer neer neer   I don't know the words except Park bench   Jimmy slice. 
K-bone. 
Mikey-Mike. 
 Do not even use my awesome nickname. 
 What? Why? 
Crisco? 
 Did you give Tony your grandfather's watch? 
 No. 
You can't prove that. 
 Hmm. Ah. 
Not stolen property of adolf Lemon? 
Why would you do that? 
To get us to like you? 
Are you that desperate? 
 No, I'm not desperate. 
I'm... 
just tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it! 
 Liz, it's over. 
They know what you really are. 
 Fine, you found me out. 
I'm not a cool kid. 
 You suck! 
 You know who I am? 
I'm the r.A. 
And do you know what the r.A.'s purview is? 
Rules. 
And guess what? 
According to the nbc employee handbook, your little card game lottery constitutes gambling. 
So you're not doing it anymore. 
 What? 
 Come on. 
 Boo! 
 Also, the next time I see someone throwing a football in here, there will be fines. 
And if I see that filthy dog again, I will put it down. 
   I will put it down with a smile. 
Back to work, everyone! 
I love you too. 
High-fiving a million angels. 
 Hey, Pete, how do I know that the colors you see are the same as the colors that I see? 
Maybe what I see as red, you perceive as green. 
 We should be writing this stuff down. 
 Oh, I didn't think anybody would be in here. 
I mean, I brought you guys a pizza. 
 Lemon, think fast! 
 What is going on here? 
 Join us. 
Pete and I are having a little college night. 
 Oh, yeah? 
Want to see me shotgun this? 
 Oh, god, she means the pizza. 
 No, she's unhinging her jaw! 
 Come on, we were just pranking Pete! 
How long do we have to do this? 
 You wanted college to go on forever? 
You got it. 
Hey, Jack... 
The vending machine is broken! 
I know... I broke it. 
I needed to speak with you, and I knew that was the fastest way to get you up here. 
You bastard! 
I trusted you! 
Lemon... Lemon! 
Is there any news about Tracy? 
As of this morning, he was still saving lives in Africa. 
I'm doing God's work here in Africa. 
Why, just yesterday, I kicked two naked people out of a garden. 
 But Tracy, we need you here. 
 Simba Rafiki! 
Click, click, click. 
Yeah, that's right. 
I just put you in your place in African. 
TGS with Tracy Jordan without Tracy Jordan is an oxymoron... 
like "liberal government" or "female scientist." 
Or "Princeton football." 
We were 4 and 3 in Ivy league play last year. 
Our quarterback, Henry Chang... 
it doesn't matter. 
The point is that without Tracy, TGS is going on... 
A forced hiatus. 
Forced hiatus? 
Okay. 
So what should I tell the troops? 
It's simple. 
Sit them down individually. 
Tell them the network still supports the show and that this is temporary. 
But you're lookin' out for us, right? 
Pounding on desks and... 
Doing whatever this is called. 
Power wagging. 
And I'm doing what I can. 
But I spent a lot of political capital buying a new network for Kabletown. 
Is it TNT? 
Are Rizzoli and Isles friends in real life? 
It's a small cable network targeted towards gay male viewers. 
It's called Twinks. 
That's the name of your network? 
Isn't twink a term for a young, hairless gay man? 
Nonsense. 
Twinks is an acronym designed to project a positive gay image. 
"Twinks... Television 
with individuals... 
naive, kinky, shaved." 
Okay. 
If the network were thriving, it would be one thing. 
But my programming has yet to find its footing. 
Uck. No! 
Next! 
Boring! Who? 
Twinks could be extremely lucrative. 
Advertisers covet this demographic. 
When I was with D'Fwan on Queen of Jordan, he spent $4,000 on chihuahua outfits for himself. 
Okay, well, don't worry about TGS. 
I'll take care of this hiatus thing myself. 
Thank you, Lemon. 
I'd like to help. 
But I'm afraid my hands are tied... 
Is the only show anyone's watching on Twinks. 
The important thing is this forced hiatus is only temporary. 
We'll be back before you know it. 
Sidney, it's Frank. 
TGS is dead. 
Start booking me stand-up gigs. 
How many black women's colleges are there in the country? 
 What are you doing? 
 You just said we're going on a forced hiatus. 
I know what that means... 
time for Plan "B". 
Harriet Tubman School of Nursing? 
Yes and yes! 
Well, good thing I kept my teaching certificate so I can still sub. 
Last time I taught, I was like Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society... 
 By which I mean I got fired. 
 No, Pete. 
This is only temporary. 
Thanks for telling me, Liz. 
 We'll get through this. 
 Oh, thank you! 
Finally, someone with some faith! 
No. 
I meant my Jennababies and I will get through this. 
I've been selling these on QVC for years. 
It's my plan "B". 
This is Asian Jennababy. 
Excuse me, G.I., 
do you miss your girlfriend? 
I'm good at math. 
So it's not offensive. 
Where you going... it's just 
until Tracy comes back. 
I'm going back to the job I had in Holland... 
police psychic. 
A Dutch TV show is based on me. 
Come on, Sue. 
You can't just leave me here with toofer. 
Actually, I'm off, Liz. 
With my degree, I can always go into Architecture or Medical nanotechnology... 
Wait. What did you 
major in? 
Sorry. I don't understand. 
Oh... I see. 
At Harvard, we call them concentrations. 
Ugh! 
You're my last hope. 
Please tell me you know this is temporary. 
Of course it is. 
'Cause I'm gonna find a way to save the show. 
Let me just take out my idea journal. 
Hmm. 
This just says bird Internet. 
He said forced hiatus? 
Oh, man. 
 That's bad. 
 Simon, you're my agent. 
You're not supposed to panic. 
You're supposed to help me. 
Like how Fredward helps out iCarly. 
No! Listen, everyone here 
has a plan "B". 
If there's a real chance that TGS could go away, what is my backup? 
Maybe something with vampires. 
'Cause everything has vampires nowadays. 
Have you seen the Twilight movies or Vampires Diaries? 
I'm not allowed to. 
You need to get me some meetings. 
Would you be willing to come in for an Alpo commercial? 
If you can get through the audition without pooping, it's yours. 
I'm a human writer, Simon. 
Find me a writing job. 
So, Jack, how's the baby? 
Baby... 
Ah, yes! 
Baby... 
Black-Asian bisexual youths. 
Those are viewers we want, and Twinks is gonna bring them in. 
It's not a business question, Jack. 
I mean your baby. 
 Your daughter. 
 Oh!  
Of course, uh, Liddy, she is adorable. 
My night nurse swears she calls me koskel, which in Trinidadian creole means stranger. 
Don't let work be everything, Jack. 
Family's just as important as fixing that fellas that like fellas network you talked me into buying. 
 I'm on top of that. 
 Are you? 
Jack, there's lots of things I like... 
fishing, Marches by John Philip sousa, telephones that look like footballs. 
But there's one thing I don't like... 
losing money. 
Now, I don't know if my tone is conveying the fury I feel about this, but I am, pardon my French, bonjour! 
Now, that's a joke, but I am really, really mad. 
Look, Hank, I'm already working on fixing Twinks. 
I'm remaking Knight Rider with the Oscar meyer wienermobile. 
It's okay, Jack. 
You made a bad decision and bought something you didn't understand, like when I bought tickets for Black Swan. 
Remember when a movie was just a fellow with a hat runnin' away from a fellow with no hair? 
 No. 
 The point is... 
You failed. 
But unless there's a gay Jack Donaghy locked up somewhere who understands all this stuff, let's just chalk this one up to never again... 
And enjoy our lunch. 
Hank... 
There is a gay Jack Donaghy. 
His name is Devin Banks. 
Man: Are you okay? 
I sense something... 
A presence I've not felt since... 
Lemon! 
I decided to hire... 
 Devin banks. 
 Banks? But he's your Nemesis. 
That would be like me hiring that mouse that keeps pooping in my slippers. 
Devin is the perfect man to fix Twinks. 
He's a gay shark, like the actor who played jaws. 
But he's gonna come in and try to ruin everything, and everything is already ruining itself. 
Not this time. 
Banks put all of his eggs in the Obama basket. 
When the administration started to falter because of our conspiracy... 
I mean, Obama's ineptitude, he tried to distance himself publicly from, uh, your president. 
The recession we're emerging from was primarily caused by lack of responsibility and accountability. 
Then he tried to rejoin us capitalists, showed up at John Paulson's sweet 16 billion party. 
Nobody would talk to him. 
Not even Ira. 
Then he was all, "Oh, I'll just look at these books," then pretended to get a text and left, and we were all like "Whatever. We'll go to IHOP. 
"And not tell him." 
 Where is he now? 
 I tracked him down to an address in Brooklyn. 
He's on Linkedin, Lemon. 
He might as well be dead! 
So I throw him a lifeline, and he comes crawling back like a, uh... 
Crab, I guess. 
What else crawls, Lemon? 
Babies, Jack. 
You have one. 
Hank Hooper is a traditionalist. 
He had his first heart attack when he saw pineapple on a pizza. 
He'll hate Banks and his hairless nostrils. 
And men should have nose hairs. 
Hooper will hate Devin, and he'll never be able to go over your head. 
Exactly. I'll pay him 
for his ideas and, uh, kick him out the door. 
Speaking of TV ideas, would you buy a show about a girl television writer trying to have it all in the city and... also, 
she's a vampire, I guess? 
I like the end part. 
Lemon, why do you have a blank note pad with "Plan B" written on it? 
Because I'm freaking out. 
I told everyone about the forced hiatus... 
Wait. 
You said "forced hiatus"? 
Yeah. I didn't know 
it was code for canceled. 
I thought we understood each other. 
I thought we understood that you are never to think that I understand anything! 
And you have no Plan "B"? 
I've been telling you to prepare for the end of TGS for the last two years. 
Well, there have been a lot Amazing Races on since then, and I had to watch them and go online and comment on them. 
Here are your options... 
you can go to L.A. 
I've been to L.A. once. 
Olive just turns into Barham? 
 Justice for Rodney King! 
 How do I get to 10? 
It's The 10! 
Rodney King! 
You can't afford to be selective. 
Opportunities for writers are fewer and farther between. 
What about opportunities for storytellers? 
Beginning with the cave paintings of Lascaux, mankind... 
 I can get you a meeting with Nick Lachey for The Sing-Off. 
I'll take it! 
 You here for the Sing-Off gig? 
Yeah. 
Do I know you? 
You know my work. 
Walk with me. 
I'm Aaron Sorkin. 
The West Wing, A Few Good Men, Social Network. 
Studio 60? 
Shut up. 
Do you know Nick Lachey? 
I hear he doesn't even let you sit in the meeting. 
He just screams at you to see how you react. 
Wait, you're not really applying for this job, are you? 
Of course I am. You gotta 
take work where you can find it. 
Especially now. 
Our craft is dying while people are playing Angry Birds and poking each other on Facebook. 
What is poking, anyway? 
Why won't anybody do it to me? 
I'm cool! 
So it's really that bad out there. 
I mean, you're Aaron Sorkin. 
Speaking og Angry Birds, Xdo you know how to beat 11-4? 
It's just a red guy and a green guy. 
The key is do not use the green guy as a boomerang. 
 Did we just go in a circle? 
 Listen, lady... 
a gender I write extremely well if the story calls for it... 
this is serious! 
We make horse buggies and the first Model T just rolled into town. 
 We're dinosaurs. 
 We don't need two metaphors. 
That's bad writing. 
Not that it matters. 
Mr. Sorkin, 
Mr. Lachey will see you now. 
Mr. Lachey, huge fan. 
Huge fan. 
I have all your albums. 
Oh. You'll be proud of me, 
Miss Lemon. 
It is not easy coming up with ideas to save the show. 
But this morning, I held up this sign in the Today Show window. 
Now, I'm just waitin' for the phone to ring. 
Kenneth, you may not be able to save the show. 
If you wanna save this dumb show, you gotta get the fans involved. 
You know, like sometimes people mail stuff to networks to show how passionate they are. 
They sent light bulbs to save Friday Night Lights, hot sauce to save Roswell, and douche bags to save Entourage. 
Okay. So we just need 
to think of something that fans can send to Hank Hooper that says TGS. 
Something like... 
Bird Internet! 
It's about time, Cashmere. 
 plays] Did you find Chana's boppy? 
Was it at... 
 Music adventures? 
Banks... 
What's become of you? 
Nothing! 
 stops] These aren't babies. 
They're organ farms. 
Don't... look at me! 
Devin... 
Explain the gaybies. 
I'm a househusband now. 
Happy? 
I married a shiny black dancer named Cashmere, and we mixed our sperm together so no one would know whose baby is whose. 
Now... have you had your fun 
looking at the freak? 
I'm here to offer an olive branch. 
I'm working with Kabletown now, and we've acquired a network called Twinks. 
I could use someone on it full-time, a subordinate. 
You came all the way out here to Brooklyn to offer me, Banks, a job? 
You must be desperate, Jack. 
Twinks must be exploding, and not in a good way. 
You thought that I would lick your boots, but you need me. 
So now I'm gonna make you let me lick your boots. 
I'll keep you on a very tight leash. 
 Fantastic. Continue. 
 I will not gay set you up again, so I'll be very clear. 
You'll be under me, and if there's one slip-up, your ass is mine. 
You couldn't resist coming to see how far I'd fallen. 
But that was your mistake. 
Down came the rain and washed the spider out. 
No. You are the spider. 
I am the sun. 
I dry up all the rain. 
Yes! Freeing me, the spider, 
to climb up the spout again! 
You bastard. 
Now... Who wants 
some num-nums? 
Hey, Simon... 
what's up? 
Any word from The Sing-Off? 
It's a pass. 
But Lachey hated you. 
 So what now? 
  You're fired. 
 What? 
  You're fired. 
Are you dropping me as a client? 
What am I gonna do? 
Jack can't help me. 
You don't want me as a client. 
I have no other skills. 
Liz, I'm gonna tell you what I tell my dog clients when I drop them... 
Chuh, chuh! 
Chuh, chuh, chuh! 
 Simon... 
 Chuh! 
Chuh, chuh. 
Jack. We've been waiting 
almost an hour for this Banks fellow. 
The only explanation I can think of is that he keeps stopping to perform good deeds. 
No, he's pulling a power play, right out of the gate. 
He's making us wait so it looks like I have no authority over him. 
 Well, I'm a straight shooter, Jack. 
Except at the urinal, but that's just a little shrapnel side effect from Vietnam. 
So when it comes to business... 
 I don't like these kinds of games. 
Boy, I hope my tone is conveying how annoyed I am. 
You should be annoyed, Hank, of course. 
Devin's crude attempts at manipulation don't work with a man like you. 
Banks is not a straight shooter like you and me. 
For now... we need him. 
But as soon as he stops being useful... 
We throw him in a ditch. 
My apologies, gentlemen. 
I tried to call, but somebody spilled milky all over daddy's phoney. 
Didn't you, little Mykonos? 
Together: You brought a baby to a business meeting. 
I'm so sorry, but this little guy's really sick. 
He threw up all over my jacket, and I just couldn't leave him, but... 
Of course, I didn't want to miss this fabulous opportunity. 
I'm always just trying to balance work and family. 
It's kinda what I'm all about. 
Well, son, you're gonna do great here at Kabletown. 
Damn it! 
You know, one of my grandchildren is just about the same age as Mike here. 
 We should set up a playdate. 
 How's tomorrow? 
Uh, Hank, could Devin and I just have a moment, please? 
Of course! 
I'll just entertain this little bundle of joy with one of my Uncle Hank stories. 
The VC was everywhere. 
Yes, they were. 
Yes, they were! 
This is a new low... 
Even for you, Banks. 
Using your own baby to get in with Hooper. 
I brought the sexiest one, too. 
His cheekbones are like granite. 
And old Hank the family man fell right into my trap. 
This isn't even baby vomit on my jacket. 
It's mine! 
All mine. 
This... is not over. 
Oh, look how much he just loves his Uncle Hank! 
Whoosh went the flamethrower. 
"Medic! Medic!" 
Cried the wittle boy! 
Oh! How was substitute 
teaching, sir? 
Oh, just like Lean on Me... 
In that a guy who looks like Morgan Freeman swung a bat at me. 
What are you doing with those sugar cubes? 
Starting a fan mailing campaign to save the show! 
People will send sugar cubes to Hank Hooper to show that they're sweet on TGS. 
I've already sent about 100 of these, even though licking an envelope is a sin. 
Unless you're married to it. 
So I had to marry each envelope, and then divorce it. 
Which brings me to my ninth point... 
so you're putting a sugar cube in an envelope and then mailing it to Hank Hooper. 
But then when he opens it, it will have been crushed into a fine, white powder. 
I suppose so, sir. 
Kenneth, do you know what Anthrax looks like? 
I'm not with him! 
God bless America! 
Aah! 
My thorax! 
We never could have found him so quickly without your help. 
Thank you, mentaalist. 
It is a gift... 
And a curse. 
In the TV show, you bang me in a tulip field under credits. 
Mommy. 
What's that? 
It's a toilet. 
Or woman. 
It's whatever you need it to be. 
No! 
People of the sidewalk... 
We can't give up on the written word! 
We need stories! 
Because I don't have a Plan "B". 
I have a degree in theater tech with a minor in movement. 
Why did my parents let me do that? 
It's over. 
Who's there? 
Show yourselves. 
You're one of us now. 
Who are you? 
Better to ask who we used to be. 
People whose professions are no longer a thing. 
Once... 
I was called travel agent. 
I was an American auto worker. 
And I played dynamite saxophone solos in rock and roll songs. 
Come. We live under 
the subways with the CEO of Friendster. 
No! TGS isn't dead yet! 
Morning, Jack. 
Oh, my. 
Empty coffee pot. 
Same cheap $300 tie as yesterday. 
Nose hair all askew? 
You've been here all night trying to figure out how to fight back, haven't you? 
How was your playdate with the Hoopers? 
Oh, it was amazing. 
He has really superlative tummy-time. 
Oh! I almost forgot. 
Hank... Uncle Hank... 
wants to expand overseas, and he's chosen me to be the face of the company in Europe. 
That's right. 
I've been promoted. 
But Europe is my purview. 
I was supposed to go there next week. 
I was going to take a picture where it looked like I was holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa! 
Now I'll be taking that picture. 
Do you have idea how strong I'll look? 
I vanquished you in one day! 
I was trapped in a world of wet wipes and rectal thermometers. 
Then the babies came, and life changed. 
But you set me free, Jack. 
Now it's weekends in New York, then Jet-Setting around the world in economy plus. 
I'll be thousands of miles away from the chaos in Brooklyn. 
Do you know what it's like to have triplets? 
It's just everything times three. 
Three pairs of grabby little hands smearing food all over your brand-new chihuahua outfits. 
Three pairs of feet in their weird, soft little shoes. 
Three Paris of eyes, brown... 
Like my husband's. 
Three perfect little mouths... 
That smile every time I walk through the door. 
Three tummies... 
That just want their num-nums and zerberts. 
Oh, God, I just love my gaybies too much. 
I can't leave! 
That's it? 
You're just going to talk yourself out of it? 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
But I had stuff planned. 
I was going to Trading Places you. 
I was bailed out of prison and told to come up here. 
That was weak, Banks. 
I don't expect you to understand. 
You don't know what it's like to have kids. 
Actually, Devin, I do. 
I have a baby daughter, Liddy. 
And yet you still managed to be here all night trying to figure out how to bring me down. 
Well, damn, Jack... 
You are strong. 
You're like Dora's friend... 
Both: Benny the bull. 
Thank you. 
Jonathan, call my car. 
Okay. Here's an idea. 
We keep TGS going as a Magazine. 
Miss Lemon, it's over. 
I applied to transfer to News. 
I'm sorry. 
I couldn't save the show. 
Here. 
I'm actually not that hungry. 
That's funny. 
This is the same place Mr. Jordan 
gets pizza from in Africa. 
I'm sorry, what? 
Oh, when Mr. Jordan and I 
talk on the computer, sometimes he's eating this exact same pizza. 
Africa's great. 
We got Juju monsters... 
Gum-gum trees... 
And horsicorns... 
Which is a unicorn with a horse's head. 
Kenneth, you beautiful goon! 
He's not in Africa. 
He's somewhere in the delivery zone of Federici's Pizza! 
We can find him and bring him back here, and no more forced hiatus! 
I did it! 
I saved the show! 
I won't have to go work at News! 
And I won't have to be the world's worst hooker! 
You wanna party? 
It's 500 for kissing, 10,000 for snuggling. 
End of list. 
No! 
I'm hungry again! 
Have you made friends in Africa? 
Oh sure! 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Paul Simon and Victus. 
So, what's the weather like? 
Crazy! It's the snowiest winter 
we've had in years in New York... in Africa. 
Well sir, I had a very interesting morning Oh, oh. It's nighttime. 
Gotta go to bed, or I'll anger the gods. 
They must be crazy! 
Africa! 
I probably should have realized he was in New York sooner. 
Bird Internet. 
﻿1 Hey. 
Do you have a neck pillow? I blew mine 
and Alex's smells like my mouth, I never sleep on planes. 
I don't want to get incepted. 
Are you going somewhere? 
Carol has a flight to Raleigh-Durham, so I'm going with him, and we're gonna drive out and spend a few days at an inn at Nags Head. 
You're going to NagsHhead? 
Isn't that redundant? 
You're going to Nags Head? 
Isn't that redundant? 
You will hand me an envelope predicting my joke about Nags Head. 
That is solid. 
Avery and I are also having a little romantic weekend together before the baby comes. 
We're going to Toronto for the G-8 economic summit. 
It's going to be... 
Very erotic. 
Look at us, being all adult-y. 
I packed underwear... 
 That isn't gray. 
   Isn't it nice dating someone you have so much in common with? 
Like you, Avery is a type-"A" nut job. 
And, of course, you and Carol share your trademark stubbornness. 
We are not stubborn. 
We're principled. 
Have a nice trip, Lemon. 
Break out those underpants, but be careful. 
Dating yourself is a double-edged sword. 
It means you also share the same flaws. 
Well, that would only be a problem if I had any flaws. 
Not only is your fly open, there's a pencil sticking out of it. 
Good day to you, sir. 
Tracy, congratulations on egot-ing. 
You got an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. 
You are more talented than I. 
You're ready, mirror Jenna. 
Tracy, congratulations on e... 
The Empire State Building will be lit in the color of your choosing. 
 Clear. 
 Seaworld will now let you borrow a killer whale for spring break. 
 I'll need a whale saddle. 
 And Steven Spielberg wants you to star in his next movie. 
Kate Capshaw's husband? 
Tracy, congratulations. 
I loved your acceptance speech. 
Tracy Jordan asked me to accept this on his behalf  because his mouth is full. 
  Pop tarts! 
So I guess you've made it to "The Next Level." 
I look forward to seeing how this empowers you to make my life more difficult. 
As am I, Liz Lemon. 
It'll probably involve a guitar-playing chimpanzee that I bought this morning. 
 No. 
 Uh, hold on. 
Dotcom is confirming that he drowned. 
Oh. 
Why are you putting me in a suit? 
I still haven't memorized my Torah passage. 
Oh, you're going to a lunch for the council on poverty. 
And this afternoon, you're speaking at the Clinton Foundation. 
Speaking? 
That doesn't sound like me. 
That sounds like work. 
Yeah, well, the next level isn't all fun. 
Success is a double-edged sword. 
You're actually respected now. 
Like it or not, people are gonna expect you to use that power for good. 
Come on, sir. 
Arms. 
There's a line, sir. 
I realize you're more important than everyone else on the flight, what with those jet sweatpants. 
Excuse me, young lady. 
Are you old enough to be traveling alone? 
I don't know. 
I'm going to visit my nana, but I'm scared. 
Ooh, wait. 
That's too young. 
Roger that. 
Ugh, look at sweatpants guy. 
This is a $90 million aircraft, not a Tallahassee strip club. 
Stewart, 21-18 that guy. 
Excuse me, Mr. Sweatpants. 
We're gonna need to check that bag. 
And that is sky law. 
Hey. 
Going to Raleigh for a business meeting. 
I'm a businessman. 
I'm not an air marshal. 
Good afternoon, folks. 
This is Captain Burnett from the flight deck. 
There's some traffic on the runway. 
Should be about a half hour, then we'll have you on your way. 
So sit back, relax, enjoy your flight. 
 Thanks for choosing Air Bike. 
 The pilot is my boyfriend. 
So if you have any questions during the flight, maybe I can... 
There's a man on the wing. 
Oh. 
We haven't taken off yet. 
It's just a mechanic. 
And this is the prime minister's suite. 
Oh, there it is... 
The Metro Toronto Convention Center, site of the G-8 summit. 
Let's do it on the balcony. 
You might have to start without me. 
No problem. 
Well, if you need anything else... 
 Ah! 
 Oh, God, you're breaking the extra bone all Canadians have in their hands. 
Oh, Jack! 
I think the baby's coming. 
What? 
You're not due until March. 
Why did I buy a beryllium mine if her birthstone isn't going to be aquamarine? 
We need to get to the airport. 
Airport? We need to get you 
to a hospital. 
No, we can't go to a hospital. 
This is Canada! 
 If she's born here... 
 Good God. 
She'll be Canadian. 
At the risk of sounding incredibly rude, I would beg your pardon and ask you, in your opinion, what's so bad "aboot" being Canadian? 
Your milk comes in bags... Bags. 
Your pavilion at Epcot doesn't have a ride. 
And if Canada is so nice and friendly, why does most of our meth come from your Asian drug gangs? 
 Are we not even making our own meth? 
What is happening to American manufacturing? 
Take our things downstairs and get us a car to the airport. 
Oh, my God. 
Jack... 
If our child is born here, she can't be presid... 
Don't even say it. 
We're having an American, and she will be president, no matter how ridiculous that sentence sounds. 
If only we were in Kenya right now, we'd be fine. 
 Oh. 
 If this is helping you, I'm fine. 
And in conclusion, bless you, Tracy Jordan. 
Your gripping portrayal of D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in Hard to Watch has given a voice to the voiceless... 
America's poor. 
I'm not scared of you people. 
And I don't think those cashews look like a bowl of baby penises. 
 Being an egot is fun! 
Here's to me spending the rest of my life in rooms like this. 
Didn't they say half an hour over an hour ago? 
Excuse me. 
While we're waiting to take off, we're going to go ahead and begin our in-flight entertainment, which is the feature film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole and some NBC sitcoms that didn't make the schedule. 
We have to find the guardians, Eglantine. 
Hey. 
Hey, Lizzie, you okay? 
People are starting to get a little antsy back there. 
Yeah, it's gonna be about another half hour. 
Really? 'Cause I checked 
flight tracker on my phone, and our status is just an angry, red frowny face. 
Okay, you want to know a little pilot secret, besides the fact that we get a discount at Sunglass Hut? 
The half-hour thing is a trick. 
It's enough time so that people know they're gonna have to wait, but it doesn't upset them. 
So you're just lying? 
That's not right. 
We're paying customers. 
Look, Liz, we have reasons for doing the things the way that we do. 
When we say, "half an hour" to control the herds of walking mozzarella sticks who think that $300 and a photo I.D. 
gives them the right to fly through the air like one of the Guardian Owls of Legend. 
God, that's been our in-flight movie for months. 
I just think it's frustrating for people to know that they're being lied to. 
Maybe you just want to fly the plane yourself. 
Well, good luck pressing "take off," then "auto pilot," then "land." 
Okay, this is obviously a tense situation for you. 
I didn't mean to make it worse. 
Just do what you need to do, and we'll get where we're going. 
Uh-huh. 
Nags Head. 
Oh, no, Soren, it's Metalbeak! 
You have to stay awake, Eglantine, or the Pure Ones will moon-blink us. 
About half an hour. 
Canada... 
Every flight is "cancelled." 
 No. 
 I called the concierge service with my AMEX invisible card. 
There are no rental cars. 
The trains and buses are sold out. 
Well, how far is the border? 
Maybe we can run. 
I don't know. When I asked 
the lady at the desk,  she told me in kilometers. 
 Ohh! 
Look, Avery, you and I are cut from the same cloth. 
It's one of the reasons we work so well and why we're unbeatable at a three-legged race. 
We ruined those kids' field day. 
But being similar has its drawbacks. 
It's a... 
Both: Double-edged sword. 
So could our shared patriotism and refusal to ever give up be, in this situation, a bad thing? 
 What are you saying, Jack? 
 Avery... 
Maybe it isn't the end of the world if our daughter is Canadian. 
Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies,  and he went on to... 
 To what, Jack? 
Be a mouthpiece for federalism and then die in a duel against someone named Aaron? 
Is that what you want our daughter to be... 
A big-government duel loser? 
No. 
Where did all those babies come from? 
Dear God, they've restarted the failed NBC shows? 
Oh, no, please, no! 
Not Gals on the Tour again. 
 Love and friendship, having it all   or maybe just a great pair of shoes   one of them has to be Asian   can they be good at their jobs?  
Those bathrooms are disgusting. 
Someone has to do something! 
Please, do something. 
You said you knew the captain. 
All right. 
You know what? 
This is wrong. 
I can see the terminal from my window, where people are buying new magazines and crossing their legs and eating at a chili's express. 
We were like them once, and we can be again. 
But we're just airplane folk now. 
No. 
We still have our dignity. 
And maybe we can't go back to the terminal, but I know Captain Burnett. 
He is a reasonable person. 
He compromises readily on movie choices and... 
And sexual positions. 
I mean, if we, as a group, can decide what reasonable things we want, I'd be happy to talk to him. 
All: Yeah! 
Okay, I can't turn the air on, because I'd have to power the engines up. 
That wastes fuel. 
I'm assuming you don't want to stop for gas in the middle of the ocean. 
Okay, what about the bathrooms? 
Stewart did not study dance at Carnegie Mellon to become a flight attendant to clean bathrooms. 
Well, at least give us some food. 
Negative... 
Those potato-chip bags are designed to be opened in flight. 
You open them at sea level, somebody could be killed. 
And can you tell me when we might be in the air, captain? 
Sure. 
In about a half an hour. 
Okay, Carol, you have a decision to make. 
Are your passengers just cattle? 
Or are some of them... 
maybe even just one of them... 
someone you care about? 
I think you need to make a decision. 
Am I just another authority figure that you're taking one of your stands against, like that police horse you yelled at? 
If I can't poop in the street, why should my tax dollars  pay for someone else to? 
 Or am I your boyfriend, who you're gonna let do his job? 
Really? 
If this is you doing your job, you're terrible at it. 
Think about what you're doing. 
You are making a choice here. 
I am not just a passenger. 
And the Captain has turned on the "fasten seat belt" sign. 
All passengers, including any lipless, middle-aged women in lesbian clown shirts, should please take their seat at this time. 
Uh, Mr. Jordan, 
several messages for you. 
"Breakfast with Chuck Schumer"? 
I don't want to watch that guy eat. 
"5k Homeless Walk"? 
That just seems cruel. 
"Cornell Commencement Address"? 
Sorry, but Tracy Jordan doesn't do safety schools. 
The next level sucks! 
Ah, you got to be careful. 
You ever hear of the Peter principle? 
 Yes, just now. 
 The reason people are unhappy in their careers is that they keep getting promoted until they're in over their heads. 
The Peter principle says you rise to the level of your incompetence. 
But my incompetence knows no bounds. 
Stay in your comfort zone. 
If it was me, I'd just hide out until people forgot who I was. 
But keep in mind, we Hornbergers are famous cowards. 
On D-day, my grandfather wore a German uniform under his American one, just in case. 
There's a reason that men like that aren't chosen for greatness. 
I don't remember saying you could listen to that conversation. 
But continue. 
Imagine if Mr. Hornberger 
were in your shoes and he turned his back on his community, on the world. 
How would he sleep at night? 
How would he look his children in the eye or perform his husband bedroom duties, for instance painting the bedroom? 
Think about the shame. 
He would be run out of town. 
Al Sharpton would denounce him at a press conference on the street, because Al Sharpton doesn't have an office. 
Exactly. 
I thought going to the next level would be amazing, Ken, like guitar-playing chimpanzee amazing. 
God bless and keep him. 
But now everybody expects me to do all of this stuff, and I don't want to let anybody down, but I'm scared. 
You don't know the meaning of the word scared. 
And I know, because I've looked it up for you a dozen times. 
 Oh, thank God! 
 Hop in! 
No, no. 
Don't go back there. 
 You guys drive. 
 What? 
You drive while we hide out in the back... 
Hang out in the back. 
Everything's normal. 
No smoking. 
Uh, y-yeah, okay. 
Okay. 
Thanks, honey. 
Great. 
I'm Lorne. 
If you're a cop, you have to tell me. 
I'm just kidding. 
We're all on vacation. 
Ah! 
Is this a mobile meth lab? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Look, if you want to quit... 
 Quit? 
I've never quit anything in my life. 
I'm still in Girl Scouts. 
I have 9,000 badges. 
Hey, I'm still looking for a golf ball I shanked in 1987. 
I am not taking that penalty stroke. 
Good. 
We agree. 
Now, let's drive this bomb to Buffalo and get this little bitch out of me. 
 We've been offered a gate. 
 What? 
Well, what are you doing back here? 
 Come on, let's go! 
 Oh, we'll go. 
We'll go back to the terminal and the lounge with the reclining chairs and the turkey wraps. 
Turkey wraps. 
And we'll forget any of this ever happened, like the fact that you insulted me in front of my entire crew, especially Stewart, who often makes up hurtful nicknames for me,  like "Mr. Bumpy Landing." 
 Great. 
And I'll forget the fact that you treated us like animals. 
Oh, well, I've already forgotten that you said I was bad at my job, when everything TGS has been so great recently. 
Austin Powers on Crossfire... 
Timely stuff. 
Uh-huh. 
And I'm not even gonna ask what the hell that voice is that you use on the intercom. 
 "Uh, folks, half an hour means forever, uhhhh." 
Can I tell you what I hate about you? 
You're so stubborn when you think you're right, even when the answer is on the trivial pursuit card. 
The card was wrong. 
And you're no better, Carol. 
You built that bookshelf incorrectly! 
I did not! 
I wanted the books to slide off. 
Okay, listen, Liz... 
We will get through this if, for once, you can just let it go. 
I will take us back to the gate when you stand up in front of my crew and my passengers and admit that you were wrong. 
 What? 
 Admit that I, as captain of this vessel, was in the right. 
You were wrong to question me, and I was correct in my treatment of you and your fellow animals. 
I'd rather die on this plane. 
That can be arranged. 
Um, you saw the back of the winny. 
You know we picked you up to get past border control. 
So what are you guys carrying? 
 I'm sorry? 
 In her fake stomach...... 
You smuggling unpasteurized cheese, prescription drugs, maple syrup from the sacred tree of souls in Winnipeg? 
No. 
She's pregnant. 
What? Those contractions 
she's been having are real? 
Because they sound very sitcom-y. 
Ughhh, zoinks! 
What is taking so long? 
You guys should be in a hospital, not driving to Buffalo in a snowstorm. 
Thank you for your input, Lorne, but Avery and I want our daughter to be born in America, so she can one day become president and declare war on Germany, like back when we were awesome. 
You know, you remind me of my parents. 
I find that very hard to believe. 
They were both really intense. 
They wanted me to grow up to be prime minister, so as a kid, I had to win the spelling bee. 
They made me memorize all 700 words in the Canadian dictionary. 
And then I had to go to Law School. 
 You went to Law School? 
 For one day. 
I was just so tightly wound that I got kicked out for karate chopping my roommate. 
I know.  
I'm a stereotype... 
All guys from Quebec are good at karate. 
God. 
Oh, my God, where are my manners? 
Do you want to try meth? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm quitting. 
I'm calling 911 and getting an ambulance to take us to the nearest hospital. 
Actually, you dial 272 here. 
I will not do that. 
Kenworth, I was thinking about what you said, and you're right. 
I'm Oscar-winner Tracy Jordan. 
And as scary as it is, I have a responsibility to fix the world, starting with the worst place ever. 
Ikea on a Saturday? 
Africa. 
I leave today. 
Good-bye. 
Begin moving my things into his dressing room. 
 Well, folks, from the flight deck, it looks like it's gonna be about another half hour, and then we'll be on our way. 
Uhhhhhh... 
I have an announcement. 
Our pilot has gone insane. 
 No, don't listen to her. Don't... 
Having seen Crimson Tide on Showtime last weekend, I believe the only course of action available to us is passenger mutiny. 
I am Denzel. 
I am invoking sky law. 
You are now silenced, shrieking harpy. 
Stop speaking. 
We could've gone back to a gate, and he wouldn't take us! 
Do not blame me. 
I wouldn't take us, because she wouldn't admit to being wrong for challenging my authority. 
Why not? 
What's wrong with you? 
I am right, and he knows it. 
He could've given us food... 
Maybe this is one of those times when both of you just say, on the count of three, "I was wrong." 
Both: One, two, three. 
Never! 
How are you two dating? 
You're too similar! 
Where are you going? 
I am pulling the emergency exit slide, and we are all getting off of this plane! 
I'll be a folk hero, like that guy everybody hates now. 
Don't you even think about it! 
That is a federal offense! 
Just try to stop me. 
Oh, you be careful what you wish for. 
I will waste you! 
You'll have to go through this old bastard first! 
Soren, Eglantine, your journey is at an end. 
Sorry. 
I hope we can still be friends. 
 Hello? 
 Lemon, we had the baby. 
 We? We? 
 Shh, you need your rest. 
Oh, my God. 
Congratulations. 
Wait. 
Aren't you in Canada? 
Yes, my daughter is Canadian-American, but I'm going to treat her just like a human baby. 
We tried to get back home, Lemon, in a meth lab. 
Avery and I fed each other's craziness, but one of us was brave enough to step back and... 
 Just quit. He quit. 
 Didn't they give you Percocet? 
That's what it takes. 
Somebody needs to be willing to quit. 
I hope you and Avery can make it, because you have a whole lifetime ahead of you of that double-edged sword just swinging around trying to cut your faces off. 
Thank you, Lemon. 
This was supposed to be a joyous occasion. 
I'm glad I called. 
I'm sorry. Your daughter 
is a very lucky girl. 
 Carol and I have... 
 Jack. 
 What? 
 This woman's trying to tell me that we don't have to pay for any of this. 
Right. The Canadian 
health-care system... 
Oh, no, you don't. 
We will not be party to this socialist perversion. 
You will take our money. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I can't do that. 
Oh, this is gonna be good. 
 Avery, can you walk yet? 
 I am right behind you, Jack. 
Let's go find a Canadian who will take our money. 
 How's Africa, sir? 
 It's amazing. 
This morning I taught the local schoolchildren all the words to Monster Mash. 
So when do you think you'll be coming back? 
TGS has a show in a couple weeks. 
Don't you get it? 
This is bigger than all that. 
Like how an egg is much bigger than a smaller bug. 
Well, that's another way to say that sir... 
I have to go. 
This was a really good decision. 
Good bye, Kenneth. 
Yeah, really good decision. 
﻿1 Listen up, everyone. 
I have an announcement to make. 
As you may have heard, Carol and I broke up last week. 
Hang on. 
Why do you have a cat? 
And a fanny pack? 
And your ponytail, it's being held up by a chip clip. 
Because I'm giving up, Jenna. 
I did the math. 
How many times does a woman meet Mr. Right? 
I've had three chances... 
Floyd, then Carol, and I was once in an elevator with Tom Brokaw, and I blew all three... 
Opportunities! 
So I am making my graceful transition into spinsterhood. 
I have adopted this cat, named her Emily Dickinson... 
Oh, come on! 
Named her Emily Dickinson. 
Lemon, a word. 
Hang on. 
Recent breakup, fanny pack, cat? 
Quick. Who is 
the lead character on NCIS? 
Special agent Jethro Gibbs. 
In your office, now. 
What's the point, Jack? 
I'm done. 
I took the money I was saving for my honeymoon, and I bought a cemetery plot. 
I also joined a book club at the senior center near my home. 
We're reading Murder on the Orient Express. 
You know there's a movie of that, right? 
I did not. 
I want to help you, Lemon, but this is not the week. 
Avery's maternity leave was cut short, so she could go cover the collapse of Greece's banking system. 
Since inventing democracy, those guys have been coasting. 
So you're all alone with baby Liz? 
We're calling her Liddy, after Liddy Dole, G. Gordon Liddy, 
and my martial arts instructor Li Di. 
In addition, I have a huge presentation coming up. 
Meeting magazine is already calling it "the first great meeting of the decade." 
I have to be at my best. 
I'm negotiating NBC's licensing fees with Kabletown. 
But aren't NBC and Kabletown the same company now? 
That seems like a pretty big conflict of interest. 
Why would the government even allow that merger? 
It's okay. Don't worry. 
You just keep watching Bridalplasty. 
Alysinna died last week. 
Oh, damn it, I didn't leave my baby nurse her check this morning. 
I have to go back home and pay her. 
 Right now? 
 It's complicated. 
These women run your household, so you have to keep them happy, which means not saying anything as your DVR fills up with Trinidadian soap operas. 
But as soon as I'm out of the woods, Lemon, I'll take care of this latest dysfunction. 
There's nothing to take care of, Jack. 
Watch this. 
I can fit Emily Dickinson's whole head in my mouth. 
No. 
Oh, hey, Pete, what's up? 
Well, nobody told the musical guest that Tracy's in Africa, so all their instruments got delivered even though there's no show. 
Rock stars, man. 
People screaming your name, hot women throwing themselves at you. 
Living on a bus. 
Ha. 
I had all that once... 
For three months back in the early '80s. 
Really? 
What band were you in? 
 Everybody's workin' for the weekend  What? 
Yep. 
I was in Loverboy. 
But then I had to choose between staying in the band or taking that college scholarship to study TV budgeting. 
 Mmm. 
 I made my choice. 
That part of my life is over. 
Hey, it's never too late. 
What did you just say? 
 It's never too late   it's never too late for now   Yesterday's dreams are gone   but today I'm singin' this song   'cause it's never too late   it's never too late for now  We need to start a band. 
I think we just did. 
I'm sorry you had to wait for this, Sherry. 
I hope there was enough shark meat in the refrigerator for one of your sandwiches. 
Hold on, this is the same amount I was paying you when you worked full time, and now you're just working nights. 
It's my hourly rate. 
You understand my confusion. 
I'm actually paying you more money to be here half the time. 
I'm not saying that what you do isn't important. 
Avery and I appreciate you, and Liddy just adores you. 
But let's just say you're at the market, buying potatoes. 
And that ten-pound bag of potatoes costs... 
$400. 
But then the, uh, grocery concierge tells you that a five-pound bag of potatoes costs $400. 
Well, that would be shocking, right? 
Because a five-pound bag should only cost $200. 
What I'm saying is that we value what you do, but this rate is, uh, unreasonable. 
So, what you wan' do? 
I want to resolve this fairly and amicably. 
And I don't want any bad blood, so... 
It was nice negotiating with you, and, uh, here is all of your money. 
An impulsive murderer has been murdered. 
But in which of the two ways that I have suggested? 
In the simpler way by the mafioso disguised as a wagon-lit conductor? 
Or in the more complex way... 
Liz, enough! 
I am not gonna just sit and watch you plummet into spinsterhood. 
Why are you talking so fast? 
Because I'm upset! 
Also I've been taking these new Czechoslovakian organ-slimming pills. 
They contain a little bit of meth, which is something my body needs anyway. 
Listen, I'm not gonna let you wallow like this. 
I am taking you out so you can rebound...Sexually. 
What? No. 
Now, when I'm rebounding, I like to do it with an NBA player, because it's fun wordplay and they're mean. 
Well, thank you for that disgusting offer, but I will be in editing all night, putting together "The Best of Tracy Jordan" to replace this week's show, so can't go out. 
Too bad. 
Well, I'm not giving up. 
I didn't give up when Eric Roberts abandoned me in the desert, and I won't now. 
No judgment, Liz. 
Mr. Roberts 
thought I was dead. 
Oh. 
 It's never too late for now  Two, three... 
 It's never too late...  
 There you are. 
 Great. 
You just ruined a really boss take. 
We're recording a song called It's Never Too Late For Now. 
It's about that delicious little mystery I call life. 
Oh, my God, that sucks. 
Come on. 
We gotta go to editing. 
No, I'm not going to editing. 
I'm in here shredding away like a righteous ax master, and my arthritis is acting up. 
Do you have any ibuprofen? 
Uh, my fanny pack is in my office in my mini-fridge. 
I like my tampons to be cold. 
I'll be downstairs. 
Wait. "Hornberger-Rossitano"? 
Why is your name first? 
It's alphabetical. 
So what? 
So I'm the one who said, "it's never too late." 
I invented that. 
When we get up at the Grammys, I talk! 
Not you! 
Welcome to Brokeblack Mountain. 
You need to go black, Marty! 
This is Loz... Liz. 
This is Liz. 
Lemon, I am supposed to represent NBC in a negotiation that Rex Belcher the American Journal of meetings rated four chairs. 
Four. 
I'm sorry. Is that 
another magazine about meetings? 
Meanwhile, I just got worked over by my Trinidadian night nurse. 
I made every mistake you can in a negotiation. 
I spoke first, I smiled, I negotiated with myself. 
If I had done that during a mock negotiation in business school, professor Widmer would have spanked me in front of the whole class, bare bottom. 
Okay, but it's harder with someone like a nanny, right? 
There's an emotional component. 
She takes care of your baby. 
Lemon, you just had a structural, analytic insight. 
Professor Widmer would have given you a "good job" spanking. 
What is business school? 
The reason Sherry can manipulate me is because she has leverage. 
Eight pounds of screaming, toothless, soft-skulled leverage. 
Liddy loves Sherry, and Sherry assumes that I love Liddy. 
But you do, right? 
Yes. But Sherry 
can't prove that I love Liddy, so I renegotiate under new conditions, specifically, that I hate my newborn daughter. 
Wow, Jack. 
I could never pretend to hate my beautiful baby daughter, Emily Dickinson the cat. 
Oh, boy. 
Uh-oh. 
I don't feel so good. 
I think maybe I have food poisoning. 
Really? 'Cause I've 
never had a problem ordering from American sub restaurant very clean come in. 
I'm sorry. Could you just, 
um, leave your notes? 
I'll come in early tomorrow to finish! 
I guess this means you're free tonight after all. 
Where did you come from? 
It's a trick I developed to catch people talking about me behind my back. 
Did you know everyone thinks I'm insane? 
Now you have no excuse to stay in. 
Aw, come on, no! 
Jenna, you know how much I hate clubs and dance halls and odeons. 
They're all malarkey. 
Okay, what if I promise to find a place you like? 
And if I don't like it, I can leave? 
Yes, if you don't like it, you can leave. 
This isn't Eric Roberts' tepee. 
Ah, Sherry. 
Excellent. 
I've been thinking about our conversation earlier. 
It occurs to me that you are laboring under a fatal misapprehension. 
You think you have leverage over me, but you don't. 
I don't care about the baby. 
I've only known her for a few weeks, and other than a fondness for Avery's breasts, Liddy and I have nothing in common. 
She is one of two people ever to have thrown up on me, and I haven't spoken to Joe Namath since that Mardi Gras. 
What's more, I don't think Liddy looks like me, so evolutionarily, that makes me want to eat her. 
In other words, either you take a pay cut, or go and look for another job. 
Who has the leverage now, Sherry? 
Your move. 
Please stay. 
I'll send everyone in your family to college. 
Mm-hmm. 
So soft music, ample seating, and I know how much you like clearly marked fire exits. 
Don't worry. 
I'll find something to hate. 
Oh, okay, here we go. 
This sucks. 
This place is called "Canal Yards Project"? 
What does that mean? 
I don't know. 
It used to be a factory or something. 
Nope. 
Hipster nonsense. 
I'm out. 
No, you are not leaving because of the name. 
Excuse me, can I order two diet cranberry beach bangs, please? 
You got it. I'm gonna need 
to see your I.D., miss. 
How about this for I.D.? 
I participated in hands across America. 
Nerds. Where is it? 
Okay, my license is missing, which is my cue to go home. 
Excuse me. 
Is this yours? 
Oh, yeah. Thanks. 
I recognized your hair from across the room. 
What is that? 
Is that chestnut? 
Oh, the color is actually called "grandfather's shoe." 
Uh, can I get you a drink? 
I'm having white wine with ice cubes and sprite. 
That's my drink! 
I keep a thermos of it by my toilet! 
You misheard me. 
Okay. Uh, excuse me. 
Can I get two more of these, please? 
So did they make your droids wait outside too? 
Seriously, why can't droids go into the cantina? 
I mean, Ponda Baba can try to shoot Luke... 
but a protocol droid is somehow a problem. 
 Castles fall into the sand   could this really be God's plan?  
 or is it never too late?  
 it's never too late for now  Why can't I hear my vocals? 
I just mixed them down a little. 
I think it sounds better. 
Oh, really? 
Do you think that, or does she? 
This has nothing to do with Yuki. 
This is about making my song... 
Your song? 
All right, you know what? 
Forget it! 
Sound mound is finished! 
Which means I now have 5,000 t-shirts to un-order. 
Pete, like, 20 of these just came in for you. 
Damn it! 
I'm having a really nice time with you, Liz. 
Me, too, Anders. 
I like how you don't have one weird little tooth. 
Thank you. 
Look, I was gonna go back to my hotel room, get Eat Pray Love on Spectravision and make fun of it. 
Ew, Julia Roberts in a movie about eating? 
Give me Kirstie Alley, somebody who knows what she's doing. 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Oh, boy. 
That does sound fun, but... 
I really shouldn't. 
I came here with my friend, so I'm just gonna stay here. 
Get off me! My eye! 
It's a fight. 
Typical nightclub malarkey! 
Whoa. 
You okay? 
My heart's pounding like I'm watching Oprah's farewell season. 
I thought the stupid universe was telling me to get a cat and be a spinster, and now I don't know. 
What's it trying to tell me with you? 
Liz, look, I don't believe in signs or messages from the universe. 
You know what I do believe? 
It's never too late for now. 
 It's never, it's never   it's never, it's never   it's never too late   it's never too late for now  Every day we give you $100 for cat *** home. 
Do you realize what you're doing to me, Sherry? 
You're unraveling the very fabric of who I am. 
I negotiate for a living, and I never lose. 
And now I have to go negotiate with my colleagues at Kabletown after having been reamed by a woman wearing Winnie the Pooh hospital pants. 
I don't have what you have, Sherry. 
A brand-new baby that they've poured time and money and love into. 
Some helpless, pathetic, useless thing that would die if left alo... 
Oh, God, I do have that. 
I have NBC. 
Look, broadcast networks receiving licensing fees is unprecedented, Jack. 
But we're willing to offer NBC 10% of what we pay cable. 
I mean, okay, uh, not to negotiate against myself, but I get where you guys are coming from. 
Mm-hmm. 
Look, NBC is part of the Kabletown family now. 
It's our baby, and we want it to thrive. 
But your offer is... 
It's unreasonable! 
So what you wanna do? 
Oh, way to go, Liz! 
Attagirl! 
Walk of shame! 
You bow-legged bitch! 
Ah. I see you opened 
the scotch NBC sent us that week we came in third. 
I'm guessing your meeting went well. 
Homerun, Lemon. 
And, uh, speaking of baseball metaphors, I see that someone got to first base, which is what I consider sex with a stranger. 
Okay, fine. 
I had a one-night stand, and it was not the worst. 
And maybe you're right. 
I shouldn't give up just yet. 
Mm. 
Still, I can't believe I did that. 
And I wouldn't have if everything hadn't gone so perfectly. 
I mean, what if I had been stuck in the edit room all night, or if I hated the club and left? 
Or what if Anders... 
Yeah, Anders... 
hadn't found my license? 
Don't overthink it, Lemon. 
Stranger things happen every day. 
I once saw an Internet video of a mouse and a bird that are friends. 
Don't overthink it. 
Ah. 
Gasp. 
Last night, a repulsive act occurred at a hotel in midtown. 
There are two possible explanations as to how this event came to be... 
A simple one and a complex one. 
The simple explanation is that I went to a discotheque and a handsome, interesting man fell for me. 
In the wake of my breakup, I allowed myself to have an experience that gave me reason to be hopeful about the future again. 
Very simple. 
Great. 
I think we're done here. 
Please, monsieur. 
There remains, of course, the complex explanation... 
A vast conspiracy involving multiple agents and precise, coordinated efforts. 
A conspiracy that begins with the timely food poisoning of Donna Straunk. 
And who here has access to Donna's food? 
The second peculiar event... 
I lose my license, allowing it to be found by a handsome stranger. 
Serendipity? Perhaps. 
But how does one lose one's license out of a malfunction-proof Velcro Phillies sport wallet? 
Someone must have had access to my fanny pack. 
I only wanted ibuprofen. 
Then why is my ibuprofen bottle still sealed? 
Ah. 
And then there is the matter of the wine. 
Four glasses, and yet I was wide awake. 
Was my uncharacteristic energy perhaps due to the giddiness of the evening? 
Or was someone slipping me black market organ-slimming pills? 
Liz, I wouldn't... 
The conspiracy continues. 
What pushed me out of the club when I was wavering about leaving with Anders? 
Yeah, I came here with my friend, so I'm just gonna stay here. 
Aah! 
Yah! 
Get off of me! 
My eye! 
What, this? 
I got hit by a bird on a roller coaster. 
Even the club was strange. 
Almost as if it had been designed specifically for me, but who has the resources and the connections to create a Liz Lemon-themed club in one day? 
You had to sign your crime, didn't you? 
You're the one who gave me those moDVDs. 
And what was the final straw? 
It was Anders saying, "it's never too late for now," a coincidence that I took as a sign from the universe. 
Also, it's just a great song... 
that Pete wrote. 
Thanks, man. 
Sound mound rocks the town. 
Shut up, both of you. 
So how did Anders even know that phrase? 
How did Anders seem to know everything about me? 
It's white wine, ice cubes, and sprite. 
She calls it... 
Funky juice. 
I don't know if I want to do this. 
There's only one question I can't answer. 
Who was Anders? 
An old Harvard chum of Toofer's? 
The son of one of Jack's senator friends? 
He certainly wasn't a Swiss prostitute that Martha Stewart recommended to me. 
And that is the complex explanation. 
Of course, such a conspiracy would require a group of people who knew me so well and cared about my happiness so much that it's impossible to believe. 
No one could ever be that lucky. 
Which is why I choose the simple explanation. 
I choose to believe that last night Liz Lemon went out, got some, and felt good about it. 
And so I say good-bye to spinsterhood. 
Good-bye to giving up and to... 
Oh, God, a hawk got her! 
Emily Dickinson! 
 'Cause she's a weekend lady   she's got that weekend style   temperature's risin'   she's gonna make you smile   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, unh, unh, unh.  
 ***   ***   *** Weekend woman!  
﻿1 Hey, yo! 
Back that... 
And you can... 
While I... 
Off your... 
Disgusting, sir! 
Would you talk like that to your mother or your daughter or your surgeon? 
Just because my friend is blonde and never closes her mouth fully... 
hey, I wasn't talking to her. 
I was talking to you, glasses. 
I bet you have... 
...Infected penis. 
That has never happened to me before. 
Well, I'm not surprised. 
Not because you're not cute. 
You are... 
like a pretty refugee on the news. 
It's because you've always put out this negative energy. 
But now that you're with someone, you're happy and confident. 
Guys can sense that. 
Confident, huh? 
So can I finally wear that cowboy hat I bought at Kiss-FM's lake jam '97? 
Um...The point is, 
being with someone makes people want to be with you. 
You know, when it rains, it pours. 
I want your feet in my mouth. 
When it rains, it pours. 
Hello, "Javery." 
Time-saver. 
Lemon, we have news. 
Like God, I created man. 
We're having a boy. 
That's great. 
Congratulations. 
Think about it, Liz. 
Every woman my boy dates will get compared to me, and they will be found wanting. 
He's very lucky to have you as his mother. 
I'll tell you why he's lucky. 
He's got an old dad. 
I'm sorry? 
I had an old dad. 
It was awesome. 
I could get away with anything. 
This is just what I need... 
To store my rock collection. 
Lemon, I'm not an old dad. 
50 is the new 40... 
For men. 
But 50 is still 60 for women. 
Whatevs, Tony Randall. 
Whatevs, indeed, because that makes you Jack Klugman. 
Damn! I'm a writer. 
I'm messy. 
I'm a loveable curmudgeon. 
That is solid! 
Advantage, Donaghy. 
Hmm. 
Rundowns are already out. 
I can't believe how smoothly everything's going without Kenneth here. 
I know. 
Do you remember my tattoo mishap? 
It was supposed to say "peace," but they wrote "white hooker" instead. 
I forgot I was getting it removed today, but someone slipped a note under my door to remind me. 
Well, no one could ever replace Kenneth, but these new kids are getting it done. 
 Mmhmm. 
Liz, Tracy will not be coming out of his dressing room today. 
Oh, come on! 
What now? 
 I'm "werewolfing" myself. 
 Sure. 
You know when a dude knows he's gonna turn into a werewolf and locks himself into a jail? 
Well, I'm embarrassed to say I've missed the birth of both of my sons for very legitimate reasons. 
 Cooking a Frenchbread pizza and forgot. 
So I promised Angie I will not miss the birth of our daughter. 
She was due yesterday, so we're not taking any chances. 
Grizz is guarding the other door... 
And reading. 
Also, we took Tracy's cell phone,  his wallet... 
 And my mood ring! 
And I don't know how I feel about that. 
Well, I'm glad you're gonna be there for Angie. 
Good for you. 
And good for you, Liz Lemon. 
There's something about you lately, make me want to put my feet in your mouth. 
 It's your turn. 
 What? 
Editing hasn't sent up the title sequence yet, and it's your turn to go down there. 
God, I hate how much power they have over us. 
Who do they think they are... 
mommy and her sisters? 
Jeez, calm down. 
They know we need them, so they torture us. 
How's it going? 
I'm done, actually. 
Okay, you know what? 
I will take care of editing from now on. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
I'll go down there, turn on the new Liz Lemon charm, a little Julia Roberts laugh... 
Ha ha ha! 
 What's in your teeth? 
 Corn. 
70, Lemon. 
I will be 70 years old when my son graduates prep school. 
 Oh, come on. 
Is this about my old-dad thing? 
I was joking. 
Will I even be there for his first subpoena? 
Will I ever experience the father-son bonding of realizing you were both at the same masked orgy in a castle? 
I will be senile... 
Or dead for the better part of my child's life. 
Am I pulling this off? 
I cannot escape death, Lemon, but I will cheat it. 
Whatever happens to me, I must find a way to speak to... 
And guide my son, even from the grave. 
Woo... 
This is a test of the fire system. 
Please evacuate the building. 
You coming downstairs? 
And stand outside in a crowd like some Italian? 
I don't think so. 
You know, as floor fire marshal, Kenneth always ran the fire drills. 
Who's doing it now? 
One of the new kids, I guess. 
This is a fire drill. 
All NBC employees exit to the Plaza. 
I can't leave my dressing room until Angie goes into labor. 
But the president is saying we have to go outside. 
It's okay, Tray. 
We'll all go down together. 
Then we'll bring you back up. 
Just stay with your grown-up. 
If I were a real werewolf, I'd wear baggy clothes so my nice clothes wouldn't get all torn up. 
Same rule for if I were the hulk. 
I don't get why people like brunch. 
What's the benefit of combining break dancing and lunch? 
Tray? 
You're not Grizz! 
Ah! 
 Hello? 
 I'm at the damn hospital! 
Where is Tracy? 
What? 
Good morning. 
Now, full disclosure... 
most of my experience is putting babies in women. 
Oh. 
I'ma kill that man. 
You just described my morning. 
Now, Mrs. Jordan, 
I've already administered the epidural. 
So would you like one as well? 
 I am trying to help you. 
My son... 
You may not remember me. 
I am your father. 
This message is coming to you either from beyond the grave or because I am in the grip of insanity. 
The purpose of these DVDs is to educate and guide you through life in my absence. 
I will begin with our shared history. 
The Donaghys originally come from Ireland's little known county Steve, where, historically, we were whiskey testers and goblins. 
I was raised in Sadchester, Massachusetts, I won the amory blaine handsomeness scholarship to Princeton and then attended Harvard business school where I was voted "most." 
I once hit a stand-up triple off Fidel Castro. 
I was the first person ever to say, "I need a vacation from this vacation." 
The song you're so vain was, in fact, written by me. 
In other words, I have lived. 
In living, I have learned. 
And now I want to impart that knowledge to you. 
I will begin with the basics. 
You are hiking in the Japanese highlands. 
A pair of snow leopards is stalking you, and the blade of your katana is frosted into its scabbard. 
What? 
What's up, edit seven gang? 
Ritchie, Donna, Ray... 
Split the difference, but keep the music where it is. 
 What are you guys working on? 
 Piece for the today show about how next month is October. 
Islanders, huh? 
So you think they're gonna end up trading... 
Francen fren? 
Who, Matt Moulson? 
They should. 
I'm better than that clown. 
 So you play? 
 Do I play? 
I go to islanders fantasy camp every year. 
 You must be a strong skater. 
 Well, I can't go backwards. 
But, yeah, I'm good. 
 Were you in the army? 
 Oh. No. 
Better... 
civil war reenactor. 
Kind of an expert at getting shot by, uh, smooth-bore firearms, you know? 
Like... kah, kah! 
Kah, kah, kah, kow! 
Blah, hah! 
Gah! Kaw! Kah! 
Kaw, kaw! 
Ah, death to Lincoln! 
 Oh, so a southern gentleman. 
 Oh, yeah. 
Well, thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Ritchie! 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Cool hat, by the way. 
Hey, uh, you know what? 
Let's switch to the other deck. 
I forgot I got to get those TGS titles done for Liz here. 
I just got to get to the hospital and wait there! 
Taxi! 
Sir... 
I don't have any money, but I need to get to Mount Sinai Hospital. 
No problem. 
Hop in. 
Wow. It's like 
I always say... 
"white cab drivers are weird." 
You're in the cash cab. 
It's a TV game show that takes place right here in my taxi. 
Explain the rules. 
You answer trivia questions for money and a free ride. 
But if you answer incorrectly, the game is over, and you're out of the cab. 
So for me to be there at the birth of my daughter, I have to answer trivia questions, despite having gone to middle school in an exxon station? 
Yeah. 
You ready to play? 
Bring it! 
Your main titles, milady. 
 Aha. 
 And this... 
Is a cd of some civil war songs I thought you'd like. 
It's very authentic. 
So don't play it around your black friends. 
Well, thanks, Ritchie. 
 Mmhmm. 
Okay. 
Oh! 
Wow, this is a nice hug. 
Two becoming one, hmm? 
Bam! 
Blah! 
What the hell, Liz? 
I thought Ritchie was lying. 
You know, if you wanted to cheat on Carol with an Italian dude who smells like cigarettes, I've made it very clear I would flip over my futon for you. 
Not cool! 
What is he talking about? 
Okay. 
It's not a big deal. 
Ritchie has just been telling the crew that you two are sleeping together. 
 What? 
 Your new vibe is a double-edged sword... 
much like the kind Mickey Rourke tried to kill me with. 
Great. 
So that's what I get for being happy, for being nice, and rocking a cowboy hat that a Kiss-FM DJ once called a "sweet lid"? 
But you can't say anything to him. 
Are you kidding me? 
If you do, he'll take it out on TGS, on us! 
I'll be here waiting for edits till 4:00 in the morning when I should be at home... 
Which is the name of a bar I found near the train station. 
I'm sorry. You want me 
to just take this for the team? 
Please. You know he can make 
our lives a living hell. 
We all make sacrifices, Liz. 
I had to be at work this morning at 11:00. 
Fine. 
Fine. 
Oh... 
You got sauce on me! 
You know, neighbors who wear my exact size don't die every day! 
A gift from France to the United States, the statute of liberty was completed in what year? 
Come on, I don't know that. 
You've got 15 seconds, or you're out of the cab. 
Okay. 
I remember going to the Statue of Liberty Centennial, 'cause that year someone had spread a rumor that she was gonna slip out of her toga, and I wanted to see some green boobies. 
And the mets had just won the world series, 'cause that night, I was randomly attacked by a Mets fan that I had threw a bottle at. 
That was 1986. 
And centennial is 100 years, because "centipeding" means having sex with 100 women. 
I got it! 
1886! 
Yes! 
That is correct. 
Weighing up to 4 tons, what type of mammal is the famous shamu? 
She is an orca, Benjamin. 
Fyi, they're very difficult to keep in a home aquarium. 
 Right again! 
 I'm coming, Angie! 
Son, I may not be there for your wedding. 
It breaks my heart to realize that. 
But I want to offer you one piece of fatherly advice. 
Do not hire sting to play the reception. 
He'll insist on doing jazz versions of police songs, and it's just... 
Demoralizing. 
After I'm gone, your mother may meet someone else. 
I want her to be happy, so... 
His death must appear to be accidental. 
The secret to a strong, healthy head of hair is dove...Blood. 
Remember, the backflip is 90% confidence. 
Kenneth, what are you doing here? 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I was just sweeping your terrace, and then you came in, and I was trapped. 
Just like the time I was cleaning my closet, and my mom and her friend Ron came in to take one of their grunting naps on my bed... 
hang on. 
Are you sneaking in here and working? 
I know how much you all need me... 
stop right there. 
Guess what. 
Other people can figure out how to sort the mail and answer the phones... 
we don't need you. 
So move on with your life, starting now. 
That is called tough love. 
Kenneth is now on a journey that will either return him here where he belongs or end... 
In his death. 
Juggling is easier than it looks. 
No. It is true. 
They're doing it. 
Oh. 
And we have this just in to us. 
Ritchie and Liz spotted in tree. 
Eyewitnesses report K-I-S-S-I-N-G. 
For more, let's go to NBC's Andrea Mitchell. 
Thank you, Brian. 
Slut. 
Who do you think you are? 
Ritchie Tamuto, islanders fan and role-playing slave owner. 
I know what you've been saying about me... 
that we're sleeping together? 
You know what, Ritchie? 
I'm actually seeing someone right now, and he's never around, 'cause he's a pilot. 
His name is Carol. 
That sounds really fake. 
I know how it sounds. 
And Carol is the reason I was nice to you, because for once in my life, I felt like being nice. 
Well, I don't care how you punish my show. 
It's over. 
I take my hug back. 
No, l-Liz, that is not why I did it. 
Oh, "reallo"? 
I meant to say "really." 
I misspoke. 
Continue. 
Oh. 
Come here, come here, come here. 
Liz, are you familiar with the phrase "when it rains, it pours"? 
I don't meet a lot of women. 
Now, I started doing fantasy hockey camp and civil war re-creationism to meet girls. 
But I don't know where they are. 
So...Yes. 
When you were nice to me, I took advantage of it to try to make someone else notice. 
Who? 
My assistant editor... 
Donna. 
Oh, for seven years, I've been sitting close enough to touch her... 
But a million miles away. 
I am really sorry that I did what I did. 
But it's just that I am in love with her. 
I love her so much. 
Oh, Donna! 
Donna Straunk! 
All right, I'll make you a deal. 
So many memories. 
Hello. Parcell 
and a squatter's residence. 
Where the hell is Tracy Jordan! 
Mrs. Jordan? 
Oh, I don't... 
I'm out of my mind on a lot of drugs right now. 
Drugs during childbirth? 
Isn't the whole point feeling God punish you? 
If that man is not here for this, it is over! 
You hear me? 
The lazy Susan was invented by Thomas Jefferson. 
I know, 'cause I'm a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and lazy Susan herself! 
The capital of the United Arab Emirates is Abu Dhabi. 
I know that, because if I go back there, I'll be executed. 
There are 12 tones in the chromatic scale. 
 I know that because I'm a musical genius   This is how you throw a punch. 
 Wait... what? 
"And the tree was happy." 
Shel silverstein was a communist. 
And that... 
Is the art of camouflage. 
And this is how you make love to a woman. 
Aah! 
Aah! 
Pull, Angie, pull! 
I knew you wouldn't let me down, baby. 
Of course not, woman. 
I'm your husband. 
Damn it! 
I got to go feed the meter. 
Aah! 
Aah! 
Oh, hey, Ritchie. 
Are we still on for the music concert this weekend? 
Liz, we need to talk... 
About us. 
Liz, we've had a lot of fun. 
End it? Why? 
But I need to end it. 
End it? Why? 
Without you around, who's gonna satisfy my sex needs... and then some? 
Oh, Liz... 
You'll find someone. 
No, I won't, not someone like you. 
How many guys out there have a fully loaded Toyota tercel or a real pinball machine? 
How many guys have been to Canada... 
Twice? 
Are you doing this to me because I don't share your love of unicorns? 
Oh, Liz, don't blame yourself. 
It's my fault. 
See you in another life, kiddo. 
I guess some other woman will get to enjoy that water bed that you're saving up for. 
What's up, Ritchie? 
Congratulations. 
We're here, Tracy. 
You made it! 
Tracy Jordan... hero, 
husband, diabetic/alcoholic! 
Yes! 
Hold on. 
Let me unlock it for ya. 
Am I pulling it right? 
 Just let go of the handle. 
 Okay. 
It's still not opening. 
Stop pulling it. 
I'm trying to pull. 
You keep saying "pull." 
Tracy, if you're pulling on it while I'm hitting the button... 
What do you want me to do? 
Yelling at me ain't gonna make it better! 
 Stop pulling on it! 
 I'm freaking out! 
Good God! 
What's wrong with it? 
Oh, it's upside down. 
My bad. 
Well, Angie, you did it. 
We did it. 
I was here for you... 
'Cause I love you, baby. 
And I will always be by your side no matter what discovery channel game show stands in my way. 
I wouldn't have missed whatever just happened here for anything. 
I don't know what I'd do without you. 
And I mean it. 
Why's that baby covered with goop? 
'Cause everything about this is disgusting. 
As you go through life, I will always be here for you through these tapes. 
Also, I have given a great deal of money to the catholic church and have been assured that I will have certain powers in heaven... 
sending messages through animals, for instance. 
In the unlikely event that you encounter something that is not covered here, find a woman named Elizabeth Lemon, get her advice, and then do the opposite. 
Mr. Donaghy, I am sorry, 
but you are wrong, sir. 
I am needed here... 
More than I ever knew. 
Very well. 
I'll let h.R. Know. 
No, sir. 
If I'm going to return, it must be through the proper channels. 
I'm going to reapply to the NBC page program, following standard procedures for acceptance. 
You do whatever you want to, Kenneth. 
I won't let you down, sir. 
I really don't care. 
Your ability to hide your true feelings is part of your great strength. 
You ready for this, Jackie d? 
As of today, yes. 
I made all my videotapes. 
Explain. 
I'm not gonna be around forever, Tracy, so I recorded advice for every scenario my son could face. 
Jackie D, you want to make God laugh? 
Make a plan... 
Or read him a Dave Barry book. 
You're worrying about being old, Jack? 
You could live forever, but you still can't predict what happens in life. 
Wait a minute. 
There's no baby in here. 
Good God! 
Oh, she's in the crib. 
Good. 
Avery, I'm with Tracy. 
 We're having a damn girl! 
 What? 
That Russian skank read the ultrasound wrong. 
Oh! I'm just so worried 
about her spatial reasoning and upper-body strength. 
Jack, talk me down. 
I'm having a girl! 
I hate to say I told you so... 
So welcome to Miami. 
I've gotta make new tapes. 
My daughter... 
I am John Francis Donaghy. 
I am your father. 
If you have the blondness and self-esteem of your mother, you will need no advice. 
Life will be easy for you. 
Otherwise, I'd like to introduce you to... 
Elizabeth Lemon. 
Good afternoon. 
Let's jump in. 
Every human has hair on his or her face. 
Some of us just have more. 
I think it's nice to occasionally splurge on a straight-razor shave. 
If you're running low on laundry, a bathing suit makes perfectly acceptable underwear. 
Bandanas are a fun, sexy fashion accessory. 
 This is over. 
 Let me give my reasons. 
Put potato chips on a sandwich! 
﻿1 Alright! 
Now that the popsicle's mounted, we've got ourselves a tongue depressor I want you to look at these cold sores... 
I get them when I'm stressed-out Nothing to be ashamed of... 
I get them from prostitutes. 
It's been a hard couple of months, Work has been crazy, and I went through a bad breakup. 
And then there was this plastic bag that represented my death... 
sounds like you could use a little R&R... 
Rum and ritalin. 
Actually, I was hoping you'd just have an ointment  for my mouth. 
 Gross. 
'Cause I'm dealing with the stress thing. 
Over the break-up, I'm renting a cottage out in the Hamptons. 
There's just four things I want to do this summer... 
be outdoors, wear shapeless clothing, do some mindless activity like gardening, and learn Spanish. 
There are four things I want to do this summer. 
But they're roommates, so it's tricky. 
All right, here is a prescription for your cold sores, and here's a blank one for the weekend. 
Now, one final thing. 
Why aren't you wearing pants? 
The other doctor told me to take them off. 
Other doctor? 
That's my brother Randy. 
Tomorrow he's going to jail for the rest of his life. 
Good one, Randy! 
Hey, you want to go to taco bell for lunch? 
 Hey... 
 Stop right there. 
I know that people are feeling sorry for me because my wife was kidnapped by Kim Jong-Il. 
 I know... 
 But I do not need your pity. 
And I am tired of hearing that tone of voice. 
 Aw... 
 Hey... 
Hey, buddy... 
Hey, I know what you're going through. 
I once kidnapped a woman. 
I know... 
 Stop talking like that, Lemon. 
 I'm trying to, but I'm kind of locked in, sweetie. 
The voice is controlling me now. 
Help me? 
Look, obviously this has been difficult. 
I'm not sleeping. 
Last night I sat in front of the TV and ate an entire carton of foie gras. 
I can hardly drink my morning shower scotch. 
I miss Avery. 
It's the little things I miss most. 
On a day like this, we would go to Strawberry Fields in Central Park and kick hippies' hacky sacks into the bushes. 
Look, you need to reset and try to feel normal again. 
Normal? I don't know 
what normal is anymore. 
"Normal" is a woman and a woman getting married and having a child. 
 What? 
 Is me being a bummer helping you feel like your old self? 
 Keep going. 
 Bush is a war criminal! 
There's so much texting going on these days and no communicating. 
Carbon tax! 
Please leave! 
That's the spirit. 
Well, I'm off. 
 Have a good summer, Jenna. 
 Oh, I will. 
Do you remember when I performed during halftime at the Wool Bowl? 
It was on ESPN-34. 
 You can't spell "America"   without w-o-o-l   it's all better in wool  A singer, everyone! 
Woolly the wool mascot, everybody! 
The sponsors were so happy with me they're now naming me the new celebrity face of wool. 
How exciting! 
Every year my aunt sends me a wool sweater for Christmas. 
We get it, Aunt Alice. 
You're a sheep. 
Also, this is very lucrative. 
Paul and I can finally buy that timeshare in Betasten Bos, Amsterdam's premier private sex garden. 
They have genetically altered men there with minotaur heads that chase you through the brambles. 
Okay. Well, good-bye, 
my closest female friend. 
Oh, my God. 
The season's over. 
Why are you losers still here? 
Final melee, Liz. 
It's the last game of the season and no one wants to lose. 
You have no summer plans? 
Well, David Eggers and I are designing a new font. 
Ugh, shut up. 
Frank, you have a girlfriend. 
And Lynn wants me to give up video games 'cause she thinks I need to grow up. 
How's this for growing up? 
Last night for dinner I put milk in my Apple Jacks. 
Ha! I distracted you, 
and you died. 
 Game over. 
 No, I shot my bazooka at the ground to kill myself 'cause Toofer had me cornered. 
Now I respawn and start over. 
So you're killing yourself rather than let someone else win? 
That's why everyone has zero kills and we've been playing for 18 hours. 
I'm wearing a diaper, like a baby would. 
Wow. I can't wait 
to get out of here. 
For three months. 
It's gonna be glorious. 
  Mmm. 
Hi, neighbor. 
II'm ina Garten. 
You know, my husband Jeffrey is away, and I've got some bruschetta and white wine open. 
 Why don't you come over? 
 I'm alive! 
All I have left is to pay the fine that I incurred for committing a hate crime against what the city is now claiming was a Jewish tree. 
And I'm free. 
Have a great summer. 
I'm not one for good-bye speeches, but I do feel... 
Lutz, what are you doing? 
Don't look at me. 
Mm. 
Jenna, this is a great day for the wool council. 
Well, I am very proud to be your new spokeswoman. 
You know, in the past, I was the face of Clinique, a French-Canadian anal rejuvenation clinic. 
And I was the feet of filthylittlefeet.com. 
Yes, well, about that. 
Jenna... 
Wool is a wholesome fabric, which is why your contract includes a morality clause. 
You will be required to conduct your personal life in manner which is consistent with the values of this industry. 
Oh, of course. 
We're just a little worried about publicity like this. 
No, Eugene, that's not just some guy I picked up at a dog bar. 
Paul and I are in a committed relationship. 
Is he a cross dresser? 
Goodness, no! 
Paul is a gender-dysmorphic bigenitalian pansexualle. 
I see. 
Maybe we should take a few days and think about this. 
No. Whenever men say that, 
I never see them again. 
You just need to meet Paul. 
Our relationship is everything that wool is about... 
love, warmth, chafed skin. 
 Oh, noble sheep   we eat your babies   we use your brain   to fight off rabies   but the most beautiful gift you give us   is wool  All right, Jenna. 
I'd love to meet Paul. 
Let's say dinner tomorrow night at your place. 
I'll bring my wife. 
Excellent. 
I should warn you... 
This had better be a very normal dinner. 
No hijinks, no farce, and not just for the sake of your relationship with the National Wool Council, but for the sake of my wife, whose parents were killed in front of her while an episode Three's Company was... 
You know what? I'll let her 
tell the story at dinner. 
Wool-come, Jenna. 
Sherry, who was at the door? 
Kenneth, what are you doing? 
Well, I know your wife was kidnapped by some convenience store owners, and I'm real sorry about that. 
I'm not looking for pity. 
Pity? Oh, sir, 
back in Stone Mountain, people lose their spouses all the time. 
Mumps, hill people attacks, cave collapses, both business and residential. 
Continuing my list... 
Kenneth, what do you want? 
When someone needs help, we don't waste time feeling sorry for 'em. 
We help them. 
And you seem like you could use a home-cooked meal. 
Oh, that smells delicious. 
It's an old Parcell family recipe. 
But I like to replace the Union soldier meat with boiled potatoes. 
I haven't eaten at this table since Avery's been gone. 
That was her chair. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 No, please sit. 
You two have similar-shaped buttocks. 
Deer God, thank you for this venison. 
Onion god, thank you for these onions. 
Carrot god, thank you for the carrots. 
Spanish for older women, lesson 12. 
Emergencies. 
"Disaster approaching." 
Desastre inminente. 
Desastre inminente. 
Fore! 
 What? 
 Oh, my God! 
Liz? It's Tracy! 
From work! 
What are you doing here? 
I just bought everything around this house. 
It's supposed to be a nice area, except for the "new element" everyone keeps talking about. 
Look, I got a long night of shooting guns in the air ahead of me. 
Do you mind if I take a nap here? 
Of course! 
You're my neighbor. 
I wanted a normal summer, and chaos is my normal. 
If I start screaming in my sleep, do not wake me up! 
I will attack you! 
Wake me up! 
Free me from this! 
Ah, Kenneth... 
Thank you for dinner last night. 
It was nice to hear a woman's laugh in the house again. 
You're bad. 
I thought maybe we could do it again tonight. 
Oh, sir, I'd love to, but I can't. 
 Why not? 
 Well, I have to work. 
Now that the crew is gone, I like to give everything a good spring cleaning, starting in the bathroom. 
There's a lot of drawings of Ms. Maroney eating celery 
that men are giving to her with their hips. 
I see. 
Well, another time, perhaps. 
I'll just be alone... 
In a house full of memories. 
My house is full of white cockroaches. 
Hi, sweetie! 
I got you an early anniversary present. 
It's a new leash for when I walk you through the park like a dog. 
The weather's supposed to be nice and muddy tomorrow... 
 What's wrong? 
 Look... 
I'm the face of wool now. 
I need to maintain a certain image. 
So, what, we can't be ourselves? 
Just not in public. 
We can do whatever we want here. 
Except tonight. 
Mr. Gremby is coming over 
for dinner. 
Eugene Gremby from the wool council? 
 Tonight? 
 I just want him to meet you and see us together. 
Then he'll get it. 
He'll understand what we have. 
But the Grembys are pretty conservative. 
Maybe you should change. 
Really? This is 
a conservative top, Jenna. 
And I hate to be the stereotypical man, but this is my home and I wanna wear this blouse. 
Paul, please. 
You need to change. 
Okay, I'll change. 
And I'll cancel the sitter for tonight, tell him he won't need to come sit on us after all. 
Oh, you just made a very dangerous enemy, Kenneth. 
Thanks for the heads-up, Jonathan. 
Do you wanna come to my birthday party? 
What are you doing? 
That's my job. 
Uh, Jonathan volunteered to clean up so you could come over again tonight, right, Jonathan? 
But, sir, it's not just the bathrooms that need cleaning. 
That's why Jonathan's family is here. 
Uh, Liddy goes down at 7:00, so I'll see you then. 
Oh, my. 
Liz Lemon. 
Any idea when your party will be over, tray? 
The party hasn't started. 
That's just the guys setting up. 
Could I borrow a cup of sugar? 
I'm trying to get a hummingbird to drink out of my penis. 
I can't do this, Tracy. 
This is supposed to be my vacation. 
I wanted to spend it learning Spanish, not living next door to you. 
I give up. Of course I'm not 
allowed to be a human being. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
You didn't wanna live next door to your friend after all I've done for you? 
How many times have I come over and painted your apartment? 
Three! And by the way, 
stop doing that. 
Or maybe you're saying we're not friends. 
That's fine. 
I don't think it'll affect my behavior next season. 
"The sad woman has been trapped by the idiot." 
La mujer triste... 
We're friends. 
Next year's gonna be fine, 'cause we're good friends. 
We're sp... 
spending the summer together. 
Great! I'll come over 
tomorrow morning! 
Okay, well, since you've just been staring at me like that for the last 20 minutes, I'm gonna scoot on out of here. 
Don't go, Avery. 
Uh, I mean Kenneth. 
Sir. 
You called me "Avery." 
That's your kidnapped wife's name. 
What a coincidence! 
I haven't slept in days. 
I'm not really feeling like myself. 
You know, in the evening, Avery and I would sit together and talk. 
It was a nice way to unwind. 
Well, I bet you miss... 
Put on these earrings. 
So...Tell me 
about your day. 
Well, I got a soft yes from Jonathan about my birthday party. 
Then I went to a very uncomfortable dinner. 
Do you know what I did today? 
Tried to be strong, sat alone with my thoughts, then... 
I went to a wonderful dinner. 
Then the dinner ended? 
No. 
So, Paul, what do you do? 
I am in the restaurant business, and I really love... 
Golf-playing. 
Is that so? 
What's your handicap? 
Oh, well, I don't have one myself, but I do like a girl with a limp. 
Oh, Paul. 
So, Mrs. Gremby, 
you're also named "Eugene"? 
Oh, no, dear. 
It's "u" period "Jean." 
My first name is U. Jean 
with a "u." 
Oh, that's a nice blouse. 
It definitely goes with your eyes, don't you think, Jenna? 
Golf, blouses. 
I'm just so impressed with how normal this dinner has been. 
Very wool! 
Greetings, slaves! 
Who's ready to get sat on? 
Uh, sir, I don't know who you are, but you are not wanted here. 
Didn't you get my text? 
I thought it was part of the game. 
We are good people who have no interest in being sat on! 
So don't spew your statistics on the health benefits of weekly sittings or its wide acceptance in eastern cultures. 
 Paul. 
 We're normal! 
And being normal is American, and it's respectable, and it makes us... 
Happy. 
Now get out of here. 
Well done, sir. 
Bravo. 
You handled that pervert with aplomb. 
Very wool. 
To tomorrow's photo shoot and wool. 
Shh! Shh, shh, shh. 
Unbelievable... 
you're still here. 
It's still zero, zero, zero. 
To zero. 
I did it. 
I spoke. 
This didn't get mailed. 
What are you doing here? 
Shouldn't you be out in the Hamptons not getting invited to stuff? 
I came back for the day. 
Tracy lives next door to me. 
I can't leave, I can't stay. 
I'm trapped. 
Speaking of trapped, I got you, Lutz! 
Nope, grenade. 
Blowing myself up. 
Oh, my God. 
That's what I have to do. 
I can be a normal person. 
I have to blow myself up. 
No, your honor, I'm not disputing the fine. 
I'm refusing to pay it. 
Grenade, respawn. 
Miss... I mean, ma'am, 
read the fine print. 
If you don't pay, I can sentence you to up to three weeks of community service. 
How about three months? 
This is a sham, your dis-honor. 
Nay, a mockery! 
I've put the system on trial. 
You can't handle the truth. 
I'm out of order? 
You're out of order. 
Victor Sifuentes! 
Hoo-ah! 
Gavel, gavel, gavel! 
I lost my gavel over the weekend, but it doesn't mean you can talk to me like that. 
Talk to who? 
I just see an empty robe. 
Do you honestly not see me, or are you being rude? 
 I am being rude. 
 That's it. 
Twelve weeks of community service. 
You'll spend your whole summer picking up trash. 
Gavel, gavel, gavel! 
Freedom! 
For me. 
Probably not you guys. 
Mr. Donaghy, 
where are my clothes? 
Sherry must've put them in the wash while you were showering. 
Now, give us a twirl. 
This is not right, sir. 
Now, what do you say you put on some of Avery's perfume and we head over to Strawberry Fields and whip pennies at the drum circle? 
I don't like to swear, sir, but, no, thank you. 
Now, maybe I haven't had a wife who was kidnapped, but I have seen the Brady Bunch where Tiger runs away. 
We've all been through some bad stuff, Mr. Donaghy. 
I had the perfect woman. 
Gorgeous. 
Brilliant. 
Always let me be the hat in Monopoly. 
Why is this happening to me? 
God, are you punishing me because my hair is better than yours? 
All right, sir, enough. 
You wanted me to be Mrs. Donaghy? 
Well, I know Mrs. Donaghy, 
and she is mean. 
She once made Rahm Emanuel cry in an airport lounge. 
So fine. 
I will be Mrs. Donaghy. 
And I'm gonna say... 
Listen to me, Jack. 
You don't want people to pity you? 
Well, they should, because you're pitiful. 
You think you're all alone. 
"Boo-hoo, why can't my life be the way it was?" 
Well, it can't. 
And you're not alone. 
You have a daughter you should be spending time with instead of being weird to Kenneth. 
He may be a chinless piece of human garbage, but he will never fill the void that I left behind. 
Oh, look, here he comes now. 
He's gonna ask me to go to his birthday party. 
"Hi, 'Mrs. Don'gy.' 
you wan' come on down my birfday party?" 
No, I can't, but I know Jack can. 
Kenneth, Kenneth, I get it. 
Uh, Sherry? 
Put Liddy's baby pantsuit on. 
I'm taking her to work with me today. 
All right, Mr. Donaghy. 
And, uh, thank you. 
Avery. 
Here's to you, Jenna Maroney. 
Even with your back to me, I can definitely tell it's you. 
I'll turn around later. 
Perfect. 
I'll keep talking. 
Mm, wool. 
You know, my wife U. Jean 
is out of town visiting her parents' graves. 
Maybe we could meet later for a drink and you could show me your front. 
We could do that... 
Now! 
Paul? 
And Jenna. 
Oh, my God! 
I'm finally taking a stand... 
After all these days. 
You wanted us to be normal. 
Well, this is our normal, and this is what we think of your morality clause. 
Mm, give mommy some beard. 
Ugh! 
Oh, you got some crumbs in here. 
Oh, eat it. 
Good God! Lemon? 
Liddy, say "good God, Lemon." 
Goo gah, Lem. 
I did it, Jack. 
I got my dream vacation! 
You're on a chain gang. 
I'm outdoors, I'm wearing comfortable clothes, I'm gardening, and I'm learning Spanish! 
Uh, Liddy and I just went to strawberry fields, where she spat up on a white lady's dreads. 
It's nice to see that we're back to our version of normal. 
 Jenna? 
 Oh, Jenna, no. 
There you are! 
Bad dog! 
You'll go in the crate tonight. 
 Grr. 
 Ew. 
Hey, Jack. 
Hey, Liz. 
Ow! 
Fore! 
Hey, guys! 
It's me! Tracy! 
The black guy from work. 
What are you doing? 
I hooked a ball onto a truck on the Long Island Expressway. 
And Tracy Jordan does not take Mulligans. 
Good thing you had to move out of that house. 
Some idiot rammed his boat that I was driving into it. 
You see all the good that is in them, how much capacity for love? 
Yes, I know. 
I just need more time with them. 
Give me more time, Jacob, I beg of you! 
Go, I see you... 
I'm killing myself. 
Respawn. 
Respawn. 
Oh... 
Dammit! 
Hola, everyone! 
Are you ready for Season 6? 
And we moved the files from your old computer over for free. 
Oh, my God. 
Wait... 
How long have we've been here? 
Listen, Greg, I've got the next big reality show. 
We put a bunch of people on a plane, fly them over the Atlantic, then Tom Bergeron comes out and reveals that the pilot is a six-year-old boy. 
We call it "Child Hell Flight." 
Get out of here! 
 He is pitching a nohitter. 
 What? 
Starting at 4:00 P.M. yesterday, 
when Mr. Donaghy coined 
the word "innoventually,"  he has been flawless. 
 So why do I have to leave? 
Because you have so many unsolvable problems, like your mouth. 
It looks like somebody kicked a hole in a bag of flour. 
 Ow! 
Good news, Jonathan. 
"Child hell flight" will "innoventually" be on the spring schedule. 
Oh! 
Congratulations, sir. 
Miss Lemon was just leaving. 
Oh, no. 
Lemon, please come in. 
When you're pitching a perfect game, you don't walk Albert Pujols and you are the Albert Pujols of having problems. 
Perfect game, huh? 
I haven't done a single thing wrong in almost 24 hours, and I'm including sex last night. 
Here's Avery's thank-you note. 
Ugh! 
She likes that? 
No, but she respects it when it's done correctly. 
Lemon, you may be witnessing history here. 
Making it through a full 24 hours without a single misstep is called "reaganing." 
The only other people who have ever done it... 
Lee Iaccoca, Jack Welch, and... no judgment... 
Saddam Hussein. 
So what have you got for me? 
I need to get out to Newark airport. 
Carol's on a layover, and I really have to see him. 
You're horny, and you want to get some. 
 I get it. 
 Ew, Jack, gross. 
Come on. 
I just want to see him, and I can't get a cab, because Greece is playing Pakistan in soccer. 
Problem solved. 
I'll take you. 
Really? 
I'll drop you off at the airport, then I'll swing by MSNBC. 
I have to talk to Rachel Maddow. 
Only one of us can have this haircut. 
k-Swiss, I need to cancel my gig for hosting the MTV international video music awards. 
Why wasn't I invited to that? 
My single is number four in Japan. 
 Choke me, choke me   blonde like choke me   tee-hee-hee-hee-hee  I hate to bail, but I've been asked to do a commercial for the boys and girls club of America, and I just can't turn down community service, because if I do, that judge will make me join the coast guard. 
Well, I also recently received an unexpected honor... 
From the carvel ice cream corporation. 
They gave me this after I performed on their "Kidz 4-Eva!" float 
during last year's Thanksgiving day parade. 
 Ice cream   hey, don't you want some ice cream?  
I don't watch the Macy's parade. 
If I want to see a 50-foot spider man, I'll just go into my rec room, thank you. 
Kenneth, take this card and get a cake for the crew. 
Oh, that's very thoughtful, miss Maroney. 
Well, one of the camera guys just had a baby, and I'm sick of hearing about it. 
This will put me back on top. 
What's wrong, Lemon? 
When I see you chew your nails like that, I'd say that you're very anxious, or you've handled some ham earlier. 
When I get to the airport, I'm going to break up with Carol. 
What? 
Lemon, I am shocked. 
You two seemed so happy. 
The other day, I saw you in the lobby laughing together. 
A guy on crutches bit it in the revolving door,  and he was so scared. 
 So what's the problem? 
You ate spaghetti in front of him? 
Of course not. 
He got a fungus from your shower? 
No. 
You had a fight about something? 
No, we're not fighting. 
We don't fight. It's just... 
nothing. 
I don't want to talk about it. 
Lemon, I've known you for four years, and in that time, I've never known you to be shy about talking about anything. 
Well, I found my first gray toe-knuckle hair. 
If I could push a button and five people in the world would die, but I'd get free cable for life, I'd do it. 
And I'd been on the toilet so long that my legs had fallen asleep, so when I tried to stand, I just fell into my throw-up. 
There is one thing you don't like to talk about. 
Why aren't we moving? 
Sex, Lemon... 
Coitus, the beast with two backs. 
You and I have never had an adult conversation about boning. 
Ugh! Fine. 
Carol and I are having an intimacy problem. 
Okay, so tell me what happened. 
I was visiting Carol in Las Vegas, and there was... 
A performance issue. 
That does happen to men. 
I faced it myself with Greta van Susteren before her head transplant. 
You know, why don't I call Carol? 
No, don't do that. 
I'm "reaganing," Lemon. 
Let me solve this. 
It's not him. 
It's me. 
I'm the one with the performance problem. 
What are you talking about? 
I freaked out, and my junk closed for business. 
It's like Fort Knox down there. 
I'm just going to raise the barrier if that's okeydokey with everyone. 
It's kind of like that. 
Tracy, haven't seen you since I was directing "Garfield 3," and you ruined it. 
I had to move back in with my parents. 
I envy you. 
I don't really know my parents. 
Okay. Let me take you 
through the concept. 
It's all one shot, all right? 
We start on a boy shooting a basketball, pan to some girls double-dutching, then we pass the kid who does a flip on a trampoline, follow a skateboarder who jumps the curb and whizzes past you for your line. 
What line? 
"Boys and girls clubs of America, be great." 
We faxed the script to someone named Grizz. 
Scripts get in the way of my process, Shawn. 
Let's just shoot a hundred of these and see what we get. 
Here's your cake, miss Maroney. 
 Let's see. 
"Jenny"? 
That's not my name. 
I don't want wheelchair Jenny from accounting getting credit for my cake. 
Take it back to carvel. 
But then they'll just throw it out. 
So? 
I know food's plentiful around here, miss Maroney, but back home on our pig farm, times are tough. 
We've had to sell off Sally, Julie, and poppy. 
Are those some of your pigs? 
Yes. 
Take the cake back, Kenneth. 
You know, your little problem makes sense, Lemon. 
You have more sexual hang-ups than an adult chat line run by Gilbert Gottfried. 
What? 
That was written by a computer program we're working on to replace you. 
No, I don't have hang-ups. 
You don't think you're a bit of a prude... 
A little squeamish and conservative? 
Sex always makes things worse. 
Jack, why don't you just say you want some...? 
 Is that sex, Lemon? 
 Is the way I do it. 
We are lovers. 
Oh, that word bums me out unless it's between the words "meat" and "pizza." 
Ugh! 
She likes that? 
Okay, fine. Maybe I'm 
a little old-fashioned. 
I'm sorry I'm a real woman and not some oversexed New York nympho like those sluts on everybody loves Raymond. 
Wow. This may be 
the greatest challenge a potential "reaganer" has ever faced. 
I'm gonna fix you and save your relationship with Carol. 
I don't need to be fixed. 
 Has it happened before? 
 Yes... 
With my college boyfriend Joel Sucheki, a couple of times with Dennis, and now Carol. 
There has to be a root cause, maybe from your past. 
There isn't, Jack. 
There's got to be something. 
Go deep. 
You think I haven't thought about this? 
 There's nothing. 
 Dig. Dig down. 
Dive into the sexual abyss. 
Stop it, Jack! 
Stop it! 
Stop asking about the roller skates! 
And...Action! 
What's my cue? 
You know what? 
It doesn't matter. 
I don't know my lines. 
Cut! 
Tracy, we're causing a huge traffic jam. 
We're causing a huge traffic jam while getting paid to make dreams. 
We're the luckiest people on earth. 
Now someone get me a jolt cola! 
It does not exist anymore! 
Here's the money back from carvel, miss Maroney... 
$23.94. 
Hang on. 
She gave you cash? 
Oh, yes, I'm sorry. 
I told the girl I didn't have your card, so... 
she must have thought you meant credit card. 
How many cashiers are at that store? 
Two. 
This is fun. 
Oh, my God. 
We could run the short grift on this. 
It's been years since my mom and I used to pull slip-and-falls at supermarkets. 
I thought I was done with that life, but this is too good. 
We can pull an Arizona double-back on them, Kenneth. 
I don't understand what you're saying, but I like that it has the word "we" in it. 
I'd like to order a cake that reads, "Happy Birthday, Blenna." 
 "Blenna"? 
 Yes. 
I'm sorry, miss, but there's been a mistake with this cake, and I'm afraid I don't have the card. 
Okay, um, I'm sorry. 
Um, I'll just give you cash back. 
I need a "happy blirthday, Jennica" cake. 
Yes. 
"Bappy hirthday, Gremlin." 
Lemon, what do you want to tell me about the, uh... 
Roller skates? 
Why are we not moving? 
What is causing this traffic jam? 
I'm sorry. 
I have an erection. 
I think it's the sound of the skateboard. 
We're going again. 
Everybody safely back to one. 
Let me help you. 
I am unstoppable today. 
If it'll make it any easier, imagine you're telling your story to Reagan himself. 
Well, Liz, will you tell the gipper your sexual story? 
Mommy? 
I was nine years old. 
I was roller-skating in the house, which was absolutely forbidden. 
I was skating down the hallway on top of the world with my new skates and my new haircut, which everybody thought was a Dorothy Hamill, but was actually a Pete rose. 
Anyway, I needed to go to the bathroom, but the door was locked. 
My recently divorced aunt had moved in with us, and I was sharing a bathroom with her. 
To be prepared, I tried to take my underpants off over my roller skates. 
I slipped, and as I fell, I pulled down this poster of the singer Tom Jones that my aunt had put up. 
My mom heard the noise and ran and found me... 
Squirming under the Tom Jones poster with my underpants around my ankles. 
It didn't look good, Jack. 
She thought I did it on purpose. 
And she didn't say a word. 
She just went in my room and took all my posters... 
grizzly Adams, Larry Wilcox, Han Solo, Tug McGraw, Mike Schmidt, Kermit, Gunther Gebel-Williams. 
She took all the people away, Jack. 
Sex makes the people go away! 
I'm gonna see what's up with this traffic. 
Oh, here's your money back, ma'am. 
Boy, they sure are making a lot of mistakes over there today. 
Do you really not understand what we're doing? 
Of course I do. 
We're standing here talking, adding brick after brick to our friendship castle so it someday reaches the sky. 
With carvel, Kenneth. 
We're conning them. 
I'm ordering messed-up cakes and getting them free with my card. 
Then you're returning them for cash. 
We're selling back free cakes. 
But, miss Maroney, that's wrong and illegal. 
If cookie puss knew, he'd tear us apart with his fangs. 
Well, here's your cut. 
We're not hurting anybody. 
Carvel's got plenty of money. 
 But the... 
 Shh. 
I need a partner to pull this off and think of all the good you can do with that money back home. 
They do need help. 
And with enough money, they could buy those magic beans from that old hermit. 
We'd be rich. 
Hang on. 
Why isn't the hermit rich? 
Oh, wait. He is. 
He has a lot of friends. 
Take the money, Kenneth. 
Help your family. 
No one will ever know. 
Shirt on or off, Shawn? 
 On! 
 Good note! 
Back to one! 
Hey, Jackie d! 
Let's take a quick 500 so everybody can meet Jack! 
You know him? 
Please help me get his line. 
Fix this. 
No, I don't need any more problems to solve, especially not him. 
I am the Sisyphus of "reaganing." 
Yeah! 
That's the kind of stuff I should be saying. 
It's in my head now. 
Let's roll. 
I'm sorry, jelly beans. 
I know how much the gipper liked you, and... 
I've failed him. 
It's funny. 
I remember George Shultz telling me how later in Reagan's presidency when his mind was, uh, resting... 
How they would use jelly beans to convince people that he was... 
That's it. 
I know how to fix Tracy. 
Make him eat these. 
I'll take care of the rest. 
Boys and girls clubs of America, be great. 
Oh, my God. 
We got it! 
I'm on my way, Liz Lemon. 
Make way. 
I'm "reaganing." 
Don't you worry. 
I'm sending you some money so you can get your operation. 
Now, can you put a human on the phone? 
Hello? 
Well, Kenneth, it's over. 
I got made at carvel. 
They figured out our scam and gave me this. 
What? 
No. 
Sorry. 
It's the short grift. 
You got to walk away. 
We can't stop now. 
My family needs money. 
But they're onto us. 
I have another idea... 
For a long con. 
Kenneth, I know your intentions are good, but I don't like what this is doing to you. 
You seem meaner and stronger. 
What if you got a motorcycle, and we did it on it? 
 Are you in or not? 
 What's the angle? 
Who else was on that Thanksgiving float with you? 
One last long grift, huh? 
Okay, I'm in. 
But one rule... 
Anybody gets hurt during the score, we leave them behind to die. 
Now... 
Who are you, and what are we doing? 
That cake is worth $40. 
I'm not sure we can do that. 
Liz wrote this sketch before she left. 
Ice-cream-cake eating contest? 
Okay, we're gonna need about 20 cakes for this. 
I'll tell props. 
No, Pete. 
I'll tell props. 
Okay. 
Good afternoon. 
I would like 21 cakes that read, "Frajer reunion 2010." 
Isn't it "Frasier"? 
No, it's "Frajer." 
And I should know. 
I'm "Frajer." 
I mean, "Frajer"? 
Come on. 
I should throw some tossed salad and scrambled eggs at you. 
"Frajer." 
No. 
"Frajer"! 
We sold the cakes twice. 
You're a genius, Kenneth. 
$800 split 3 ways. 
Those ice-cream saps will rue the day they ever tangled with... 
The best friends gang. 
Lemon! 
Why did you leave? 
I'm trying to help you. 
You can't help me. 
No one can. 
Well, I'm fixing you, and I'm saving your relationship. 
I can do it. 
Look, sex is a beautiful, natural, and joyful part of our shared human experience. 
Hey, you two want to party? 
Now is not a good time, miss. 
$20 for a party, $60 to bite me during it. 
I'll do stuff with a dog, but I get to pick the dog. 
 People want that? 
 This is not helping! 
You want to watch me be with her? 
Me with you? 
Me and both of you without my leg? 
Thank you. 
Just, uh, take this and, uh, move along. 
You two are pretty uptight for hanging out under a bridge. 
Sex is horrible. 
 What is it? 
 It's 4:00, sir. 
You did it... a day of perfect 
problem solving. 
Gifts have been coming in all afternoon. 
It's 4:00? 
And you fixed me, so... 
Yay. 
Send everything back. 
 What? Why? 
 I didn't do it. 
I failed. 
 It's her, isn't it? 
 Sorry. 
I hate her, sir! 
Stupid cookie puss! 
Are you all right, miss? 
I just got fired 'cause Kelsey Grammer scammed me. 
Forget trying to go straight. 
I'm going back to working under that bridge. 
 I know. 
  Kenneth, we got a new con. 
We're gonna go down to Florida, open up a medical-supply store, then get some social security numbers. 
Through seduction. 
I'm sorry, sir-ma'am. 
 I'm out. 
 What? 
Why? 
Because miss Maroney was wrong. 
People did get hurt by our actions. 
And, yes, my family sure could use a couple hundred more dollars, but it's not right. 
A couple hundred dollars, huh? 
I think I can help you out. 
But first I'm gonna need $50 to get started. 
Kelsey, no. 
I'm proud of you, Kenneth. 
You've got a good heart. 
I hope you get into a car accident someday, so I can have it. 
Now there's only one thing left to do. 
Beat you out of the best friends gang. 
Well, it's been a pretty rough day, but at least we're in Newark now. 
What are you gonna do about Carol? 
I'm gonna break up with him, let him off the hook. 
That would be a mistake, Lemon. 
Yes, you are the sexual equivalent of a million hindenburgs, but you deserve someone like Carol in your life, and he deserves you, because... 
and I'm only gonna say this once a decade... 
you're great. 
You're Liz Lemon, damn it. 
In certain lights, you're an 8 using east coast over-35 standards, excluding Miami. 
Thanks, Jack. 
You go in there, you grab Carol, you take him into one of those unisex family bathrooms, pull down that diaper-changing thing, and go to town on him. 
I'll try, but if I couldn't get it done in Vegas after a Penn & Teller show, I don't know how it's gonna happen here. 
Wait a minute. 
You had your problem with Carol in Las Vegas? 
 So? 
 The Tom Jones poster. 
Tom Jones plays Vegas all the time. 
He has billboards everywhere. 
No kidding. 
There was one right outside our hotel-room window. 
Oh, my God. 
Think back to your college boyfriend. 
 Was there any... 
 Yes! 
When this happened with Joel, what's new pussycat? 
Was playing on the bus we were on. 
I mean, the room we were in. 
And when it happened with Dennis, he had just gotten a perm. 
Tom Jones is the trigger. 
He makes you remember your mother taking the people away. 
Does this mean I'm fixed? 
Oh, God, no. You've got years 
of therapy ahead of you, probably electroshock. 
But this is a breakthrough, Lemon, and a big one. 
Jack Donaghy, in my book, you're better than Reagan. 
I appreciate that, Lemon, but if you ever speak ill of Reagan again, I will smack those teeth straight. 
U-S-A! U-S-A! 
U-S-A! U-S-A! 
He's at JFK. 
I wrote it down wrong. 
 How is the sex? 
 Fast and only on Saturdays. 
It's perfect. 
I have been sexually rejected by not one, but two guys who later went to clown college. 
And one time at summer camp, I kissed a girl on a dare, but then she drowned. 
It was the first gay guy I ever kissed. 
Standing up? 
What? 
How does that even work? 
 You haven't had sex? 
 Shh. 
We have, of course, pleasured one another. 
No, stop. 
I believe. 
Ugh! 
Stop saying, "relationship." 
I'm sorry. 
I was going to say, "climax." 
Ah! 
Hey, what was that sound? 
It was opportunity knocking. 
No one knocked. 
You just barged in. 
 Knock knock. 
 You were right, Donald. 
It makes more sense for you to enter first. 
It's okay, daddy. 
We'll just start over. 
Uh, you know, why don't we just dive in to whatever this is? 
Okay, you remember Donald, my son who's two years older than me. 
Ah, yes, please. 
As I recall, you own the Tracy Jordan institute for black karate. 
You wouldn't believe this, but that business failed. 
I blame Obama. 
But the good news is, Donald has a brand-new venture. 
Sell him, son. 
It's a theme restaurant in Times Square. 
Well, the theme restaurant business model does work. 
Nascar's fat load cafe is a gold mine. 
Well, we got a bunch of capital from Brown and Folderson. 
And we wanted to get you a seat on this rocket before it takes off. 
So it's decided. 
Jack's on board as an investor. 
Ah, not so fast. 
So...it's...decid... 
Uh, let's just bottom-line this thing. 
I never invest without doing my research. 
I'll do a site visit tonight and kick the tires. 
All right, but if some other investor comes along, it's your loss. 
A Mexican billionaire's calling me right now. 
Excuse me. 
Senior Mexico, uh, si si. 
Yo soy Donald, si. 
Andale andale? 
Arriba arriba? 
What is senior Mexico saying? 
Stop keeping me out of the loop! 
Hey, Jenna, I need to go over... 
Gah! 
 Snuh! 
 What is it, Liz? We're busy. 
Jenna and I are mirroring until we achieve touchless orgasm. 
And...Finished. 
 Agh. 
 Well, I have to go to work. 
My new manager is making us wear nametags. 
I might as well be working at a roller-skating drag queen restaurant under Taliban rule. 
But after your shift, we still have our special night, right? 
You have no idea how special. 
Ugh. 
Oh. We're celebrating 
our six-month anniversary and I think Paul is going to pop the question. 
Really? That's a little fast, 
isn't it? 
I will say yes when Paul proposes... 
That we make a sex tape and leak it on the Internet. 
Oh, I thought you meant marriage. 
God, no. 
Marriage is like death. 
You settle into a routine. 
You lose all the spark. 
I don't know. 
I always thought the whole point of being with someone for a long time is to get to the comfortable routine part. 
No. Relationships 
are like sharks, Liz. 
If you're not left with several bite marks after intercourse, then something's wrong. 
Well, nothing's wrong with me and Carol. 
I mean, we haven't spoken in five days, but that doesn't mean anything because we are not sharks. 
We are legless turtles rotting on the beach. 
Jack, what makes a guy get bored in a dating situation? 
That's an excellent question. 
The answer is questions like that. 
Look, this long distance is hard. 
And now Carol and I haven't talked in, like, five days and my other stuff is still unresolved. 
I get it, Lemon. 
You need to see a therapist. 
Someone you can dump your problems on and then get on with your, uh, "life." 
Ugh. I'm trying. I just can't 
find someone I like. 
I mean, have you ever been to a shrink? 
No. I believe 
that when you have a problem, you talk it over with your priest, or your tailor, or the mute elevator porter at your men's club. 
Then you take that problem and crush it with your mind vice. 
But for lesser beings like curly-haired men and people who need glasses, therapy can help. 
And, Lemon, I want you to get better because... and I mean this... 
I'm tired of talking this much to a woman I'm not having sex with. 
Hey, Jack. 
Welcome to Staples. 
Why did you choose that name? 
Because staples means "the basics." 
And that's what you're getting here. 
Food, drinks, fun. Staples. 
Yeah, we got that. 
Staples is also a giant office supply chain. 
Well, we'll see who's still in business 200 years from now. 
Come on. 
Donald, I'm going to pick a problem at random. 
Is the theme of your restaurant "not enough tables"? 
No. We just need 
a lot of room for the monster fight. 
Excuse me? 
Jack, are you familiar with the megarestaurant medieval times? 
Well, I took that model and replaced the knights with unlicensed versions of Japanese monsters. 
Ladies and gentlemen, there's been an underwater nuclear explosion. 
A beast has been awakened. 
It approaches with fearsome steps. 
Boom boom boom. 
Are we paying the price for our hubris of science? 
Witness the primeval might that is godzila with one "l" for trademark reasons. 
Oh, no one is safe! 
Who all is going to protect us? 
It's mechagodzila. 
Boom boom boom. 
Thank you for choosing staples. 
Ah! Donald, 
George punched my crotch. 
You liked it. 
Oh, my God. 
Captain Burnett called earlier, miss Lemon. 
Finally. 
Not that it matters. 
We're turtles. 
He said he doesn't have cell phone service 'cause he's on layover in Daytona Beach. 
But don't worry, he's fine and having a great time with his flight crew. 
Uh, Stewart, Brenda, Amber, Crystal. 
Also in the background, I heard lady giggles and the sound of a beautiful sunset. 
See, this is why I need to find someone to talk to. 
 Talk to about what? 
 Men. Trust. 
I mean, I just feel like sometimes men aren't totally honest with me. 
Hmm. Go on. 
Well, for starters, everyone I ever dated in high school turned out to be either gay or a girl dressed as a guy to get a journalism scholarship. 
My own dad tried to secretly cheat on my mom. 
And I thought their marriage was perfect. 
Then, of course, there's Santa Claus. 
Okay. Talk about that. 
When I was seven, I asked for a CB radio for Christmas so I could track gas prices around the state for a cool chart that I was making. 
We'll get back to that later. 
When I didn't get it, my dad blamed Santa Claus. 
Well, Santa made an enemy that day. 
And the next year when he returned to the Schuylkill galleria, so did vengeance. 
Ho ho ho. What can Santa 
bring you this year? 
What does it matter? 
You didn't bring me what I asked for last year, you fat fraud. 
You're a bigger disappointment than our current president Jimmy Carter. 
I am a fraud, little boy. 
My wife still thinks I work at the bank. 
I guess Santa Claus was the first man to ever betray me. 
That must've been difficult. 
It was. 
But it feels good to talk about it. 
Thanks. 
Miss Lemon, there's a reason God gave us two ears and only one mouth. 
Listening is twice as important as talking. 
But he gave us ten fingers. 
He must really want us to poke things. 
 Oh. 
 Poke poke poke poke. 
Oh. It's the vacant lot 
where we had our first face kiss. 
Who stole my canteen? 
Jenna, what we have is so beautiful. 
People need to see how happy we make each other. 
And I think we're ready to take that step. 
So over Christmas, I want you to come to Ohio and meet my parents. 
 What? 
 Happy anniversary. 
Hey, get a room! 
Whatever that is. 
Well, Tracy, I went to the restaurant last night. 
That place is a disaster. 
Damn it, you think I don't know that? 
I've poured more cash into Donald's restaurant than my money pit in Connecticut. 
You have a house in Connecticut? 
No, I do not. 
Jack, I need other investors besides me. 
What? You're the only one 
bankrolling this? 
What about Brown and Folderson? 
That's what I call my wallet. 
I've bankrolled every one of Donald's dumb ideas. 
But what choice do I have? 
I'm his father. 
But you're doing him no favors as a business partner or a father. 
You need to cut him off. 
Come on. 
The boy's only 43 years old. 
Tracy, listen to me, not everyone is cut out to be a businessman. 
For example, curly-haired men and people who need glasses. 
But I can't crush his dreams. 
You're not. 
You're just letting him fly with his own wings. 
I bankrolled that too. 
Thank God we tested it with a monkey first. 
Oh, miss Lemon, I'm signing people up for the TGS softball team. 
So far I have eight nos and 25 shove it up your goon-holes. 
 Shove it up your goonhole. 
 Okay. 
You know, ever since we had our little talk yesterday, I've been doing some thinking. 
Oh, good. 
If I remember correctly, we were discussing men and trust. 
Yeah. And it got me thinking 
about my aunt Linda. 
 What was she like? 
 Great until she got divorced. 
My Uncle Harry was cheating on her. 
Another male betrayal. 
Go with that. 
My parents used to make me go to Linda's house just so she'd have company. 
I hated those visits. 
Your uncle never liked my cooking. 
But you do, right, Elizabeth? 
You love your aunt Linda. 
Here's a fun game: Put on Harry's cologne and give me a backrub in the bath. 
To this day, whenever I hear someone's getting divorced, I can still taste that egg and I... 
Oh, my God. 
My trust issues and my food issues are connected. 
Uncle Harold is the reason eggs make me gag. 
Kenneth, you're the perfect therapist. 
I can dump all of my problems on you, walk away, and move on with my life. 
It's a win-win. 
Why did she have to say "Harold"? 
Liz. 
Last night was a disaster. 
And not the good kind where I get to sing at a benefit. 
What happened? 
Paul's idea of moving things forward is me meeting his parents. 
He said they live in a "soo-borb." 
Suburb. Come on, Jenna. 
It's not what you wanted, but it's progress. 
In the wrong direction. 
I think I know what's really going on between you and Paul. 
You're in love and it's terrifying to you. 
You're trying to sabotage it. 
Sabotage? 
I'm the one trying to make this relationship work. 
Which is why I'm gonna have to be the one to propose the sex tape. 
Call me old-fashioned, but I think that's the man's job. 
Jack, I found a therapist and I've made some big breakthroughs. 
I know you don't know what this means, but I'm eating eggs again. 
I know it means this conversation is disgusting. 
Okay, Donald is on his way up. 
I know cutting him off is hard, but it's your duty as a parent... 
Tracy, do not laugh at the word "duty." 
Be strong. Be rational. 
 No emotion. 
 Unemotional. Got it. 
 Daddy, what's going on? 
 I just love you so much! 
I love you too, daddy. 
Okay, stop it. 
Donald, what Tracy is trying to tell you is that you're an adult and he will no longer support you financially. 
Is that true, daddy? 
For the love of God, stop calling him "daddy." 
It is true, little man. 
But I need you to be a big boy on this. 
You're just not meant to be a businessman. 
Fine. I'll be okay. 
I got other ideas. 
Like a microbrewery that also serves frozen yogurt. 
I'm gonna call it "Microsoft." 
I have this recurring dream. 
Actually, is it recurring if you wake yourself up with a  and then return to it? 
Anyway, in the dream, I'm a baby. 
I think it has to do with my issues with sex. 
Lemon, what are you doing? 
Is Kenneth your therapist? 
 Well, kind of. 
 He can't handle that. 
Look at his head shape. 
He has no brain pan! 
It's fine, Mr. Donaghy. 
I'm okay. 
And so am I. I'm Cheryl. 
This is exactly why I told you to see a professional. 
You dump your problems on some half-baked Barney fife and you can start a chain reaction of mental anguish. 
Look what you've done to him. 
But he's such a good listener and he takes my insurance. 
I'm going to help you. 
Lie down. 
Put your mental burden in my mind vice and I will crush it. 
Kenneth, who is Harold? 
He...Was a role model 
of mine growing up. 
Please let Harold be human. 
Harold was a pig. 
You see, my father passed when I was just a young boy. 
After that, I was alone a lot and awful sad. 
But that pig saved me. 
In some ways, Harold was the only thing I had that was like a father. 
You had a void to fill. 
Continue. 
Then one day, my mama told me we had to sell him. 
I knew what that meant. 
Harold was off to the slaughterhouse. 
 I know it's difficult... 
 I'm not done, sir. 
It gets worse. 
With Harold gone, there was nothing keeping me at home. 
It was time for me to move to New York and follow my dreams. 
But I needed $300 for the river ferry train-ox cart-train-bus ticket. 
And that's when I saw the sign. 
I knew I could win that contest. 
Heck, I'd once eaten an entire witch. 
A pig was nothing. 
And then they brought me mine. 
I would have recognized those eyes anywhere. 
 Kenneth, no. 
 It was Harold. 
And I ate all of him. 
Even the face in case of a tie. 
 Good God! 
 I ate him, sir! 
I ate my father pig! 
Okay! Or you gave 
his death meaning. 
His sacrifice made you what you are today, which is the lowest-level employee at the last-place network in America. 
I guess that is true. 
Thank you, sir. 
I'll think on that. 
And you're sure you're okay hearing about all my problems? 
Of course, I'm Jack Donaghy. 
Oh, no. Crush it. 
Oh, God, here comes my childhood! 
I'm in here, Paul! 
The restaurant was crazy today. 
During nude hour, I got custard all over my penis. 
What's going on in here? 
You want to take this to the next level? 
Let's videotape our lovemaking, pretend the tape got stolen, and let the whole world see. 
Wow. 
I don't know, Jenna. 
 I'm pretty beat. 
 I see. 
Fine. I guess we're just done 
having any adventure or excitement in our lives. 
God. Well, jeez, I'm sorry 
that I'm happy with the way things are. 
Come on, why can't we just paint each other's toenails, watch vintage pornography, and then go to bed in our swing like a normal couple? 
Because it's boring. 
We might as well be married... 
Okay, this isn't about us being adventurous. 
This is about you being afraid to settle down with me. 
 That's not true. 
 Fine. Let's do this tape. 
But then what? 
What will you want next? 
Well, there's a sex resort in Japan where white people are treated like slaves. 
No, Jenna! 
You're making it impossible to live up to your expectations. 
What are you saying? 
I'm saying adopting a dog so it can watch us make love and then returning it claiming that it bit our imaginary child is everything that I need. 
But if that's really not enough for you, tell me now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Very well. 
I'm not going to beg you. 
I have my dignity. 
I trust you to fairly divide up our panties. 
I'll come get them tomorrow while you're at work. 
Oh, miss Lemon, I have another message from Captain Burnett. 
Please don't get sad, and remember things, and infect me again. 
Kenneth, it's okay. 
I'm not worried about Carol anymore. 
I'm just sorry I messed you up like that. 
Don't worry. I had my brain 
cleaned by Mr. Donaghy. 
Oh, I told him everything. 
How Harold was... 
No, no! 
Don't tell me your story! 
I can't handle it. 
Look how small my head is. 
Oh, my! So tiny. 
Daddy, I wanted to give you your share of our profits before I shut down my dream. 
Someone left it in coat check. 
Tracy, listen to me. 
I was wrong. 
Don't turn your back on Donald. 
Too late. 
Look how we're positioned. 
Kenneth told me a story earlier... 
a story about fathers and sons. 
And despite my best effort, it unearthed a memory from my own childhood. 
As a boy, I wanted to be an astronaut, or a deep-sea diver, a man of science. 
But I was raised by Jimmy Donaghy, a man who projected his own failed dreams on to his family. 
When I was in third grade, my class put on a science play. 
The night before, Jimmy came home drunk and found me rehearsing my lines. 
I was struggling with the science terms. 
And Jimmy laughed and said "well, looky here. 
"Dr. Jack. The boy wants 
to be a scientist. 
"Chowderhead can't even say the words! 
You'll never be nothing!" 
The next day, I was up on that stage. 
I looked out at the audience, I saw Jimmy, and I froze. 
I am a protoin. 
Protein! 
All living orgasms... 
I mean orgasms. 
Chowderhead can't even say the words. 
When I got home, I threw away my microscope, my shell collection, my map of the stars. 
 Nerd. 
A parent is the one person who is supposed to make their kid think they can do anything. 
Says they're beautiful even when they're ugly. 
Thinks they're smart even when they go to Arizona state. 
Let the rest of the world tear your kid down. 
Your job is to support him no matter what. 
Tracy believes you, Donald. 
Go and make him proud. 
That's a nice, long speech and all, but your daddy was right. 
You couldn't be a scientist. 
You could even be protein in a school play. 
And I can't run a business. 
I'm a failure. 
I... 
Am a protein! 
All living organisms need me to function. 
A basic building block of the human body. 
I'm made from amino acids found in ribosomes. 
Proteins give energy to everything from flowers and butterflies to heroes who turn in communists. 
I am a protein. 
Daddy, can I have $50,000 to start a business where people can call in and get air quality reports from all across the United States? 
 I'm gonna call it... 
 Donald, no. 
 American airlines. 
 And it's going to work, son! 
This is what happens when you work at being happy. 
Godzilla sits next to you while you're eating an egg salad sandwich. 
 What a world. 
 What's the point? 
I moved here to make it to Broadway. 
Now look at me. 
I'm pathetic. 
I've got no real skills. 
A degree in theater tech. 
So you move back to Pennsylvania. 
Live with your parents. 
All of your old friends have kids and careers. 
And what do you have? 
Maybe your name on a TV show that no one will even remember. 
I should've moved to Cleveland with that guy when I had the chance. 
Damn you, Gojira! 
Previously, on "Queen of Jordan..." 
Don't tell me I can't sing. 
What the  have you ever done? 
Who the  are the Beatles? 
I know what you said about me. 
Please. I don't even think 
about you. 
You're nothing. 
I know the photo shoot for Randi's dog's funeral is the wrong place to tell you this, but I'm going to Africa. 
It's my way till payday. 
D'Fwan, glue in the business weave. 
I have an important meeting with Jack Donaghy from NBC today. 
D'Fwan forgot his catchphrase. 
Since Tracy is off helping people in Africa, I finally have a chance to focus on me. 
That is why I'm launching my music career. 
It has been my dream to be a singer ever since I was a little... 
drunk the other day and rented out a recording space. 
Oh, Angie, thank you for coming in. 
NBC could not be happier... 
About Queen of Jordan. 
For the first time in six months, we beat all the music choice channels except, of course, Latin Beats. 
Well, Angie's thinking of the next move now. 
As you know, my single "My Single is Dropping"  is dropping. 
 What's happening? 
My single is called "My Single is Dropping" and it's dropping. 
Angie, "My Single is Dropping" is the reason I wanted the three of us to meet. 
With Tracy gone, TGS will be airing another "Best of" Special. 
Actually, legal says we can't use the word "best." 
Either way, the studio is free, so I thought we would have your release party there. 
You would perform and Lemon here will help you put it together. 
What? No. I thought 
we were here to talk about getting Tracy back from Africa. 
Look, I love Tracy. 
But he is work. 
Angie, look what the banister did to me! 
Do know how much of my time he wastes? 
 Let's role play. 
 Tracy, we're gonna be late! 
Our boat exploded. 
With Tracy away, it's time to let Angie be the star. 
I hope Tracy doesn't come home for months. 
Months? No. We can't make it 
that long without Tracy. 
 You can't do this! 
 Are you giving me orders? 
Am I the waiter? 
Is this the restaurant that I'm opening up with Dennis Rodman and Webster? 
No. I just thought 
you would be on my side. 
"Yes, we can." 
Obama '08, remember? 
Look, this is a very complic... 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
As an executive of Kabletown and NBC Universal I am ordering you not to use that footage. 
John Francis Donaghy. 
Verbal signature. 
Angie's single release party is tomorrow night. 
It seems like the perfect place for me to reveal my shocking, secret past. 
No, we're not writing a tearful admission about you being a call girl in Delaware. 
Write it yourself. 
For your information, I am a Christian illiterate, so that's not an option. 
You know what, I'm not getting sucked into your crazy reality show nonsense. 
Liz, I'm so mad at you for that thing you did. 
Am I trying to instigate fights by throwing wine at people just to get on camera and maybe also promote my new lifestyle web site: Jennas-side.com? 
Of course not. 
I mean, is wine throwing something that even gets you on a reality show? 
God, Jenna, I told you not to buy that domain name. 
 Say it out loud. 
 Jennasside... Genocide. 
I'm not hearing it, Liz. 
Hey, guess who's getting out of jail. 
I don't know. But I hope 
they didn't collect $200. 
Lynn Onkman. 
Remember her? 
Oh, sure, that hot teacher from Queens who had an affair with her student. 
Oh, my God. 
Check out this picture. 
Frank, is that you? 
You never said you were in Lynn Onkman's class. 
 Sure, I did. 
 What? 
Do you know the kid she had an affair with? 
No. Yes. I don't know. 
Shut up. 
 It was you. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
Well done, sir. 
Guys, a teacher preying on a student is wrong... 
Yeah. 
If the teacher is male and the student is female. 
What happened to Frank is awesome. 
 Standing ovation. 
 You don't understand! 
It was love! 
We were in love! 
I need to look good for my party. 
And I refuse to wear anything in my size or appropriate for my age. 
Lemon, a word. 
Ham. 
Wow. 
If only Tracy were here, he'd be, like, "Damn, woman, "I want to make love to your neck." 
Don't do impressions of other races. 
Roger that, Angie. 
 I'm in charge of setting up for Angie's party. 
'Cause I'm not just a gay hairdresser. 
I'm also a homosexual party planner. 
Mr. D'Fwan, 
Party City does not sell giant see-through clocks or strap-on Pegasus wings, so I got this paper pineapple instead. 
Hey, girlfriends. 
Why don't we all have some drinks and talk about how I think Portia has no class. 
 Yeah, you heard me, Portia. 
 Uhuh. 
I will not be in the same room as that woman. 
Is this about what happened in Atlantic city? 
 I didn't say it. 
 You did. 
 You did. 
 I didn't say it. 
 I didn't say it! 
 You did! 
 I didn't say it. 
 You did. 
Excuse me. I'm looking 
for Francis Rossitano. 
Oh, snap. 
That's Lynn Onkman. 
Portia reads the papers. 
 Mrs. Onkman? 
 Frank R? 
Yeah. 
Michael. 
Are you back on meth? 
 Mmhmm. 
No. Why? You got some? 
Think fast. 
Nice catch, dotcom. 
I'm sick of being disrespected by that man. 
Sick of it. 
Yeah. I was an athlete. 
Very graceful. 
Sports stories? 
I got some. 
Uh, I'm meeting my friend Greg for lunch. 
Again? 
When I was at Princeton, I played baseball and football. 
And back then, football players went both ways. 
Really? 
So you went both ways? 
Yeah. We all did. 
It was the '70s. 
So when you played baseball, were you ever on the DL? 
Yeah. I was on the DL 
most of my junior year. 
Mm. 
DL can mean "disabled list." 
But it can also mean "down low" or "secretly gay." 
Which one was Jack talking about? 
When we were on the DL, we spent most of our time in the whirlpool getting rubbed down. 
You were a switch-hitter? 
Switch-hitter. 
Pitcher. Catcher. 
Whatever the boys needed. 
I think I made my point. 
I drank all the throwing wine and I have something to say to Portia. 
I know what you said about me. 
Good. Because I'm concerned 
about you. 
Even though we just met, I can tell you're an alcoholic. 
Come on, Portia. 
I want to fight. 
I have battled my own demons and you need help. 
No. I don't need 
any help. 
I am in denial about my disease. 
And I don't know what would change that. 
Drunk actor brainstorm. 
I'm going to make Pete host an intervention for me. 
It'll be all about Jenna. 
Drama. Crying. 
The beauty of redemption. 
Perhaps a song. 
This is the best day of my life. 
I'm sorry. 
You want me to perform in this? 
Yeah. You're Amy Grant 
from the "Baby Baby" video. 
The one where the man likes her at the Carnival. 
That's some white nonsense. 
Too bad Tracy's not here to take your side. 
He'd be, like, "Damn you, Liz Lemon." 
We discussed this, Elizabeth. 
Yes. Uh, anyway, 
I've got the auditions for your backup dancers. 
Good. 'Cause I'm looking 
for dancers who can dance for 15 seconds 'cause that's how long my song is. 
What? 
That's my wedding video. 
Oh, no. I must've mixed up 
the DVD discs. 
Agh! Well, we'll just have 
to watch it anyway  and see what feelings arise. 
 Angie, just start! 
Are you wearing handcuffs, Tracy? 
Can my friend cheese come with us on our honeymoon? 
What? 
Okay, I should've watched that first. 
Do you see how exhausting that man can be? 
Yes. He has his flaws. 
But I know you two love each other. 
Yeah. And with him gone, 
our relationship has never been better. 
So he can stay in Africa for as long as he wants. 
I'm on Angie time now. 
Frank and Lynn's story really moved me. 
So I let them have their reunion date at the Stripaerobics Studio I bought with the money I got after that cop shot me. 
What else did you miss in prison? 
Oh, they kept remaking The Hulk and it kept getting worse. 
 Could we talk about something other than comic book movies? 
Sure. 
Yeah, uh... 
I thought about you a lot while I was away. 
And I still remember the... the moment 
when we fell in love. 
You were administering a scoliosis test to the class and you lingered on my spine. 
Frank, why did you bring me here? 
And who's that woman? 
A friend. Continue. 
I'm sorry, but I couldn't bring you to my place. 
My mom's there and she still wants you to rot in hell. 
You live with your mother? 
Yeah. Otherwise who would 
wake me up for work? 
 What's wrong? 
 - Oh, Frank. 
The boy I fell in love with was the most amazing eighth-grader that I've ever met. 
And I couldn't wait to meet the man that that boy became, but you haven't grown. 
You're still talking about superheroes and video games and why Seth Logan shouldn't have played the green something. 
Hornet. Yeah. 
And it's Rogen. 
It's like you're stuck. 
Oh. 
I wonder why I'm stuck. 
What could've happened to me when I was 14 to make me never want to grow up? 
Inside voice, Frank. 
And I refuse to take the blame for that. 
I lost everything to be with you. 
Well, this is who I am. 
If you don't like it then what's the point? 
Now may I be dismissed? 
Okay. 
I thought this was a meeting to discuss your spinoff where you do matchmaking for wealthy dogs. 
I lied. 
D'Fwan thinks that maybe you're not being true to your you. 
I know what it's like to live a lie. 
I used to be in the military. 
But I was unfairly thrown out because I went berserk around all those dudes and tried to bang everybody. 
It has come to my attention that some of what I said yesterday may have been misconstrued. 
"Going both ways" in football means playing offense and defense. 
And there is nothing gay about the Princeton fight song. 
 Oh, the merry men of Princeton are charging up the rear   holding all the balls...  
okay, I hear it now. 
Regardless, I'm not gay or clumsy. 
So your little show has nothing with which to embarrass me. 
That was the chair. 
Here. I'll show you. 
It was the chair. 
What is this? 
Jenna, everyone here loves you very much. 
But because of your drinking, we feel like we're losing you. 
Is this an intervention? 
We all agree it's gone too far. 
Kenneth. Richard Esposito. 
Your two psychics. 
Wait. You're seeing 
another psychic? 
I mean, I knew that. 
No! I am not doing this! 
I'm leaving! 
Read your letters. 
Jenna, everyone has written you letters that they'd like to share. 
"Miss Maroney, your addiction has negatively affected me "in the following ways. 
"Number one, I was so worried, I forgot to write the rest of this letter." 
Thank you. 
I mean... 
Webster, we need to talk. 
Your check didn't clear. 
, , , , . 
'Scuse me. 
Is that my computer? 
No, I was just... 
no, pinwheel. Not now. 
Are you on my email? 
Are you emailing my husband? 
I can explain. 
I'm asleep right now and I think that that's my computer. 
Gah. Huh? Whuh? 
Where am I? 
"Tracy, as your wife, I'm ordering you to come home." 
 I know this looks bad. 
 "The kids need you. 
"And I want to give you all the sex things you like." 
You don't have to read any more. 
"For instance, doing it across the bed "instead of up and down." 
 Saw that in a movie. 
 "Come home now. 
"Sho 'nuff, Angie." 
Sho 'nuff? 
It's a first draft. 
Are you trying to trick Tracy into coming home? 
Were you trying to trick me with my wedding video? 
Listen, you're not in charge. 
I am. 
 Mind your own business. 
 Yeah, well, Tracy is my... ow. 
There's more where this came from. 
I'm contractually obligated to pull out some bitch's weave eight more times this season. 
It's not a weave. Gah. 
 It's the beauty by of redemption  Jenna, will you accept the help we're offering you today? 
Of course. 
Today is the first day of the rest of my life. 
Jenna, this is Charles. 
He has his van waiting outside. 
How nice. 
He's gonna take you to the airport and then fly with you to the Alternatives Treatment Center in Minnesota. 
Well, of course, 'cause that's how interventions end. 
And I can't back out now otherwise they can't use any of this. 
Oh, God. 
Anyway, that's why I did it. 
One, To see the fear in her eyes. 
And two, Without Tracy or Jenna, we can file a claim against the show's insurance and keep getting paid without working. 
So this is kind of the best day of my life. 
After my second husband shot me the second time, I realized that love is the most important thing in the world. 
I just hope Frank does the right thing. 
 Oh, Frank. 
How did you know where I work? 
It's one of the benefits of being in love with a registered sex offender. 
Frank, about what happened at Randi's Strippercise Studio... 
No. You were right. 
I have been afraid to grow up. 
Well, what are you doing? 
I'm throwing out my kid stuff. 
I want to become the man you waited for. 
The man you helped cheat on the presidential physical fitness test. 
Well, if you didn't get better at the shuttle run, they were gonna put you in the hospital. 
Oh, no. That's your favorite. 
You can't. 
Skeletor's not my favorite. 
You are. 
Are you throwing toys in the fryer? 
You're fired, Onkman. 
Now give me a waiver to sign. 
The world has to be educated about blurry face syndrome. 
Angie's changed her hairstyle since this last photo was taken and D'Fwan is a queer-fectionist. 
Wow. 
She gets a whole window? 
Wait. 
What used to be there? 
Oh, Angie, a Queen of Jordan indeed. 
 Muah. 
 Nnn. 
Jack, I also suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome. 
It was the chair. Oh. 
I hope you're not this clumsy on the dance floor. 
 I am not clumsy. 
 You know why you're so tense? 
It's 'cause you have a secret locked up inside you. 
A man-sex secret. 
You know what, I give up. 
If this idiotic show insists on portraying me as some clumsy, gay flatulent, so be it. 
I am extremely secure in my athleticism, my masculinity, and my rectal integrity. 
 Mmhmm. 
 "Mmhmm," indeed, D'Fwan. 
I know who I am. 
So if you want to dance, it would be my pleasure. 
Yeah, he's straight. 
That boy cannot dance. 
I know what D'Fwan said about me and it is on. 
I'm a superb dancer. 
At Princeton, I played Maria in an all-male production of West Side Story. 
Oh, forget it. You people should 
be ashamed of yourselves. 
Ah. 
Jenna, what are you doing here? 
You're supposed to be on a plane. 
I explained to Charles that I was just pretending to be an alcoholic to get on camera. 
And we laughed. 
And he said I can drink as much as I want. 
So cheers to good friends. 
You... you're insane! 
In the lobby, she pulled a wrench out of her purse, hit me over the head. 
I will never go to Minnesota. 
"My Single is Dropping" is not just about a single dropping. 
It's about a woman learning to fly. 
A woman who doesn't need a man or anybody except Josh at Sidney Bernstein Management, Sidney at Josh Bernstein Accounting. 
Shut up, Angie. 
Just shut up! 
I'm sick of your selfishness. 
People's jobs are at sake. 
I'm selfish? 
You are a joke. 
And everybody thinks so. 
Let me talk. 
I am talking. 
Will you let me talk? 
Can I talk for once? 
You need to call Tracy right now because I know that he is your man, but he is my man too. 
And TGS is my family. 
And my family is thick as thieves. 
Now who here wants to teach me how to fight? 
Attention everyone. 
I found a glove in the elevator. 
If anyone is missing a glove, I may have found your glove. 
Angie, I'm so sorry. 
I didn't mean to make you cry. 
No. It's not you, 
Liz Lemon. It's them. 
I miss my weird love, but he won't come back. 
What? 
I've been trying to get Tracy to come back ever since he left, but he won't. 
So I sit and act like this is what I want. 
But what I really want is for everything to go back to the way it used to be. 
I just want to wake up in the morning and look over at my husband asleep... 
On our neighbor's roof. 
But if you can't get him to come back, who can? 
What if he never comes back? 
What is going to happen to all of us? 
Wait. You know what, 
this is my glove. 
If anyone sees another glove, I've lost one of my gloves. 
Thank you. 
Next week on "Queen of Jordan..." 
I challenge you to a  dance contest! 
You'll never get me Charles. 
 Why are you mad at me?? 
 Because the way you **** I never said it. 
That was the chair, because I only pass gas once a year for an hour **** ****** Oh, God!! 
Oh brother! 
﻿1 I know I'm jumping the gun a bit, but I had this made for the baby at hermes. 
So she can ride the maid! 
It is adorable. 
Uh, but are we still in love with the name "Charlotte"? 
I think so. 
Why do you ask? 
Charlotte? 
Are you serious? 
Lemon went to middle school with a Charlotte who used to rub herself against a tree during recess. 
I want to know why you would tell Lemon something so personal. 
I know that my relationship with Lemon may seem strange, but I am her mentor. 
And the Donaghy mentoring experience is immersive. 
There need to be boundaries. 
That woman is your employee. 
No, she's more than that. 
I don't choose my mentees lightly. 
They have to have the drive and ambition to be worth my time, the intelligence to understand the challenges they're going to face, the humility to accept my help, and finally, a life that is a bottomless swamp of chaos. 
Drive, intelligence, humility, chaos... 
or the acronym "dihc." 
I'm looking for dihc, Avery. 
And I'm gonna take it wherever I can find it. 
It's been four years, Jack. 
Maybe it's time for Liz to graduate. 
Maybe it's time for you to carry this baby. 
Maybe you and Liz can raise it. 
Oh, no. 
Crazy hormone swing. 
Why does everything smell like onions? 
Lemon. 
Boundaries. 
Got it. 
In here, you can see one of NBC's editing bays. 
Tracy Jordan, the star of YGS and numerous films, has died. 
No! 
No, it can't be! 
I'm not done with him, Jacob! 
He stays on this side! 
Kenneth, Tracy's not dead. 
Nbc news makes obituaries for celebrities to have them ready. 
They're just updating Tracy's to include his recent submarine d.U.I. 
Oh, thank goodness. 
Say, do you think I could get a copy of that to show Mr. Jordan? 
That way, he can see his own funeral, just like Tom Sawyer! 
Well, Tom was a fellow from my town we accidentally buried alive. 
Funny story, after we dug him back up, he tried to kill all of us. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Liz. 
It's your father. 
Dick Lemon. 
Dad, you don't have to say your name every time. 
Telephone etiquette is important, Liz. 
It lets people know your race even when they can't see you. 
Anyway, got a busy week? 
Not really, I was gonna take this class called "cooking for one," but the teacher killed himself. 
Well, what about a visit? 
Really? 
That would be great. 
With you and mom here, the doormen will have to eat their words about me never having friends over. 
Well, it'll just be me this time, Elizabeth. 
Your mother isn't coming. 
What? You and mom 
always travel together. 
Well, she's not coming this time. 
I just want to have a little fun by myself. 
Can't a guy have a little fun? 
 What is wrong with you? 
 What's wrong with you? 
Your mother's home. 
This conversation never happened. 
What? What? 
I am a Jedi! 
Tracy Jordan, star of the fat bitch movies, was also voted "worst representation of a black man" nine years in a row. 
Perhaps best known for his fcc fines... 
And thank God I didn't  anybody, and thank God I  my . 
And giving the queen parvo. 
This is terrible! 
When I'm dead, that's what I leave behind? 
That's how my grandkids will remember me as they fly around in their jetpacks? 
Well, it's not fair out of context. 
Her highness was sending signals. 
It doesn't matter. 
That's how the world sees me... 
as some idiot millionaire. 
Who, mark Cuban? 
That guy ran me over with a jet ski. 
What is he so upset about? 
It's my fault. 
I let Mr. Jordan 
see his obituary. 
He's dying? 
Fine, I'll sing at his funeral. 
No, ma'am. 
Nbc news makes celebrity obituaries ahead of time. 
Typical liberal media. 
They do? 
Well, then I need to see mine. 
If they used any of the footage from my shoplifting arrest, that would be great because my arms looked fantastic. 
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? 
My dad just called, and... 
Lemon, uh, I'm sorry. 
If this is about a personal matter, we can't discuss it. 
 What? Why? 
 It's Avery. 
She's going to be my wife someday, and understandably, the nature of our relationship is a little confusing to her. 
Oh, she feels threatened. 
It must be my "sesuality," because I am so very "sesual." 
You like that? 
And maybe Avery is a little emotional these days. 
She's put on considerable boob weight. 
She's not used to that, and sometimes she just falls over. 
It's stressful. 
But she might have a point about us. 
Maybe it isn't appropriate for you to still come to me with every little problem in your life. 
Oh. Okay. 
Great. Fine. 
I'll solve my own problems. 
Blammo. Solved it. 
What do you mean, I don't have an obituary? 
I'm Jenna Maroney. 
I played arts and literature in the film adaptation of trivial pursuit. 
I know who you are, miss Maroney, but you're not on the list. 
They only make obits for people they think are, you know, important. 
Like who? 
Kim Jong-il? 
I never heard of her. 
I should be on here. 
You wanted to see me, sir? 
Jonathan, I may be in the market for a new young person to mentor. 
Oh, my God. 
Sir, I have dreamed of this moment... 
but my fear is that you don't have enough ambition. 
The drive to deserve my mentorship. 
No, sir, there is nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you. 
My attorney is waiting in his office. 
He will present you with a contract to be my mentee if you bring him... 
My pinky. 
No, sir. 
Then you wouldn't be perfect anymore. 
 I won't do it. 
 Exactly. 
I knew that you wouldn't. 
No, no, watch! 
I'll cut off my pinky and tell him it's yours. 
Jonathan. 
Ambition is the willingness to kill the things you love and eat them in order to stay alive. 
Haven't you ever read my throw pillow? 
 Dad. 
 Hi, sweetheart! 
Mwah! 
Where are your glasses? 
And what's with that shirt? 
I don't need my glasses, and this is an Edward Hardy shirt. 
A very hip Latino-sounding blur at Mervyn's said I looked good in it. 
Dad, what are you doing? 
You're traveling alone, you show up here looking like you've been on spring break for 300 years, and earlier, mom called and told me to give you a hug before your colonoscopy. 
 Uhoh. 
Dad, look at me. 
What is going on? 
Honey, there's no easy way to say it. 
Your mother and I are taking a little break. 
A break? 
After 45 years? 
Honey, it's complicated. 
We're having problems. 
Really, does mom know you're having problems? 
'Cause she thinks you're at the doctor. 
Your mother and I don't laugh like we used to. 
I don't know what happened. 
Where has my best friend gone? 
Ugh! 
What are you talking about? 
You're just pretending like there's some big problem so you can come up here and, what, try to pick up women? 
You think they won't notice that you're 80 because you took your glasses off? 
I will not be spoken to this way, young lady. 
You know what, you're not staying here during your little time-out. 
Your "gentleman's intermission." 
Go to a hotel. 
Or better yet, go home to mom. 
Fine. 
I don't need you. 
I'm meeting up with my old army buddy Gary. 
Tonight, we're doing a push-up, and tomorrow, we're going to a bar called "Swingles." 
Gary's wife just died a couple of days ago, and he hasn't returned the hospital bed yet, so I can sleep there! 
Now, where's the door? 
I'm not telling! 
Cold. 
Colder. 
It's... 
ha ha! 
Hello? 
Hey, girl! 
What do you want, Liz? 
Look, I know I shouldn't be calling, but my dad is in town, taking a break from being married. 
It's a gentleman's intermission. 
And you want to talk about this with your boss? 
Well, when you put it like that... 
with the mean voice and all... 
good night, Liz. 
What's wrong, tray? 
Why are you sitting in your sadness spotlight? 
I seen my nbc news obituary, Jackie d. 
I look like a fool in it. 
Well, certainly you can't be surprised that there's a lot of negative stuff about you out there. 
Don't you ever Google yourself? 
Sure, I Google myself all the time. 
Like when Angie's not in the mood, or I'm alone in the hotel. 
Uh, Tracy, you do know that googling yourself means looking yourself up on the Internet. 
I did not know that. 
That explains why Liz Lemon was so cool the other day. 
Liz Lemon, you mind if I Google myself in your office? 
 Sure, Tracy. 
 Can I use your computer? 
How else are you gonna do it? 
Tracy, you are someone with a lot of problems, who needs constant guidance. 
And don't forget, I never listen. 
If you're open to it, I'm very good at giving advice. 
For example, with your obit problem. 
Now, you've spent years creating a certain public image. 
But you can change that. 
You just have to do what prince hal did. 
Who's prince hal? 
From Henry iv. 
You played him in central park last summer. 
I don't know any of my lines! 
Everyone thought prince hal was a drunken wastrel. 
But when he became king, he transformed himself into a wise and just ruler. 
He changed the headline. 
That's what you have to do, Tracy. 
You know something, Jackie d.? 
That thing I said earlier about prince hal got me thinking. 
I have to change my headline. 
Yes, that's what I just said. 
Now, if I can help you... 
No, no, no, Jackie D. 
I don't need your help. 
I'm Tracy Jordan. 
When I go to sleep, nothing happens in the world. 
He failed the test of humility. 
I cannot be his mentor. 
Well, I'd love for you to be my mentor, sir. 
But unfortunately, I already have one. 
Stop calling me! 
Okay, what would Jack tell me to do? 
First, he would probably explain that evolution makes men promiscuous, even when they're 80, like my pathetic dad. 
Is your dad pathetic, or is he maybe, on some level, admirable? 
Maybe his sons would respect him more as a man. 
Maybe they'd stop calling him a "bald wang" in front of the babysitter. 
I mean, can you imagine Dick Lemon at a singles bar? 
It makes me want to barf. 
Ugh, those old men that hit on you at clubs are so lame. 
Lame? 
Or... or is it heroic? 
Why can't they see how idiotic they look? 
With guys like that, I always just say, "who's younger... 
me or your daughter?" 
That usually creeps them out enough that they leave. 
That wouldn't work on me. 
Jack. 
Why does Tracy have a news obit and I don't? 
Huh. 
I never thought of you for the Donaghy mentoring experience, but you are an unceasing onslaught of dysfunction. 
Dr. Drew called me 
"unfixab." 
Let's think this through. 
You don't haven obit because you haven't done as much as Tracy has. 
His movies gross millions, his comedy albums go platinum, and he owns the world's only giraffe basketball team, the New York necks. 
 So your problem... 
 My problem? 
Nbc news has the problem. 
No, I don't think that's right. 
And you know what I'm going to do? 
I'm gonna make my own obituary, and show them how wrong they are. 
Then I'm afraid you're on your own, Jenna. 
You have failed the test of intelligence. 
Oh, really? 
Well, so are you! 
 Hello, Lemon. 
 Hey, Jack. 
How's business things? 
I made several overseas phone calls today. 
Well, I'm doing great. 
Like the song, I am taking on my business. 
Uh, no, it's, uh... 
right. 
Forget it. 
Shoulders back, Lemon. 
You're not welcoming people to castle frankenstein. 
I can't read any of this, Gary, can you? 
Uh, give us this third thing. 
Uh... 
Hello, miss. 
My name is Ricky. 
I'm... 
Dorothy Michaels. 
And you don't look stupid in that shirt at all. 
What do you gentlemen do? 
We work for the FBI. 
Mm-hmm, female body inspectors. 
Tell me, was your father a donkey herder? 
 Because that ass is... 
 No, no! 
My father worked at Philadelphia power and light. 
It's me, your daughter. 
Elizabeth Lemon. 
Elizabeth, what are you doing? 
Ugh, this woman's trying to hit on her own father! 
No, no! 
Good people of Swingles, hear me out. 
My married, 80-year-old father is taking a gentleman's intermission. 
That's a great name for what I'm doing. 
Just what are you trying to accomplish with this stunt, young lady? 
I am trying to show you how disgusting you are. 
No, you're the disgusting one. 
Yeah, that was a terrible plan. 
Come on, Gary. 
Let's go hit that bar with the cool rainbow flags. 
 A twotime cable ace award nominee, and three-time Tony...Shaloub sex partner, 
Jenna Maroney is perhaps best remembered for being beautiful. 
Jenna Maroney, dead at 32. 
 Jenna, you ripped through our lives   like the passin of the wind  read back what we have so far. 
"Ideas to change Mr. Jordan's headline." 
Then you said, "read back what we have so far." 
Why is this so hard? 
All I want to do is turn into a worldwide hero overnight. 
Coming up in our next half hour, we're gonna meet a heroic cat who saved its owner's life by dialing 911. 
What an amazing story. 
That cat's a hero. 
If I save it, I'm a double hero. 
Ken, I need your help. 
Well, I actually have an important church... 
Denied! 
Hey, what's going on? 
I got a message you wanted to see me? 
Yes, I know you're interviewing John Boehner later. 
You should know that he has very tiny has, so... 
Let him hold a miniature golf scoring pencil to make them look normal, obviously. 
But why are you... 
oh, my God. 
Are you trying to mentor me? 
 All right, calm down. 
 I am squared away, Donaghy. 
I get four hours of sleep a night, eat 1,200 calories a day, and my closet has been on the cover of organized living twice. 
Damn it, I knew you'd fail the test of chaos. 
Is it really that difficult to find someone new to mentor? 
It's impossible. 
I would never say this to her face, but Lemon is above average. 
She's got just the right amount of dihc for me. 
I hear it, and I don't care. 
I've cast a wide net, but even the junior executives here... 
there's something wrong with this generation. 
Hey, are you Jack? 
Sorry I'm late. 
B.T. Dubbs, 
I gotta leave for my ironic kickball league in about ten. 
Also, I'm not interested in this position unless I'm gonna be constantly praised. 
And I won't cut my hair. 
It's go time, Ken. 
Are you ready? 
I've got my hammer, I've got my mask. 
You just stop me before I get to that cat. 
I'll be right behind you. 
And finally, the weekend box office crown belonged to the indie darling hard to watch. 
Critics have been praising the gritty drama, and the performance of its star Tracy Jordan. 
Now, not to editorialize, but if Jordan doesn't win the Oscar, that would be the stupidest thing since the following segue... 
speaking of cats... 
An Oscar. 
If I won an Oscar, everyone would have to respect me. 
My obituary will read "Oscar winner" instead of "children's soccer heckler." 
It would change my headline. 
I feel like I'm forgetting something. 
I left Tracy Jr. 
in Atlantic City! 
Die, hero cat! 
I hate you! 
I said I'm gonna kill that cat! 
Killing cats is wrong! 
Unless it's to make a hat! 
My skull! 
Jenna Maroney just saved the hero cat! 
That makes me a double hero! 
Try to deny me my obit now, you jags! 
And tell people in lieu of flowers, they can pour jewels into my open coffin. 
I'm very injured. 
You wanted to see me? 
 No, Lemon. 
 I did. 
Albino ninja! 
Look, I never should have interfered with, um, whatever this is. 
 Work husbandslashuncle. 
 Coworkerslashlittle brother. 
Right, well, she's not ready to move on. 
It's true. 
I'm wearing a Duane reade bag as underwear today. 
All right. 
And for whatever reason, he needs you too. 
It's a symbiotic relationship. 
I'm a mighty great white shark, Lemon, and you are a remora, clinging to me with your suction cup head. 
I give you a free ride, and in exchange, you, uh, eat my parasites. 
I'm gonna leave you two alone. 
I already briefed him on your problem. 
The gentleman's intermission, yes. 
Uh, Lemon, does your father have a cell phone? 
Yes. Jack is back. 
If anyone can talk sense into my dad, it's you. 
Oh, no, I'm not gonna talk sense into anybody. 
Your father's being irrational. 
And irrational behavior doesn't respond to rationality. 
It responds to fear. 
Hello? 
Yeah, is this Dick Lemon? 
This is he. 
Who's calling? 
I'm tricia's boyfriend, you scumbag. 
She told me what happened with youse last night. 
Now I'm gonna come and find you, and I'm gonna kick your ass so hard, you're gonna be throwing up my toenails. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
There's been a mistake. 
I did not do anything with anyone last night. 
Certainly not a tricia. 
Oh, now you're telling me my tricia's not good enough for you? 
She's an angel! 
I'll tell you what, I'm getting my brothers, and we're coming over there, and we're gonna... 
Dick Lemon speaking. 
How dare you hang up on me. 
I'm a corrupt cop! 
My brother's a corrupt fireman. 
He's gonna set you on fire, and I am not gonna investigate it. 
That won't be necessary. 
I'm leaving for Philadelphia today. 
Dick, listen, tricia told me you're married. 
I know men are meant to be promiscuous because of evolution, but you made a commitment to a woman you love. 
I do. 
I do love her. 
Yeah, that's right. 
You're a lucky man. 
"A," because you have a family and "b," because I have not curb-stomped you in front of your grandchildren. 
Actually, I don't have grandchildren. 
Why not? 
Tricia told me you have a 40-year-old daughter. 
What's wrong with her? 
 Okay, mmmm. 
 I gotta go. 
I'm taking tricia to laser zeppelin. 
You take care now. 
Go necks! 
Can I show you a weird thing on my leg? 
Yeah. 
That's gotta be removed. 
Claire? 
Claire? 
Joanne? 
Okay. 
Well, I look forward to visiting her and her wife... 
On their farm. 
Jacqueline? 
Like, named after you? 
Like a little Jack, but with boobs? 
Hi, I'm Daphne Donaghy I saw a turtle! 
Kylie. 
Great. 
She can strip her way through community college. 
Come on. 
Oh, I don't know about Christina. 
'Cause then everyone calls her Tina. 
And every Tina I've known is a real judgmental bitch. 
From the top, one more time, guys. 
Everyone, I need your attention. 
Gather up. 
I said everyone, Sketch-Tron 6000. 
Mr. Hank Hooper, 
the owner of our new parent company, Kabletown, is touring 30 Rock for the first time today. 
I will make a good first impression, so I need all of you to be your most normal. 
Tracy, do not mention where you think dinosaurs come from. 
Do not mention the underwater city of Sauronicon... 
Got it. 
Jenna, get all of your crazy yelling out of your system. 
If you don't volumize my hair, I will choke you to death  with your boyfriend's wig! 
 Very good. 
Frank, how is your armpit thing? 
Not great. It's almost 
touching my thigh thing. 
Okay, let's do our best. 
Remember, everyone, just don't be yourselves. 
Lemon, meet me in my office in ten. 
I need to ask you something. 
Oh, do you need sex advice? 
Here's a tip. 
Sometimes a lady likes to leave her blazer on. 
Sir, ma'am, this is for you... a gift bag. 
"To my two favorite sketch stars. 
Your new friend, Hank Hooper." 
That's nice. 
Actors deserve gifts. 
Without us, who would present awards to actors? 
So...Which one of us is 
going to get this computer? 
Just kidding. 
We both are! 
Wow, I always wanted one of these. 
The box would make a perfect coffin for my Teddy Bear. 
There's two of everything! 
Look at us. 
When we met four years ago, we were fighting about the silliest things... 
Dressing rooms, air time, you coming in and ruining my show... 
You taking my nephew's virginity. 
I feel we've finally found a balance in our relationship. 
There's only one. 
You take it. 
I don't care. 
I want you to selfishly take the best sweatshirt in the world. 
Lemon, this is a little delicate, but I wonder if you might take Avery shopping for baby things. 
 Oh, sure. 
 You know, a crib, small clothes, a tiny desk with a miniature pen set on it. 
I don't know a lot about babies, but I know that Avery would enjoy having another woman go with her. 
Of course. 
I'm just a little surprised. 
I assumed Avery would have a terrifying best friend she'd do stuff like that with. 
Avery does have a sister, but Eugenia is currently institutionalized for nerves... 
 Lesbian... 
And all of her work friends are out because she's still trying to keep her pregnancy a secret. 
Really? 
She's eight months. 
How is she possibly hiding it? 
Michael Kors is a friend. 
We own a gay racehorse together. 
And I convinced him to make wizard cloaks fashionable for ladies this winter. 
It's my fault for asking. 
The problem is that Avery is very close to being named the financial reporter for NBC Nightly News. 
If anyone finds out she's pregnant, she won't get the job. 
Ah, see, that would never happen if men could get pregnant. 
Which is the premise of my one-act play The Seahorses of Warwickshire Abbey. 
Avery just needs to keep her condition under wraps until her contract is signed. 
Unfortunately, her competition for the job is Carmen Chao... 
From MSNBC. 
Oh, I know her. 
Hey, what ethnicity is she? 
No one knows. 
In international news, Mexican president Felipe Calderon is traveling this week to China to meet with premier Wen Jiabao, and then stopping for a well-deserved vacation in Negril, Jamaica, mon. 
If Carmen finds out Avery's pregnant, she'll use it to destroy her. 
Carmen's very sneaky. 
And that's not racist because I don't know what she is. 
Man, we all lead such complicated lives. 
Hey, do you want to go to that new popcorn place for lunch? 
I'm going to the executive dining room to meet with Hank Hooper. 
I can't wait to shake his hand. 
You can tell a lot about someone by their handshake. 
You are confident. 
And you ate dinner in front of a mirror last night. 
Carol's away a lot. 
Ahoy there, Jack. 
Hank Hooper. 
Nice to meet you. 
I'm a hugger. 
No. Doesn't count 
as a hug unless it goes on for ten seconds. 
Yeah. 
Well, it is an honor, sir, to finally... 
I'm no "sir," Jack. 
Call me Hank. 
Or "hey, idiot," like my wife does. 
I'm kidding. 
She's an angel. 
Hey, Jack. 
What are you doing here? 
No, it's fine, Jack. 
Kabletown's a family company, and where I come from, families eat together. 
This is no longer the executive dining room. 
It's the Everyone dining room. 
Welcome, everyone. 
This is where we used to hold retirement parties. 
The balcony below is probably still littered with stripper bones. 
And now there are people here wearing sandals. 
 Yeah. 
 Isn't that nice? 
Listen, can I tell you how happy I am with the work you've done for us so far? 
It's been outstanding. 
Thank you. And believe me, 
I'm not done. 
I'm working on something new right now that I think... 
Room for a single? 
Sure. 
Let me ask you a question. 
Do you know who came up with the idea for the DVR? 
It was the guy who drives me home every night. 
The original name for the DVR was "The Thing Carlos Thought Of." 
Since then, I make sure that once a month, anyone who works here can pitch any idea they have to upper management. 
 Anyone? 
 Mm. 
Mmm. 
 I see. 
 So I want you to hear ideas all day tomorrow, and then report back to me. 
I'll be the guy wearing the Bugs Bunny tie. 
 Ha! 
 What is this green stuff? 
Wipe it off. 
Wipe it off! 
Ecch, these pregnancy photos are so tacky. 
They're like those knockoff bags  you get in Chinatown. 
 Really? 
I like pradort bag. 
Avery Jessup. 
Que sorpresa! 
Carmen! 
What are you doing here. 
Oh, I just love babies. 
I love their creepy little hands and the way they crawl fast, like a rat monster. 
Question is, what are you doing here. 
Oh, she's here with me. 
I'm pregnant, and Avery is helping me decide what kind of baby megaphone to buy. 
Really? 
 You're the pregnant one? 
 Yeah. 
Some dude jacked me, and now his sperm is growing in my stomach. 
That's now how babies are made. 
We're gonna go. 
You're tired. 
Oh, you'll find this interesting. 
I'm working on a story right now about single mothers in their 40s. 
 That's a great idea. 
 So you'll be in it? 
Why wouldn't you be? 
You just said it was a great idea, and you're pregnant, right? 
So by the law of verbal traps, you have to do it. 
Okay, Carmen, I'll be in your story. 
You can interview me at the new popcorn place on 11th Avenue. 
No, we'll do it at your office. 
Fine. I'll just go 
to the popcorn place alone, even though all their advertising suggests it is a place for groups of friends to have a good time. 
Hello. 
Good sweatshirt to you. 
How are you sweatshirting this sweatshirt? 
Is everything all right, Tracy? 
I want that sweatshirt! 
No. You can't take this 
away from me, like you took away my show. 
And my grandmother's jewelry chest. 
Was I supposed to throw up in something of mine? 
You gave this to me. 
And I can take it back. 
I'm the star here. 
And if there's only one sweatshirt, the star should have it. 
Look how gray it is. 
Let me just hold it for one second. 
Well...Okay. 
But just one second. 
You'll never get her! 
Stop! 
Sweatshirty is a boy! 
Miss Lemon. 
Carmen Chao called about an interview. 
Is she doing an expose on how feminism has led to a happiness crisis among educated women? 
No, Kenneth, it's nothing. 
I'm gonna call Jack and make it go away. 
Check this out. 
I was up in the Everybodydining room, sharing a table with B. Dubs here, 
and guess what he told me. 
Okay, gossip alert. 
According to my colleague Carmen Chao, our friend Liz Lemon is pregnant. 
Dude, is that true? 
 Are you pregnant? 
 Isn't that wonderful news? 
Lemon told me this morning she got jacked big time. 
Uh, Lemon, a word? 
What the hell is gong on? 
Thank you for covering for Avery last night. 
But now you're a part of this, and Carmen Chao is relentless! 
Like a bloodhound. 
Perhaps literally. 
We still don't know her genetic background. 
So what, now people think I'm pregnant? 
Do I have to do this mom news story? 
There is no news story. 
Carmen isn't getting anywhere with Avery, so she's trying to call your bluff. 
Well, it is called. 
I am telling everyone here that there's no way I could be pregnant because I have had my period for the last 61 days. 
Lemon, please. 
Avery's career has never been more important because I just don't know what's happening with mine! 
 What? Why? 
 Oh... 
The Everyone dining room, open office hours, memos with emoticons in them! 
If this is how Kabletown does business, I don't know if I have a future here. 
I'm Jack Donaghy! 
Don Geiss gave me this watch for firing a man on his deathbed! 
So wait, you might leave? 
I don't know if I can survive here. 
So I need you to fake being pregnant to help my family. 
I'm asking you as a friend. 
How come when I try to get you to go to a murder-mystery party with me, it's all, "we're business colleagues, Lemon"? 
Ugh, I don't know why I ever chose you as a friend. 
Let's just be clear about this... I chose you. 
I heard the blessed news, Liz. 
May I kiss your stomach? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Hello, beautiful. 
It's Uncle Wutzy. 
Oh, hey, Jack, you and I have a pitch meeting later. 
You're a baby. 
Yes, you are. 
Yes, you're a baby... 
So that's basically the show. 
And my sidekick is a hot black chick who can read minds. 
We need a button that switches from pornography to basketball immediately. 
What you have isn't fast enough. 
My kids are starting to ask questions that I can't answer. 
This'll just be a minute. 
Did you check the lightbulb? 
Please do not use that tone. 
So much of television is really not fit for children or christians or the elderly. 
So what if there was a black bar on the lower half of your TV screen that kept you from seeing bad things? 
Like nudity, or soccer. 
Congratulations. 
Worst so far! 
Liz, I never get anything. 
All I want is one sweatshirt. 
Don't listen to her. 
She's not me. 
What is going on? 
 This is mine. 
 The story begins when dolphins ruled the earth. 
Hey, guys, lay off Liz, okay? 
 You know she's pregnant. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Superpregnant. 
 Congratulations. 
I am not interested in godfather duties. 
Now's not the time to discuss this, but I will need to eat your umbilical cord. 
I'm sorry we were stressing you out. 
We shouldn't do that. 
It'll turn the child into a Dracula. 
I'm sorry. 
You know what, give me the sweatshirt. 
Problem solved. 
Now no one gets it. 
 Aw, man... 
  Pregnant. 
Now get out of here! 
And hold hands like best friends on the way out. 
Oh, that is like magic. 
People are nice to pregnant ladies. 
I'm gonna run downstairs. 
Do you want anything? 
Remember, you're eating for two. 
Well, I guess two egg sandwiches... 
Times two is four. 
Good morning! 
So how did co-worker pitch day go, Jack? 
Well, employee pitch day was, of course, a new experience for me. 
Oh, speaking of new experiences, I ate at an Indian restaurant last night. 
I had naan. 
Sir... I mean, Hank, 
I appreciate that you have your way of doing things, but so do I. 
I am a six sigma black belt ultra, with the groin branding to prove it. 
What's six sigma? 
Rock band? 
I'd like to start this meeting by sharing one of my own ideas. 
And after you hear it, maybe we can agree that employee pitch day is time that could be better spent drinking and looking out the window. 
Okay, Jack! 
You're putting it on the line. 
What have you got? 
Hank, what's the one part of the television experience that's not perfect? 
To me, it's the remote control. 
Too easy to lose, right? 
Yes! I lose my remote 
all the time. 
Grr, couch cushions! 
What if you didn't need a remote control because your remote control was your own voice? 
Television on. 
Channel, NBC. 
A crew out of the Bronx called the Ace of Deuces. 
Amazing. 
I give you voice activation. 
Word from my C.I. 
is he got offed by... 
That shouldn't happen. 
TV on! 
Voice activation, or "vo-act..." 
The only wit we have is some mute kid... 
 Unmute! 
 My friends at the D.E.A. say 
these guys have a high volume of cocaine... 
Low volume. 
Low volume! 
First I want to go home and delete everything  that's on my DVR. 
 Oh, come on! 
TV mute! 
Jack, it doesn't seem to work. 
You got any other notions, or should we jump to employee ideas? 
No, no. No. 
I have another idea. 
What if, uh... 
What if... 
You had a black bar at the bottom of the screen that prevented you from seeing anything dirty? 
I like that. 
I like that a lot. 
It would allow parents to eliminate racy content, like soccer, or a woman stuffing a turkey. 
That's a real family company kind of idea, Jack. 
And we could sell ads in the black bar... 
Increase our revenue streams! 
You could call it "Blabar." 
A-plus work, Jack! 
I don't need to hear anything else. 
If that's the kind of ideas you're bringing... nine, ten... 
You will go far, son. 
Yeah! 
Crap. 
Kenneth, we need to talk. 
Earlier today, I told Hank Hooper about your black bar concept, and he loved it. 
However, I presented it as my own idea. 
Wonderful! Next topic. 
What? Uh, no. 
This is an opportunity for you. 
You have me over a barrel. 
What are you going to do? 
Not what my uncle does when he gets a hitchhiker over a barrel, I'll tell you that. 
This is business, Kenneth. 
All bosses steal from their employees. 
But in return, the employee gets something. 
You didn't steal anything from me, sir. 
Last time I checked, best friends can't steal from each other. 
Now, stop being a silly Simon. 
This isn't how it works! 
You're the one being a silly Simon! 
Carmen, what are you doing here? 
Well, you didn't call back to schedule our interview, so I thought I'd just ambush you with some pregnancy questions. 
I hope you're not unprepared. 
Of course not. 
 When are you due? 
 April 20th, Hitler's birthday. 
What's your pediatrician's name? 
Dr. Rufus T. Barleysheath. 
 Where was the baby conceived? 
 In my vagina. 
What names are you considering? 
 Rufus T. Barleysheath. 
 How are you feeling? 
Oh, a little achy and nauseous,  but I'm hanging in there. 
 Are you pregnant? 
No...way that I'm not. 
Owen, screw. 
I don't know why you're doing this for Jessup. 
She's a blonde. Don't you know 
there's a war going on? 
Or are you doing it for her old man husband? 
He's your boss. 
First of all, Jack means nothing to me. 
Shoot him in the throat and let the dogs eat him. 
I don't care. 
What's wrong with you? 
Almost everything. 
But let's get back to the interview. 
We're done with that portion. 
I thought it would be a fun visual if we got some b-roll of you taking sexy pregnancy photos where you bare your stomach like the pregnant bitch that you are. 
What do you say? 
Let's take some pictures. 
Innovation that is both family and bottom line friendly. 
Gentlemen, I give you Blabar. 
You're really sexing me right now. 
It's filthy. 
Jack! Jack! 
All: Jack! Jack! Jack... 
One time, I saw a turtle... 
Who the hell do you think you are? 
This is not the way the world works, Kenneth. 
Bosses steal, and employees use it for leverage. 
So what do you want? 
Money? A promotion? 
I can get you into a restaurant where you watch a child play with a bunny, then you eat the bunny. 
Isn't that just Easter? 
And I don't want anything, sir. 
I'm just happy to spend all day here helping my work family. 
Family. 
I now work for a man who thinks like you. 
Does he also solve mazes by starting from the end? 
I need this, Kenneth. 
I used you, now leverage it. 
Blackmail me. 
Demand to sleep with Avery. 
Hit me. 
Hit me in the face! 
No, sir. 
Best friends don't... 
I am ordering you to strike me. 
There will be no retaliation, but if you refuse, you're fired. 
No. 
I don't even know how. 
Do it! Hit me now! 
Oh, damn my krav maga training and lightning reflexes! 
Release me, you hillbilly Circe! 
I am life. 
Revel in the glory of motherhood! 
Gaia flows through me. 
Rufus T. Barleysheath 
is kicking. 
I know you're not pregnant. 
Why don't you just admit it? 
She's grabbing oil. 
Owen...Run! 
Look how my belly glistens! 
What's going on, Jack? 
I was just about to hop on my bus back to Philadelphia. 
I don't fly, but I got my own bus with a pool table in it. 
We'll drive to Branson together sometime, take in a Yakov Smirnoff show. 
Doesn't Russia sound like a crazy place? 
Yes, sir. 
But before you go, I want you to meet someone. 
This is Kenneth Parcell, one of our pages. 
Oh, I didn't notice you there, son. 
You do not have a lot of charisma. 
Kenneth is the one who came up with the Blabar idea, not me. 
 I'm sorry I misled you. 
 Oh. 
Well, Jack, I have to say I'm surprised. 
Here is my letter of resignation. 
It's probably for the best since this is obviously not a good fit. 
If you call security to escort me out, you should know I have several pistols hidden on me. 
Hold on, Jack. 
No one's quitting. 
I'm impressed you told me that. 
You have a reputation, Jack, as a shark. 
Kabletown, we're not sharks. 
We're more like... 
Whatever the friendliest fish is. 
I'm not a science guy. 
The point is, I wasn't sure how you were gonna fit in, but you doing something like this tells me we're gonna be just fine. 
Very well. Good. 
And Jack should give you something  for that idea, son. 
 Finally. Thank you. 
 Quid pro quo. 
 But I don't want anything. 
No? 
How about a hug? 
You've gotta be kidding me. 
 Heh... 
 Sir... 
It doesn't count as a hug unless it goes on for ten seconds. 
You got that right, son. 
One...Mississippi... 
That's some good hugging. 
And as excited as I am to be joining the team on Nightly News, I will miss my dear friends here on basic cable. 
But, Carmen, you have an exciting new assignment, right? 
Yes. I will be 
covering hurricanes... 
Thank you, Lemon. 
I owe you. 
If you want to make it up to me, I have my eye on a toilet pillow from a certain medical supply store. 
Avery and I want the baby's middle name to be Elizabeth, after you. 
Oh, Jack, that's so gayballs. 
Hey, Liz. 
Can we get you anything? 
Do you need some liniment rubbed on your perineum? 
No, guys, I'm not really pregnant. 
I was just pretending to help Jack. 
Why would you pretend to help Jack? 
Help him for real. 
It takes the same amount of time. 
No, Tracy, she lied to us. 
And she ordered us around like we were a couple of normals. 
You will be punished. 
Can I have my nunchucks back? 
Or we could call it even. 
Good God! 
I have been punished. 
These are yours to keep. 
What? 
Who's the black guy? 
A bicycle messenger. 
You took your pants off. 
What if there was a channel that's just the sound of people having a party  so you put it on when you call your parents? 
You know what my TV is? 
A sunset. 
How about a button you push on your remote and you can buy anything you see on TV? 
Like if you're watching Sex and the City and you just have to have Mr. Big's spaghetti? 
What if we executed someone live on TV? 
And then I pull off my mask and I'm a lizard person too. 
Blackout. End of episode. 
 Hush, little baby   tomorrow you shuck the cane   your little fingers bloody   prepare to be whipped  She's asleep. 
Hey, it's mommy! 
 I'm in Beijing! 
 Shh. 
 Liddy just went to sleep. 
 Well, wake here up, Jack. 
She needs to hear her mommy's voice. 
No, when she's ready, Dr. Kevorkian says 
we have to put her down. 
He's a very good pediatrician, but that is an unfortunate name. 
Oh, come on, she'll fall back asleep. 
No. Call back tomorrow. 
She has babynomics at 11:00. 
Liddy! It's your mother! 
Imprinting! Imprinting! 
God, Tracy could have cleaned up before he left. 
And why did he leave all this soda here? 
What are you doing? 
That's his urine. 
He is not well. 
Someday this place is gonna be a kickass duplex, like on Different Strokes. 
Conrad bain once slapped me in a men's room. 
I've just gotta get rid of all these boxes. 
I don't even know what this stuff is anymore. 
Comence a estudiar these, but then yo gave up. 
Here's the novel I never finished. 
Hmm... 
"Liz stabbed Jenna repeatedly." 
The Secret? 
I gave you this five years ago. 
 You still haven't read it? 
 Ehh... 
It works, Liz. 
Look at me. 
Ever since I started secreting, I've become a TV star, I found my soul mate, you saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow sang at the oscars... 
I visualized all of that. 
Jenna, the only way to make things happen in the real world is by taking action. 
Oh, I've taken action. 
It dries your mouth out, but the sex is amazing. 
No, I'm talking about taking control. 
Like I do every day at work. 
I found Tracy, I saved the show. 
I always think of a third thing when I'm listing stuff. 
If taking control is so great, then how do you explain your personal life? 
I mean, look at the post-it note on your sweater. 
Oh, boy. 
You're right. 
I just have to care about myself as much as I care about work. 
Starting right now. 
I'm gonna clean this apartment while I learn Spanish. 
Last year, I used The Secret to learn Spanish, and now I'm fluent. 
Rosa, I know you stole my necklace. 
I'll have your son deported. 
Oh, wait, I found my necklace. 
Oh, boy. 
Great news, Jack. 
I've got a new life philosophy that I call Lizbeanism. 
I see. And how did you 
come up with that name? 
Well, I'm Liz, and obviously, my philosophy is simple, like a bean. 
I'm fixing problems in my personal life the same way I fix problems at work. 
I saved the show, now I'm gonna save me! 
Because lizbeanism means that I am a dyke... 
against the rising waters of mediocrity. 
 Good for you, Lemon. 
 Check this out, Jack. 
Tile samples. 
First, I redo the bathroom, then I redo the whole apartment, and then the world. 
I'm impressed, Lemon. 
You're talking like a winner. 
I'm going to give you... 
One of my neckties. 
This is a big moment for me. 
You're taking control of your destiny. 
No matter how strait the gate or charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. 
That's from Invictus! 
Wait, who was the white guy in that? 
Maybe someday you'll be like me, running a billion-dollar corporation, having people pay you for the privilege of cutting your hair... 
raising a child. 
You're raising a child? 
Come on. 
I think Avery is probably doing that. 
Not really. Avery's been 
traveling a lot as part of NBC news' hot blondes in weird places initiative. 
So she's been out of the baby loop until Liddy is sleep-trained. 
Frankly, it might be easier if Avery stays in Asia. 
Be careful what you wish for. 
According to The Secret, it'll come true. 
I wish Liz Lemon would leave so I could go back to work. 
Oh... oh... 
What's pulling me? 
I want to stay here and keep boring Jack! 
Oh, okay. 
I really fell. 
I need help. 
Tracy, welcome back. 
I think I speak for all of us when I say how thrilled Great impression of a guy that sucks, dotcom. 
Look, we got a lot of work to catch up on. 
Yes, sir. 
It just feels so good to have the three musketeers and dotcom back together again. 
Ooh. Whoops. 
Smooth move, Ferguson. 
What are you laughing about? 
Oh, nothing, sir. 
Just an inside joke from when you were gone. 
You kinda needed to be there. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
No. 
You three are not allowed to have inside jokes that I'm not a part of. 
I can have inside jokes that you're not a part of. 
For example, "hot feet." 
Or, "ask Melissa about it." 
But my entourage serves me. 
And "smooth move, Ferguson" is not funny to me. 
So it id forbidden. 
Understand? 
Next order of business, Grizz's DVD reviews for this weekend. 
You wouldn't expect a movie called Somewhere to go absolutely nowhere. 
 Sometimes we use a song to move a story along   and explain it to you whoo!  
 'cause Liz is taking charge   she's in control of everything she do   in her personal life   hey hey, na na   in her personal life   but here comes a story obstacle now!  
What's that? 
Tony, there's a bag in that tree, and it's right outside the window of my soon-to-be-perfect-life apartment. 
If you're not in the building, I don't have to talk to you. 
Trees are city property. 
You have to take it up with City Hall. 
That's your mother, Liddy. 
Say hello. 
Who's ready for Skype sex? 
 No, this is the Liddy call. 
 What I can't see? 
You people have too much money. 
Hi, Sherry! 
I don't know why our daughter would be afraid of Reagan. 
Are you accusing me of not doing enough Reagan time with her? 
No, of course not. 
Listen, news wants me to extend the trip. 
But I can get out of it if you need me there to help. 
No. You stay. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm sure. 
Bring back some throwing stars for Liddy. 
I will. 
And thank you for being the best husband ever. 
Hey, do you want to watch me eat jelly beans... 
Real slow? 
Yes. 
Smooth move, Ferguson. 
I knew it! 
I knew you were saying that behind my back. 
 How long were you in there? 
 I knew you wouldn't stop! 
And now your failure leaves us with only one option. 
Explain to me why "smooth move, Ferguson" is funny! 
Well, while you were away, we ordered Mexican food. 
And the delivery guy tripped, and then mister Griswald said, "smooth move, Ferguson." 
That story is not funny! 
Sir, you had to be there. 
Then I will be. 
We are going to recreate all the events surrounding "smooth move, Ferguson" exactly as they occurred. 
Maybe then we can get on with our lives. 
Let's get to work. 
Jonathan, what is going on? 
Sir, you need to see this. 
Even if it ruins whatever you had planned for Secretary's Day, like a poem you wrote for me, or whatever. 
We go now to a pre-taped statement from super-crazy Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il. 
People of North Korea, it is your dear leader, Kim Jong-Il, world's greatest golfer and movie director, and best man at Tom Brady's wedding. 
As we all know, the decadent Western journalist spy Laura Ling left us because she can't party as hard as we can. 
 I know, right? 
 I know, right? 
But now, another American reporter has come to North Korea because it's awesome, and we have enough food. 
Avery Jessup. 
Her name is Avery Jessup, and like me, her hair is blonde. 
One of our own, NBC's Avery Jessup Donaghy, detained in North Korea. 
More on that as it develops. 
But first, it's never too early to plan your dog's Halloween costume. 
I told her to stay. 
I didn't want her at home. 
This is my fault. 
Sir, if you say one more syllable, that's a haiku. 
Leave. 
I'm not afraid of you, City Hall. 
Let's do this. 
Don't go in there! 
Run, citizen! 
Look, Boehner, we're all upset. 
I mean it's my wife! 
John, stop crying. 
I--I can't understand you! 
 I said he's busy! 
 Busy, Jonathan? 
I've got a bag stuck in a tree. 
Jack, I have a bag stuck in a tree outside my apartment, and I can't get it down. 
And I don't know why it's making me so crazy. 
Yes, you do. 
You said it yourself. 
It's not just about a bag or a view. 
It's about taking charge of your life and solving problems. 
I'm facing a similar situation myself. 
Lay it on me. 
Two-way street. 
Avery has been kidnapped by Kim Jong-Il. 
What? Why? 
Is she a spy? 
Oh, my God, I already know too much! 
Kim Jong-Il runs a vast propaganda machine. 
Evidently, his latest insane idea is to bring in a Western journalist to report on how the free world is being conquered by North Korea. 
And in food news, you've had enough to eat today. 
Now here with the weather is Johnny Mountain. 
North Korea, everything sunny all the time. 
Always good-time beach party. 
Back to you, Avery. 
You have to call president Clinton. 
He got Lisa Ling's sister out of North Korea. 
President Inter-Bush is out of the question. 
Avery will never accept his help. 
She can't forgive him for not hitting on her during the 1996 Democratic convention. 
 She's much too thin. 
 I do, of course, still have some connections, but my best bet is fraught. 
I never should have broken up with Condi via text message. 
You broke up with Condoleezza Rice by text? 
Me plus you equals frowny face. 
 Yeah, you can't call her. 
 I know. 
But I am going to solve this. 
Just like you are going to solve your equally important bag in a tree situation. 
Invictus, Lemon. 
Now that I've killed that bug, I'd like to call this "smooth move, Ferguson" recreation meeting to order. 
Kenneth, report. 
Well, sir, we've got the delivery guy booked, but I've run into some big problems. 
For example, it was raining that day. 
Get a rain machine. 
Look, here, take my credit card, use it to break into a special effects warehouse to steal one. 
Well, sir, even if we did that, there are some things we can't control. 
We don't remember what we were wearing. 
Dotcom was sick. 
Security footage. 
Dotcom licks the subway steps. 
These are solvable problems! 
Well, what about this? 
Miss Maroney was here screaming at Mr. Rossitano. 
Later that day, she got her hair cut. 
Aw, thank you. 
The point is, her hair was longer then. 
J-Mo, how long would it take for your hair to grow back? 
It depends. Do you have access 
to horse semen? 
 You know I do. 
 Give me three weeks. 
Then we'll reconvene in three weeks. 
Meeting is adjourned. 
Oh, my God, what happened to my bug? 
Stupid grappling hook! 
Can't catch one little bag? 
You think I'm giving up? 
Did I give up when that squirrel I trained to retrieve you just ran away? 
You will not win, Mr. bag. 
But, Liz, I already have. 
What did you say? 
Jack's wrong. 
No human is truly the master of his fate. 
Even your dream apartment can't protect you from death. 
I'm not ruining your view. 
I'm reminding you of your mortality. 
'Cause you know I'll be here long after you're gone, the wind rustling against my genitals. 
That's right, bags have genitals. 
You don't know me. 
Go ahead, buy nesting tables. 
Paint an accent wall. 
I'll watch the EMTs take you out in my cousin, a body bag. 
K-9, operation Ferguson status report. 
Rain, check. 
Room temperature, check. 
Miss Maroney's hair length, check. 
Do you like it? 
If you say no, I'll drown myself. 
Mr. griswald, 
could you put the TV on the right channel MSNBC. 
Was dotcom standing that gay? 
No, sir, he was not. 
Today denying reports that Jessup Donaghy is anchoring a fake Western news channel, calling the accusations, quote, "as ridiculous as the dunk Kim Jong-Il won the NBA dunk contest with." 
Hey, what's my boy KJ doing on TV? 
What? 
That's Kim Jong-Il. 
Yeah. 
We did a movie together that he directed and co-starred in. 
Death to the CIA! 
Let us all increase production of millet and sunflowers! 
I defuse bomb, black partner. 
Hasta la vista, baby! 
Dude, I think you did a North Korean propaganda film. 
It was either that or playing a rapping doorman in a Kate Hudson movie. 
Oh, okay. 
Oh, he's coming. 
Places, everyone. 
Smooth move, Ferguson. 
I get it now! 
That was so funny! 
Everyone laugh. 
Now, you sons of bitches! 
Tracy, it's come to my attention that you know Kim Jong-Il. 
And obviously, I'm concerned about my wife, and I want to know what she's going through. 
Please, hold nothing back. 
Okay, but you might not like what I have to tell you. 
Kim Jong-Il sometimes shoots in a close-up too much. 
Comedy lives in a wide shot. 
And also this is gonna be rough his acting notes are often vague. 
Okay. Thank you. 
What is this? 
My God! 
They're letting her speak. 
For the past three weeks, I have been honored to partake in a political re-education regimen. 
I have voluntarily taken several floggings for being an arrogant American... 
That's okay. 
She's tough. 
We do a lot of pirate-themed sexual role playing. 
I'm a parrot. 
Also, I spend eight hours a day breaking concrete blocks to learn to be an obedient worker... 
No problem. 
She pays $1,000 an hour to do that with a trainer. 
And I have concluded that capitalism may be flawed. 
My God! 
What are those monsters doing to her? 
Doctor Rice... 
Well, look what the cat dragged in. 
Hello, Condi. 
You're looking well. 
You know, I've been to the DMZ. 
They have signs. 
Can your wife not read? 
 Okay, we're all adults here. 
 So what is it? 
Is she funnier than I am? 
She's certainly not younger, is she? 
Condi, we are not doing this. 
Oh, we are doing this! 
I'm sorry that I broke up with you by text. 
I'm sorry I went drinking with Karl Rove... 
on Valentine's day. 
I'm sorry that I said your favorite movie was lame. 
Mars Attacks! is awesome! 
Now admit that I'm better at the piano  than you are at the flute. 
 Never. 
      Follow this, you turkey. 
  All right, damn it. 
You are better. 
I'll see what I can do, Jack. 
Now get out of here before this gets weird. 
You're the turkey. 
Know what, Mr. bag? 
I will have a nice day! 
I'm gonna hang you in my kitchen and fill you with other bags. 
You will eat your family! 
Hey, that's city property. 
Put the saw down. 
 No, I almost got him. 
 Right now! 
Don't think I won't taser you, all right? 
I've got OCD, and I love doing paperwork. 
Aah, it was worth it! 
Avery? 
Jack! 
Oh, thank God! 
I forgot the U.S. 
country code, but then I remembered it's number one. 
How are you calling me? 
Nobody has ever seen an iPhone. 
I told them it was my razor. 
I have to shave my legs with it, but they have an app for that. 
Oh, Avery, I'm sorry. 
This is all my fault. 
I told you to stay. 
No, this is nobody's fault. 
Except maybe that pansy Harry Truman for not taking down this country  when he had the chance. 
 Truman! 
Look, my battery's dying, and the outlets here are shaped weird. 
And I don't think they have any electricity in them anyway. 
So I don't want you to worry about me. 
They actually love me here. 
I already won a North Korean Emmy. 
So if I don't ever make it home... 
Avery, don't say that. 
I spoke... 
To Condoleezza. 
Really? 
Did you also call Sally Ride and her sister? 
Come on, Avery, not now. 
I am going to get you out of there. 
You are married to Jack Donaghy, damn it, and the world doesn't get to do this to us! 
We control our fates! 
We are in charge! 
Avery? 
Are you still there? 
I'm sure her battery died right after I finished that speech. 
Just like I wanted it to. 
Smooth move, Ferguson! 
Ha ha ha! 
 Smooth move, Ferguson. 
 Mr. Jordan, 
please let it go. 
It's just a joke it's not about the joke. 
It's about what the joke represents, you monsters! 
What do you mean, sir? 
I came back, and you were fine without me. 
You laughed without me! 
And that was our special thing! 
But no, you thought smooth move, Ferguson, was so hilarious! 
It wasn't. 
It wasn't funny! 
There, are you happy? 
You just dropped a bomb, K. 
Continue. 
We were miserable without you, sir. 
"Smooth move, Ferguson" was trying to fill a void because Mr. Slattery's 
political cartoons weren't cutting it. 
I can't draw hands. 
You're the one who makes us laugh. 
Never go away again. 
Don't ever tell me what to do! 
Quad hug, me in the middle! 
Also, due to a paperwork mix-up, you will not be getting paid this month. 
I did it, Jack. 
I got the bag. 
You were right. 
No matter how much the gate is strait, or who punishes the scrolls, I am the captain of my holes, or whatever. 
We are in control! 
No, we aren't. 
I was wrong. 
Condi tried, but Avery plus freedom equals... 
Frowny face. 
I'm sorry, what's happening? 
They're never going to let her go. 
Avery is now married to Kim Jong-Il's son... 
Kim Jong-Un. 
What? 
Nooo! 
Mortality! 
Smooth move, Ferguson. 
Put that coffee down. 
Coffee for closer only! 
I'm here from Park and Kim. 
I'm here on a mission of mercy. 
 Your name Levine? 
 Yeah. 
You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch? 
I don't have to listen to this. 
No, you don't, pal. 
'Cause the good news is you're fired! 
Oh, have I got your attention now? 
 The leads are weak. 
 The leads are weak? 
You're weak! 
Luke, I am your father. 
Ghostbusters! 
Let's go, black partner. 
﻿1 Happy New Year, congratulations on getting married, sir. 
I know I didn't deserve to be invited so I thought I'd give your gift now. 
Not if it's a song. 
It's not. 
It's... 
This belt. 
Oh. 
Well, the nuptials were perfect. 
We rented a villa on St. Esclavage. 
For my second wedding, I just wanted a five-minute ceremony surrounded by one giant party, so the service was performed by an exiled French admiral/defrocked minister. 
Well, I'm glad it went smoothly. 
  You and I...  
 Uh, the only hiccup was that my best man, deep sea explorer and raconteur Bob Ballard, took ill after eating some bad toucan. 
So, uh, Lemon filled in as my best man. 
This is from St. Esclavage. 
It's my marriage certificate. 
Oh, good God. 
Liz Lemon, I want it to be noted that I'm here on time. 
This is a new year and a fresh start for me. 
Now I got to go. 
Where are you going? 
I'm hosting the International Pornography Awards. 
And I have to go get an insurance physical so I can fly into the arena in a penis-shaped parachute. 
Hey, what is going on with Jenna's dressing room? 
Jack rented it out to an I.T. company. 
The Kabletown board is meeting this week to approve buying NBC, and he's doing everything possible to make us seem profitable. 
He turned the green room into an NBC experience store. 
And we have to schedule our rehearsals around the bat mitzvahs Jack has booked in the studio. 
When Madison was born, I said, "Rivka, my schveltz is filled with schpoinkis." 
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk to Jack about this. 
I'm sure he's still in a good mood from the wedding. 
 Oh, yeah, how was that? 
 Total chaos... 
No rehearsal, no program, the bride wore a black cocktail dress. 
The airline lost my luggage, and the only place to buy anything on the island was at the tennis pro shop. 
Luckily, I had the essentials in my carry-on... 
toiletries, closed-toe shoes, and the state department recommended mosquito head nets. 
I sense more complaining in you. 
Terrible flower girl. 
At four years old, you should know how to pace your petal distribution. 
Hannah, petal, step, petal, step. 
Come on! 
And don't even get me started on the monkeys. 
You! 
It needs to see Mr. Donaghy. 
It needs to see him right away. 
Get us all our stuff back. 
 Hey. 
 Elizabeth, shut the door. 
Lemon, during my wedding ceremony, do you remember being asked a question by the minister? 
Yeah. 
It was something like... 
And in spite of not understanding, you responded, "Oui." 
Well, one of my new year's resolutions is to say yes... 
yes to love, yes to life, yes to staying in more. 
Do you remember signing this document afterwards? 
Yeah. 
The minister told me to... 
On the epouse line. 
Witness. 
Not witness. 
No, Lemon... 
Wife. 
Mother... 
Vous partagez? 
C'est tres europeen. 
Est-ce que je peux vous joindre dans votre partage? 
Oui. 
They married us by mistake? 
It is a clerical error that will be rectified immediately. 
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that happens when there is no order, no planning. 
Hitler and Martha Stewart would have hated that wedding. 
Of course, it's everyone else's fault that the minister thought the lady in the white dress and the veil was the bride. 
It was a men's tennis shirt and a government-sanctioned head net. 
You kept holding on to my arm. 
It's hard to balance on sand. 
Who wears shoes on a beach? 
Only Rocky and Apollo Creed during the training montage. 
Who cares? 
You're fixing it. 
I'm sorry you got caught up in another one of Liz Lemon's adventures. 
My adventures... 
I am the protagonist. 
Avery is in China right now covering an economic conference. 
She is not a spy. 
I want this taken care of before she gets back. 
Divorce papers are being drawn up. 
Try to sign on the right line. 
Whatever you say, dear. 
Do not. 
Do not. 
Don't forget, honey, we have bridge with the Cunninghams tonight. 
Tracy, you are going to die... 
What? 
No! 
When I tell you who I'm dating. 
Squeaky fromme. 
She is difficult. 
Anyhoo, I have the results of your physical. 
Tracy, you are going to die. 
What? 
No! 
You have no reflexes. 
Your blood tastes like root beer. 
And some of your bones appear to have vanished. 
Now, I've only ever seen this kind of thing on dead people during operation Desert Storm. 
I actually wrote a report on it, but my commander refused to pass it on up to Saddam. 
Kooky times. 
But I can't die, Dr. Space-Man. 
Who will be there to raise my kids if I'm not around to pay someone to raise my kids? 
Look, making even minor changes to your unhealthy lifestyle would help, like diet and exercise. 
Well, we tried. 
Oh, look, I'm sorry, Tracy. 
But on the bright side, at least your family's financially set for life. 
Now, this could literally kill you. 
Lollipop? 
Thank you for taking in Miss Maroney, Mr. Baker. 
We would have asked you sooner, but we forgot you worked here. 
Thank you for doing this, Danny. 
It's gonna be fun. 
Yeah. 
It's like... 
it's like we're married. 
Now, don't you two start bickering like old married folks. 
Are you okay? 
It's just I got a haircut, and you didn't even notice. 
Sorry. 
You get your hair cut every week. 
Excuse me? 
I don't like your tone. 
And I don't like what you've turned into. 
I'm not the one who forgot our one-minute anniversary. 
Finally, as the merger progresses, you'll notice some changes to your benefits, including new health care options. 
I'm sorry. That should read 
"few health care options." 
I've got to redo this. 
You have to talk to Jack. 
I can't lose my dental. 
There's a hygienist there whose boob sometimes touches my ear. 
Yeah, go upstairs and tell your boyfriend to help us. 
Jack is not my boyfriend. 
He is, dot-dot-dot, my husband. 
On your wedding night, did he take you in the French fashion? 
No, there was a mix-up in St. Esclavage, 
and Jack and I are technically married. 
Oh, my God. 
Did you hear what I asked you before? 
Liz, you should know that NBC has strict antinepotism guidelines. 
If your husband is your boss, then you're both going to have to come to my office and discuss this. 
What? No. 
It's not real. 
 We're getting a divorce. 
 That's what Ann Curry and Subhas the janitor tried to tell me. 
That was five years ago. 
No, it's a mistake. 
We are signing something tomorrow. 
Wait, Liz, we can use this. 
Jack needs a divorce. 
You have leverage. 
What are you talking about? 
You don't sign any divorce papers until we get the studio back, our full budget,  our health insurance... 
 Pete, I'm not... 
They shut down your secret bathroom  to save on cleaning costs. 
 I have to talk to my husband. 
No, no, Bob, we made it very clear. 
You have to buy NBC with everything else. 
Then just don't watch it. 
What is it, Lemon? 
I'm trying to negotiate a $30 billion deal. 
That's billion with a "b." 
Is that right? 
That seems like way too much. 
Yeah, well, my staff and I are also trying to do our jobs, but we can't without studio space or health insurance or those vegetable chips that I hate and I keep telling Kenneth not to get. 
Let me show you something, Lemon. 
This is our NBC priority pie chart. 
The big red part you can see is The Biggest Loser. 
The yellow slice, our number-two priority, Make It 1997 Again Through Science or Magic, and the little green part is everything else. 
Request denied. 
No. 
Request denial denied. 
You have to make TGS a priority. 
Your show netted $600 last year. 
 Your parents had to buy an ad. 
 I don't care. 
If I don't get what I deserve, I'm not signing those divorce papers. 
Are you blackmailing me? 
You should think very carefully about what you're doing right now. 
I am... 
Lots. 
Very well. 
We'll do this divorce the hard way. 
But I'm warning you. 
This isn't my first rodeo, Lemon. 
Well, I've been to a rodeo too. 
It was a cat rodeo in a gay guy's apartment. 
Hey! 
What happened to my poster of the Montreal Alouettes? 
It's signed by Marc Trestman. 
Oh, it's tacky, Danny, just like your mother's stupid chain emails. 
Oh, here we go. 
Oh, my nails are wet! 
Mr. Hornberger... 
Do you and your wife ever fight? 
Not all the time. 
After her hysterectomy, she was in a coma briefly. 
How do y'all make up? 
Ah. 
Look, Paula and I love each other, but two people living together, it's unnatural. 
And while our children are basically snot silos with bb guns, they do come in handy as a buffer. 
Is that like being a fluffer? 
Because I have done that and did not enjoy it. 
Blow-drying animals at a pet salon is hard work. 
No, a buffer is a protective barrier. 
Like pigs have around their delicious testicle meat. 
We can't fight around the kids. 
You see them looking up at you with their little faces, their hair already receding, and you bite your tongue. 
A buffer. 
What is it? 
Thanks, Jack, for coming to this emergency meeting. 
I'm sorry I'm four hours late, but my alarm clock didn't go off because it died in a cockfight last night. 
Tracy, what can I do for you? 
Well, it's come to my attention that I'm going to die. 
Oh, please, you have nothing to worry about. 
We have Martin Lawrence on a holding deal. 
Look, I don't want anything to happen to my husband. 
But if it did, we have a lot of expenses. 
Estate planning is complicated, what, with the government taking half. 
What? 
That's double taxation. 
I like you, Angie. 
How can I help? 
Well, to maintain our standard of living, I need to be able to earn as much as Tracy does. 
And if you need to make millions of dollars but have no real skills or education, the best place to do it is in entertainment. 
I mean, look at me. 
I can't even find Mexico on a map. 
Things are a little tight at the company right now, but if you want to learn about the entertainment business, I can find you something. 
Oh, yeah, I'm willing to start at the bottom. 
There's only one thing I won't do, and that's take orders from anyone, ever. 
Hey, Angie, what are you doing? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm not about to cancel my hair appointment with D'Fwan because I'm your new intern. 
You need to light some incense in here. 
Okay, hang on. 
Who said you're my intern? 
It was Jack's idea. 
I have to start a career. 
But I'm gonna need next week off to go skiing. 
What? 
Okay, I see what this is. 
Jack's messing with me. 
We're having a little fight,  so he sent you here... 
 Excuse me. 
How is my being here messing with you? 
Do you have a problem with strong black women? 
No! 
Don't you see? 
That's the kind of exchange Jack wants. 
Angie, an intern's job is to do things like make copies and run errands. 
So I'm like your servant? 
No, because you're not being paid. 
You're really more like... 
Oh, boy. 
Look, Angie, you don't want to be an intern. 
Don't tell me what I want. 
And I don't really have time to mentor someone right now, so I don't think this is a good idea. 
I don't understand. 
That white girl just fired you. 
Come on, D'Fwan, be a buddy. 
Hey. 
Idiot, don't touch the... 
Nothing. 
Love you. 
Look, I made this picture of us. 
Did you draw that? 
You might need help. 
That's awful for an adult. 
Well, I think it's great, Kenneth. 
You should hang it on the wall. 
Careful! 
Don't coddle the boy. 
He can do it. 
Aah! 
Oh, my bones! 
 Now look what you did. 
 You made him afraid. 
Oh, did I also make you half a man? 
 You're ruining my life! 
 What life? 
My bones. 
Lemon, why do I have an appointment with Jeffrey Weinerslav tomorrow morning? 
Every day that I'm married to you, my life gets worse. 
That Angie thing was real cute, Jack. 
And some of your plan worked. 
Yes, she hated me, and, yes, I mentioned slavery by mistake. 
I knew I could count on you. 
But you also made me her boss, so I fired her. 
She chased me around for a while, so I hid in a closet down on news, but then Subhas and Ann Curry came in, just going to town on ea... 
 Damn it! 
 Is this a game for you two? 
I thought you were trying to help my family. 
My family! 
I'm not a pawn. 
I am a queen. 
You all are trash. 
And you know what Angie Jordan does with the trash? 
She drags it out to the curb for pickup. 
Angie, I did not mean... 
 I will rip your weave out. 
 It's not a weave! 
 Oh, good God, Angie, no. 
 Ow! She pulled my hair out. 
I should never have made you an intern. 
 You're a star. 
 That's right. I am. 
Entertainment is where untalented people go to get rich, and you have all the makings of a reality superstar... 
hair pullingness, delusions of grandeur, an insanely short fuse,  catchphrases... 
 It's my way till payday. 
That's the t-shirt. 
I should give you your own reality show, Friday nights... 
11:00. 
What? That is when TGS 
or wrestling is on. 
I guess I could reconsider the time slot in exchange for your signature. 
Ugh. 
You know what? 
I'm calling your bluff. 
You're not giving her a TV show. 
FYI, I am friends with a hilarious fat girl and a crazy-eyed, divorced white lady who wants to be in the music business. 
Oh, I'd watch that. 
 Can D'Fwan be on it? 
 Mmhmm. 
With his even gayer boyfriend. 
Okay, fine. 
Give her her own show, and I will watch it on our TV in our house, because I'm not signing anything. 
This is not over. 
You think my meth-addict nephew should be on the show? 
Yes, please! 
Pete, you and Paula fight a lot. 
No, I-I walked into a door. 
I'm so clumsy. 
Jack is using TGS as leverage in our divorce. 
He says he's gonna replace us with a reality show about Angie. 
 Oh, I'd watch that. 
 Obviously. 
But how do I fight back? 
Well, first off, you can't back down. 
If you do that, we get nothing. 
I agreed to go to a furniture store instead of watching football one time, and I haven't seen a game since. 
Oh, I hear ya. 
I mean, take Danny... 
Please. 
Then you got to hit them where it hurts. 
Find their weakness and viciously exploit it. 
That's what marriage is. 
Don't even get me started on marriage. 
Thank you. 
Kenneth, your Danny has something to tell you. 
What is it, Danny? 
Well, sport, I'm gonna be moving out. 
I don't understand. 
Well, sometimes two people who care about each other just can't live together. 
Oh, no, I get that. 
What I don't get is this is Danny's dressing room. 
I'm gonna be staying at the "y." 
It's that dark place under the bleachers that's shaped like a wishbone. 
But you're my Danny and Jenna. 
And we'll always be Danny and Jenna. 
We just won't be Danny and Jenna together. 
And don't think for one second this means we love you less. 
Know that it means that. 
Well, tell the board we are currently in talks... 
Hold on, please. 
Jonathan, I have asked you not to call me at home after 11:00... 
Or before. 
She what? 
My husband and I are absolutely so pleased to be underwriting the Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, the Arts, and Feelings. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 As embarrassed Americans, Jack and I pledge $5 million to create a new generation of choreographers and puppeteers, clunes, video artists, and theatrical jugglers who will ask the world, "what is art?" 
We know what art is. 
It's paintings of horses! 
Good morning. 
How is the happy couple today? 
Well, it's no surprise we're sitting here. 
You two have always thrown off that "will they or won't they?" vibe. 
And it's been a real hoot to watch your courtship. 
Okeydokey. 
Now, when two employees get married, it is my job to make sure that the employee is not receiving favoritism from his or her boss. 
Favoritism? Really? 
He's trying to cancel my show. 
Uh-huh, and what about your little announcement last night? 
Do you know how many fires I had to put out this morning because of you? 
And what was that voice? 
It is my imitation of Drew Barrymore's impression of that crazy lady. 
Let's keep this meeting short. 
Our marriage is a technicality, and it will be remedied. 
Also, in order for there to be favoritism, we'd have to actually still be friends. 
All righty. 
Let's just dive on in. 
Does the employee spend an inordinate amount of time in the employer's office compared to other employees? 
Well, yes, I suppose, but only because Miss Lemon is incapable of doing anything on her own. 
Oh, please, half the time when I go up there, it's to help you choose a tie, and they're all red or blue. 
Where I come from, if you have more than two colors on a tie, it means you're looking for a certain kind of bar. 
Are all workday conversations business-related, or do personal issues often dominate discussion, including but not limited to, mothers, diarrhea, having babies, problems in the bedroom, neckties, food issues, foot disorders,  having it all... 
 Okay. 
Yes. In the past, 
we have advised each other. 
For instance, Jack taught me not to wear tan slacks with a tan turtleneck. 
I thought it looked nice, but he rightly pointed out that it made me look like a giant condom. 
And Lemon is the only one of my subordinates who's not afraid to warn me when I'm being too authoritative or handsome. 
Or when you have eye boogers. 
Have you spent time with each other's families? 
Have you attended special events together, such as class reunions, birthday or holiday celebrations, weddings, or extended car trips? 
Are you each other's emergency contacts? 
Do you ever drink together at work, perhaps while summarizing what you've learned over the day or week? 
Have you shared intimate details of your fears, hopes, and dreams, both personal and professional? 
Is this the longest and perhaps most meaningful relationship in your life? 
Do you often find yourselves thinking the same thing and then saying it at the exact same time? 
 I apologize, Lemon. 
 I'm sorry, Jack. 
I never should have tried to blackmail you. 
I'll sign the papers. 
And I shouldn't have threatened your show. 
I'll leave that to the parental decency groups. 
And I'll back off on the budget and the bat mitzvahs. 
Okay. 
Now we're gonna do word association. 
Foreplay... 
We're done, Weinerslav. 
Uh, try to walk like a woman, Lemon. 
Your fly's open, Jack. 
I'm Angie. 
I think elegance and attitude are the same thing. 
And I have IBS. 
I'm D'Fwan and I just want to be accepted for who I am: a sexual maniac. 
And I'm Portia. I don't care 
what anyone says. 
I keep the 3D glasses. 
I'm Randi, with an "i". 
My ex-husband's new girlfriend is cheating on him...With me. 
Do you have any meth? 
Or meth? 
It's my way till payday. 
 Lemon, it's Jack. 
 Who's Jackie? 
Oh, Lemon, Avery and I just got back from the most amazing vacation on Paul Allen's yacht. 
And for four glorious weeks, my naturally blonde lady love and I basked in the three "s"s... 
surf, sun, and... 
Sandwiches? 
Heh, we didn't need sandwiches, Lemon. 
It was so warm you could pick fully cooked lobsters out of the water. 
Sheer bliss. 
Avery is the most perfect woman ever created. 
Like a young bo Derek stuffed with a Barry goldwater. 
You sound weird. 
Do you have a beard? 
Not for long. 
It's back to reality. 
No more making love on the beach surrounded by a privacy circle of English-trained butlers. 
But I've got to get out of island mode and back into work mode. 
How was your summer? 
Get this, my gynecologist committed suicide. 
And I'm back! 
Carol! 
Hey, Lizzie, I'm about to take off. 
I'm in lambert, St. Louis, 
and I can see the arch from here. 
No, wait, actually that's a half-burned-down McDonald's. 
Anyway, weather's great, and I just have to go St. Louis-Newark, 
Newark-Atlantic city, Atlantic city to Newark, and then I'll be there. 
Who flies Newark to Atlantic city? 
Black bachelorette parties. 
Gotta go. 
Hello? 
Yo, I'm calling to say that I'm giving you 110% this year. 
I'm relaxed, I'm focused, and I'm gonna be churning out the good stuff like you've never seen. 
That's great, Tracy. 
Oh, I misdialed. 
I thought I was calling my nutritionist. 
Good-bye. 
Okay, season five. 
Here we go. 
What about office supplies? 
Can you come down 5% there? 
I'll try. 
We're already printing all of our internal memos on the back of my kids' art. 
In order for this merger to stay attractive to our friends at Kabletown, we have to seem like a sexy, profitable company. 
And we're almost pulling it off. 
The Harry Potter theme park is a huge hit with both anglophiles and pedophiles. 
The movie division has a James Cameron movie the whole world will see, whether they like it or not. 
Only NBC continues to be the engorged whitehead on the otherwise flawless face of universal media. 
Lemon, why are you spending so much money on wigs? 
Tracy's head size keeps changing. 
Hang on, what is this pay increase for Jenna? 
Oh, boy. 
Look, as we enter the fifth season of TGS... 
and remember, no one ever thought we'd make it this far... 
I believed in us. 
That was actually an oversight. 
Jenna has some crazy stuff built into her contract that kicks in now. 
Like what? 
Eye contact. 
"Everyone must make eye contact with Miss Maroney at all times." 
She also gets a producer credit. 
What? 
Oh, it's just a vanity credit, Lemon. 
A low-cost way to make someone feel more important. 
Like executive producer Ashton Kutcher, or secretary of state Hillary Clinton. 
Am I late for the producers meeting? 
Eye contact. 
Thank you. 
 Hey, kkkk. 
First day back's gonna be a busy one. 
First, I need you to go to the dry cleaners for me and find out how martinizing works. 
I've always been curious. 
Then I need you to be back by noon to make the bathroom smell like sandalwood before I wreck it. 
You got that, k-pax-o-gum? 
I'm not Kenneth, sir. 
My name's Brian. 
Kenneth got fired at the end of last season. 
Of course. 
I knew that. 
Good meeting. 
 So how are things with Carol? 
 Good. 
Did you know that if you're a pilot, that chili's will seat you right away, even if the pilot's dinner companion has just been yelling at the hostess? 
You are the Jackie o of our time. 
And pilots get all these travel points at Starwind hotels. 
The one in midtown has free Internet. 
He doesn't stay with you when he's here? 
Why would he? 
Those Starwinds are nice! 
I mean, the bathtubs are so much cleaner than at home. 
It's almost as bad as "climax." 
You can't just do the vacation part. 
At some point you have to go home to the same house, unpack your dirty laundry, and have a life together. 
Then one of you says, "we should redecorate." 
And the other one says, "please, Avery, I'm using the commode right now." 
Ooh, she wants to redecorate? 
She just moved in. 
Avery, uh, has opinions. 
I love her for that. 
Unfortunately, she wants to repaint the upstairs hallway in a strie faux finish called "husk." 
I prefer the color that's already there... 
a reddish-brown shade called "elk tongue." 
So tell her no. 
It's your house. 
This is how I know you've never had an adult relationship. 
If I say no, then I will be required to say yes to something else in the future, and the stakes in the future might be higher. 
 Then say yes. 
 If I give in, then I'm no longer the Alpha in my house. 
Before you know it, she'll have me wearing jeans and reading fiction! 
Yeah, well, yes and no are kind of your only two choices. 
For most men, sure. 
But there is a third option. 
The Fabian strategy. 
I know this. 
If an apple and a feather fall at the same time... 
the Fabian strategy derives its name from the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus. 
He ran away, Lemon. 
Rather than engage in battle, he would retreat and retreat until the enemy grew fatigued and eventually made a mistake. 
Although I abhor it as a military strategy, it is the basis for all of my, uh, personal relationships. 
So Avery is your enemy. 
That sounds healthy. 
You're in no position to judge. 
Meeting someone in a hotel room twice a month is not a relationship... 
just ask any hooker. 
Oh, stop saying "relationship"! 
I'm sorry, I was going to say "climax." 
Aah! 
A line item budget. 
Oh, I love this. 
It takes people and turns them into amounts of money. 
Except for Tracy, I'm the most person on the show! 
At do we do now? 
Oh, okay, well, Jack wants me to keep the budget flat, but I don't want to deny people their raises. 
You should fire grace from wardrobe. 
She doesn't do anything. 
Fire grace? 
Come on, you'd have to be a heartless monster... 
I'll do it. 
Grace, your position has been terminated, effective immediately. 
But I've been here since the Jack Paar show. 
Your health insurance will remain in effect until the end of this sentence. 
Come on. Chop chop. 
What a shank job. 
Kenneth, I knew you'd come back! 
Let me smell your head. 
Mmm... 
Come on! 
This is a woman's blazer from a very expensive blazer shop called Rico's. 
I'm sorry, but my heart is playing tricks on my eyes. 
Just like my kidneys did to my lungs that time. 
Are you okay? 
I keep hallucinating Kenneth. 
Am I going crazy again? 
Should I get my rainbow wig out of storage? 
No, Tracy, it's normal. 
Kenneth was very special to you, and now he's gone. 
The next time you hallucinate, just tell yourself, "this is not real. 
I am in control of this." 
Like the world cup. 
I'll try. 
  No, this place is too full of memories. 
I gotta clear my head. 
Okay, well, we've only been back to work, like, an hour... 
And bye. 
Liz, get in on this. 
Would you rather have to start every sentence you say for the rest of your life with Urkel's catchphrase, "Did I do that?" 
Or be siamese twins with Sharon Stone for a year? 
Did I do that? 
Carol! 
So, Carol, you ever join the mile high club? 
Try five miles high. 
And no, I have not. 
Did you ever see a UFO up there? 
No, but once, when I was in the air force, I saw Mr. t in a pizza hut. 
Was the air force like top gun? 
Yeah, but with a lot more volleyball. 
You ever kill anyone? 
Sucked a mechanic into my engine once. 
Are you on Facebook? 
And these are for you. 
Passenger left them in the first-class lavatory. 
Ooh. 
Hey, I couldn't get a room at any of the Starwinds this weekend. 
You think it'd be all right if I stayed at your place? 
Uh... uh, yeah. Of course. 
I'll just have to run home first and take some plates out of the bathroom. 
But it would be nice staying together at your place, right? 
Yeah, it'll be a fun... 
Step for us. 
I just can't believe that every Starwind suite in the city is taken. 
Me neither. The lady said 
they're all booked up for something called jackfest. 
How many rooms did you book? 
It's for your own good, Lemon. 
I just want you to have what Avery and I have. 
I am a grown woman. 
I have been doing things my way for a long time. 
I don't like my life stuff mixing with my dude stuff. 
 A middleaged woman saying "dude stuff"... 
is that on my sadness scavenger hunt? 
Why, yes, it is. 
Carol and I enjoy our separate-but-intersecting lifestyles. 
It's perfect. 
I'm like that woman on the food network whose husband only comes home on the weekends, and she spends the rest of her time eating and drinking with her gay friends. 
Her name is the Barefoot Contessa, Lemon, and you will never be like her, starting with the barefoot part. 
I'll have you know that I wore sandals this summer, over socks...In a dream. 
Welcome to the late show with David letterman. 
Please have your tickets out. 
And now, as with all studio audiences, we will sort you according to attractiveness. 
Front, front, back, balcony, front, front... 
Mr. Jordan! 
No, you do not exist! 
I'm in control of this! 
Want to watch TV? 
First thing you need is tequila... 
Stop. Wait. No. 
The Barefoot Contessa... 
I love this show. 
Me too. 
This is one of the three things in the world I like... 
Ina Garten, sweater weather, and... 
When Muppets present at award shows? 
 Wow, yes! 
 Me too. 
We really see eye to eye on a lot of stuff, don't we? 
Absolutely. I've never 
met anyone before who had the exact same idea as me about what to do with Palestine. 
 It would work, right? 
 Of course it would work. 
And don't you agree that our situation is perfect right now? 
We have these great visits together, but then we still have our separate lives. 
We're like Jeffrey and Ina. 
No, no, I can't... 
I can't live like this anymore. 
I'm not like Jeffrey Garten. 
I'm not as strong as that guy! 
Don't have too much fun without me, okay? 
I need to know where this relationship is going, and I can feel you resisting it. 
No, no... 
It okay. 
Don't be cry. 
I'm a pilot, Liz. 
You know, I've spent my entire adult life... 
just casual girlfriends in different cities. 
I... I can't go from woman 
to woman to woman anymore. 
How many women have you been with? 
I'd rather not say. 
It's shameful. 
I mean, I'm a pit. 
Six. 
Oh, that's not so great. 
 I want grownup love! 
 Hello? 
 Thanks. 
Carol had a complete meltdown about the state of our relationship. 
I can't believe I tried to clean my bathtub for this. 
No, this is healthy, Lemon. 
Where is Carol now? 
I finally got him to sleep. 
I had to spoon him for, like, an hour. 
And I was the outer spoon. 
Welcome to adulthood. 
As for me, I have successfully retreated for another day. 
When Avery got home from work, I noticed that she had some paint samples in her purse, so I immediately asked her if her sister had done anything crazy lately, and guess what...She had. 
Avery talked about that for about an hour, her anger eventually transforming into some rather interesting sex. 
And now she's sleeping peacefully while Fabius has retreated to his den, where he is drinking scotch and playing snood. 
 Uhhuh. Does Avery's work 
email go right to her phone? 
 Why? 
 Nothing. 
Just sending her a link to this cool site... 
funkyvintagewallpaper.com. 
Lemon, don't! She keeps 
her blackberry in bed with her. 
 And send. 
 Damn it, Lemon! 
It has to be elk tongue! 
Oh... 
Eww... No! 
This Jenna promotion is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. 
Do you understand how much free time I have now? 
Yesterday, I went to the gym. 
And this morning, I made love to my wife. 
And she was still asleep, so I didn't have to be gentle. 
That's one of the most upsetting things I have ever imagined. 
Are you sure? 
Think about it again. 
Yes. 
Liz, the writers can't take a car service at night anymore. 
I've crunched the numbers, and it's cheaper for us to just replace anyone who gets murdered. 
So did Avery like my wallpaper idea? 
 She did. Heh heh. 
 Huh...So why are you happy? 
Because the Fabian strategy is working. 
Every new pattern Avery showed me, I would simply say, "yes, I like that one too." 
And she was so overwhelmed with the choices that she made a mistake. 
She suggested that we consult her old college friend, who's an interior designer. 
 Uhhuh. 
He's coming here to meet with me today. 
His name is James. 
Not Jim, not Jimmy... 
Jamessss. 
I get it. 
She's sending her army into unknown territory. 
And I am flanking her... 
With these. 
Have you seen my eyes, Lemon? 
Yep. 
They're very blue. 
Like a mikonos sky. 
Mark Foley once called them "piercing." 
Hmm. 
Avery has really made a misstep here. 
Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? 
There's a term for it. 
I'm a bear...And I'm a 
I'm a daddy bear. 
Just one hour of flirty chatting with James, and you know what I'll get. 
Not a Glaad award, I know that. 
Elk tongue. 
Well, I'm glad to hear that you've almost vanquished your girlfriend. 
Thank you. 
And you versus Carol... 
how's that going? 
I don't know. We had 
a pretty emotional breakfast. 
He says he's leaving early now. 
I don't know what to do. 
I know it's difficult, Lemon. 
But now you have an adult decision to make. 
Would you rather let go of your precious autonomy, and let Carol into your life? 
Or would you rather teach your cat to dial 911? 
First of all, I'm tired of playing "would you rather." 
And second of all, you know that I have life alert. 
Oh, I pushed it. 
I need a phone. 
Mr. Jordan. 
Mr. Jordan, please stop. 
You're not real. 
If I threw you in front of a car, it would drive right through you! 
No! No...Sir! 
I am real! 
Would an imaginary me know that you have a mole on your list of pets to get? 
Or that your favorite color is rainbow? 
Of course it would. 
It would know anything I knew because it sprung from my imagination. 
Sir, it's really me! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, no, I missed it! 
Do it again! 
I love you, Ken-word. 
Why don't you come back home to TGS and pick the peas out of my fried rice? 
And the rice. 
I just want carrots. 
I can't do that, sir. 
But don't you miss rubbing my foot back into the shape of a foot? 
Of course I do. 
But I'm real happy here at CBS. 
They gave me a tote bag with the mentalist on it! 
 I guess this is goodbye. 
Obviously, I'm going to need the tote bag. 
James, tell me, which one of these do you like? 
Because with my untrained eyes, the strie is bland, and the, uh... 
Wallpaper just looks busy. 
Oh...I don't know. 
Do you see something, uh, here that you like? 
It's so frustrating. 
  I think I found a way to get the budget down to where Jack wants it. 
That's my girl! 
You are en fuego. 
I was looking it over, and I've realized something. 
There's one too many producers, Pete. 
Okay, I get it. 
But please... 
I have five kids... 
That I don't want to be at home with. 
No, Pete, it's me. 
As great as I am at this, I'm not really necessary. 
Hmm, the last time I said that, I was in a three-way with two of the backstreet boys. 
No, Jenna, you can't quit. 
I'll take a pay cut. 
We can fire Liz! 
This is hard for me too, Pete. 
But it's because I'm a genius producer I know that you have to fire me. 
Take my producing fee and amortize it to cover the gaps in transport and electric. 
Hey, Liz, would you rather... 
 Oh... 
 Be with the person you love forever, but you always have to wear a shirt made out of their pubes, or be alone for the rest of your life, but you get to wear whatever you want? 
Shirt of pubes. 
I thought you left. 
I came back. 
I mean, I had to kick an obese teen off the flight to get a seat, but I really wanted to talk to you. 
Look, I'm not sorry you saw me cry. 
I'm an emotional guy. 
That's actually not even part of my personality. 
That's just something that happens to people who change altitude more than four times a day. 
Is that also why you got so mad watching the giants game? 
No, that was because why does Geico have three different spokespeople? 
They have the caveman, the lizard, and then the stack of money with the eyeballs. 
And the fake Rod Serling guy. 
Oh, my God, right. 
Thank you. 
I mean, you see how good we are together? 
Look, Liz, I want this. 
But if we're gonna go for it, we gotta move forward a bit with each visit. 
Two minutes to air. 
Cast, please set yourselves. 
Look, you have to get back to the airport, I have a show. 
How do we move this forward in the time allotted? 
All right, let's each say one thing about ourselves that the other person doesn't know on the count of three, all right? 
Ready? One, two, three. 
I'm on a waiting list to adopt a kid. 
Touched by a priest... 
it's fine. 
Wait, what? 
Okay... 
That was a step. 
Yeah. 
See you October 14. 
Cast for "would you rather" set yourselves, please. 
I never thought you'd make it this far, Lemon. 
I know, season five... We were 
supposed to get cancelled. 
Not just the show, I mean you. 
You're in an "adult dude" situation. 
You're wearing a beautiful blazer from Rico's husky-boy collection... 
Is that what ragazzi robusti means? 
I'm just saying I'm happy for you. 
Thank you, Jack. 
And I'm glad that you're getting to keep your wall "elk tongue." 
Actually, no. 
The fabulous James and I came up with an excellent idea. 
We're taking that wall down. 
That way we can make the master bedroom closet bigger and gain a nice architectural symmetry. 
Huh. You think maybe that's 
what Avery wanted all along? 
Oh, my God. 
Hannibal defeated Fabian with a decoy army. 
James was a plant. 
The strie wall finish was a decoy. 
She hannibaled my Fabian! 
Lemon, Avery and I are perfect together. 
Like...Whiskey and hunting. 
"Soul mate" doesn't even begin to do it justice. 
She's my... 
She's your pube shirt. 
Pube shirt. 
That's our show. 
Good night. 
Good night, Miss Maroney. 
Good night, Mr. Jordan. 
Good night, TGS band, with your funny-smelling dressing room. 
Good night, bear! 
Good night moon...Soon park 
from accounting. 
Good night, Miss Lemon. 
Good night, Mr. Donaghy. 
I lied to Mr. Jordan. 
I miss you all so much. 
Sir? 
Is it really you? 
Sure is. 
Wanna go kiss in the prop cage? 
What? No! 
﻿1 Wonderful news, non-famouses. 
My publicist just called from rehab. 
I made the internet. 
You're on joanofsnark.com? 
 On what? 
 Joanofsnark. 
It's this really cool feminist web site where women talk about how far we've come and which celebrities have the worst beach bodies. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg! 
"Comedy's freshest female voice." 
Take that, Courtney Thorne-Smith. 
That's not about you. 
That's about some stand-up named Abby Flynn. 
 Wow. 
 Lady. 
Pretty nostrils. 
How do I find me? 
Computer, "Jenna"! 
Oh, here's your article. 
"Why does 'TGS' hate women?" 
What? 
How can they say that? 
We love women. 
With Tracy gone, our last episode was all Jenna. 
This is Amelia Earhart. 
I'm almost across the Pacific... 
Oh, no. 
My period! 
I'll now take questions. 
Oh, no. 
My period! 
Let's nuke England! 
But that is an ironic reappropriation. 
I don't know anymore. 
This started as a show for women, starring women. 
At the very least, we should be elevating the way women are perceived in society. 
Oh, my period! 
You're all fired! 
Jack. 
Do you think I hate women? 
Absolutely. 
But it's not your fault. 
You are genetically predisposed to compete against other women for the attention of strong, powerful men like myself or others very similar to me. 
For example, Hercules, the highlander, or, uh...God. 
I want to roll my eyes right now, but the doctor said if I keep doing it my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs. 
Female jealousy is an evolutionary fact, Lemon. 
If you try to breed it out of them, you end up with a lesbian with hip dysplasia. 
You're wrong. 
I support women. 
I'm like a human bra, which is why I want to hire a young comic named Abby Flynn to come on as a guest writer. 
No, you are not budgeted... 
She's got good energy. 
Hire her immediately. 
See? 
I'm not threatened by the fact that men are attracted to her. 
Please, Lemon. 
It's got nothing to do with her hot mouth. 
Every organization needs new blood once in a while. 
Like Hank Hooper says in his book, "New blood is the lifeblood of every company's blood." 
He's not a strong writer. 
Hank Hooper. 
Isn't that the guy who outbid no one for NBC? 
Yes, he's the CEO of Kabletown, but he won't be forever. 
And someday, when he steps down, I intend to succeed him. 
Well, believe in yourself and you will reach your goals. 
I read that on a bottle of women's exercise water. 
Ah, it's not so simple. 
Kabletown is a family-owned company. 
There is a potential successor, so to get what I want, I must find a way to destroy her. 
Her? 
It's a woman? 
Well, not exactly. 
Hi, I'm Kaylie Hooper. 
I'm 14 years old and I'm waiting in line to meet Justin Bieber 'cause he's... 
I'm sorry. 
Your new rival is a ninth grade girl? 
How old is Hank's wife? 
Is it a second marriage? 
Why do men always marry someone younger? 
"Because they can, Liz." 
Get a grip, Lemon. 
Kaylie is Hank Hooper's granddaughter. 
Her parents' generation was lost to "trust fund kids" disease. 
The aunt smokes pot and "paints." 
The father is trying to sail an inflatable castle across the Atlantic. 
I have to ensure that Kaylie makes similar choices. 
So you're trying to destroy a 14-year-old? 
I am trying to guide a 14-year-old. 
Maybe I could help her realize some other life goal. 
To become a doctor's nurse or a lawyer's mistress or even the president of the United States Shopping Association. 
Wow. 
Typical. 
Meanwhile, I'm helping women achieve their potential. 
Because potential is the difference between what you can't do and what can't you do. 
Did you get that off of a water bottle? 
No, I sent it in, but Aquafem did not choose it. 
Okay. 
Word is this Abby Flynn thing is really happening. 
Girl coming! 
This is a big opportunity for us. 
She does not know how much we suck. 
But she'll find out soon enough. 
I mean, how long did it take the women here? 
I don't know. 
How long does it take to see something? 
I mean, light travels at 186,000 miles per second, so... 
No duh! 
Being ourselves doesn't work. 
So to have a chance with Abby, we're creating new identities. 
I'm going to be pretend to be rich. 
And I'll be a dangerous bad boy. 
And I shall be British. 
'Cause chicks dig British guys. 
Sir Ian McKellen? 
That dude must be knee-deep in boob. 
And if you guys don't go along with this, Lutz will play Xbox Kinect with his shirt off again. 
Star jump! 
I found the chrysalis! 
Rich, bad boy, British. 
Got it. 
 Nice! 
 All right! 
 Yeah! 
 Hey, yeah! 
Now, you may have heard of J. Fred Muggs, 
the chimpanzee that was on The Today Showin the '50s. 
But what most people don't know is that NBC is still a network. 
Speaking of television, is that a field you would like to go into, Kaylie? 
Work with your grandfather? 
Mmm. 
I agree. 
TV is boring. 
So do you have a favorite subject in school, Kaylie? 
You don't want to hear about school. 
It's dumb. 
What you talkin' 'bout, Kaylie? 
School's cool. 
Just like Justin "Bee-eye-bear." 
Well, I've never told anyone in my family this before, but my dream is to be a marine biologist. 
My favorite fish is the cleaner wrasse and I even tried to get it chosen as our school mascot, but, well, I was outvoted. 
So our new mascot is a slut. 
So you're interested in marine biology. 
Hmm. 
Who do I know? 
You've probably never heard of the explorer Bob Ballard. 
You know Dr. Ballard? 
He discovered the Titanic, the Lusitania, and according to his website, a guilt-free cheesecake recipe. 
I'm also on the board of the American Museum of Natural History. 
Ah! 
If you like, I could have Dr. Ballard 
give us a private tour of the museum. 
Oh, my gosh! 
Mr. Donaghy, 
that'd be so cool! 
Okay, now, please follow me to Brian Williams' bathroom, which is also J. Fred Muggs' skull. 
Okay, guys, Abby is on her way up. 
West Ham drew nil-nil at wolves? 
Stop that! 
Are you guys changing your personalities for Abby? 
Is she here yet? 
Subhas, you are married. 
Okay, this is exactly the kind of male douchebaggery that is about to take a real hit around here. 
Don't you know I'm talkin' 'bout a femolution? 
Tracy Chapman. 
She's a woman, right? 
It's a new era at "TGS." 
Let's see the blogosphere try to say that I hate women now. 
Look at all these dudes! 
I knew I smelled sausage. 
Yes! 
Abby? 
I'm Liz. 
Liz! 
Thank you! 
Oh! 
Our nips just touched. 
Mine are so hard. 
Mine are different sizes. 
Abby, these are the writers. 
Oh, where's little Abby gonna sit? 
Guess I'll have to sit on somebody's lap. 
You could sit there. 
 Eenie... 
 Please God. 
 Meenie... 
 Come to mommy. 
 Minie... 
 Me. Pick me. 
Moe! 
Give me strength, oh, Oprah. 
When I first started working here, an eight-year-old Shirley Temple taught me how to roll a cigarette. 
Lemon, who thinks gesturing with one's thumbs is for poor people and is going to be the next CEO of Kabletown? 
This guy. 
Already? 
What did you do to her? 
Nothing. 
She wants to be a marine biologist. 
Kaylie is playing right into my hands. 
I also had a youthful fascination with exploration and I know exactly what any 14-year-old science geek wants to do. 
Practice frottage on a poster of Linda Ronstadt and meet your idol. 
Like when I met Jacques Cousteau. 
I will never forget what he said to me. 
Oh, I did forget. 
It was so long ago. 
When I was a kid, I got to meet the "where's the beef" lady. 
With my connections, I can make Kaylie's dreams come true. 
I should dig up my old shell collection and give it to her. 
Complete the seduction after Bob Ballard and I double-team her. 
Word choice, Jack. 
Withdrawn. 
Lemon, is that the new woman you hired? 
Is it cold in here or is it just that I'm not wearing any underwear? 
She should be careful around the crew. 
New York gives us a tax break for employing sex offenders. 
 It's a terrible program. 
 What's that? 
Oh, I don't know. 
Is it a stain? 
Nobody knows. 
What is that? 
Ow. 
That is Abby Flynn. 
She's a guest writer. 
She's being hot and doing baby talk? 
I invented that. 
Summer of '98, I took it to a whole new level. 
There can't be two of us, Liz. 
She must be destroyed. 
Uh-huh. 
I don't know how I got here. 
No, Jenna. 
That is exactly the problem. 
Men infantilize women and women tear each other down. 
Exactly. 
I'll start by spreading a destructive rumor about her like the famous one I made up about Jamie Lee Curtis. 
That she has two butts. 
Look, you and I actually want the same thing, but we're not gonna destroy Abby. 
We're gonna fix her. 
Yes, like you fix a dog. 
We'll sterilize her. 
No, I'm gonna show Abby that she doesn't need to act like this. 
Hi. I'm Jack. 
It's nice to meet you. 
Hi. 
I'm Abby. Hi. 
Ugh. 
Whatever. 
So what do you think, Kaylie? 
Oceanography's a pretty cool life. 
I can't believe I'm talking to Dr. Robert Ballard. 
You're not. 
"Bob" is short for "Bobert." 
Oh. 
Oh, my gosh. 
An anglerfish. 
Lophius piscatorius. 
That was my favorite fish as a boy. 
Look at those teeth. 
You know that's a female. 
The male is much smaller and is basically a parasite that lives on her. 
Until mating, of course. 
Then the male dies. 
Yes, the scientific term for that is "marriage." 
Don't tell Gina I said that. 
The ocean really is the final frontier, Kaylie. 
And we keep finding new things. 
Giant tube worms that breathe hydrogen sulfide. 
Arctic jellyfish. 
Oh! 
And a chemical in kelp that scientists think might one day cure ice cream headaches. 
There's so much left to discover. 
And you could be the one to do it. 
I kind of envy you. 
Youngsters are the future of ocean exploration, Kaylie. 
I mean, I'm not gonna live forever, no matter how much gold I give Poseidon. 
That's why I'm making you a student argonaut. 
I can't believe this is happening! 
You already speak dolphin. 
Excellent. 
Is there an age cutoff for the student argonauts? 
What if you gave me a sticker as a joke? 
You know, Mr. Donaghy, 
it... 
It seems you really love this stuff. 
Maybe you should have been a deep-sea explorer. 
Oh, no, Kaylie. 
That was a boyhood fantasy. 
I'm an adult now. 
I don't have fantasies anymore. 
Kaylie, this way. 
There she is, men. 
The elusive northern right whale. 
 Oh blow the wind westerly   let the wind blow   oh derry hi derry   hey derry ho  Jack? 
Jack? 
Yes, sailor? 
What is it? 
We're moving on. 
Hey, Liz! 
Abby, thanks for meeting me here. 
This place is very special to me. 
Is this where you got your v-card punched? 
What? 
No. 
Does this look like the makeup room of a clown academy? 
No, this is a statue... 
and I know you know this... 
of Eleanor Roosevelt. 
First lady to the world, champion of the rights of women, and the lid on my high school lunch box. 
Look, I know it can be hard. 
Society puts a lot of pressure on us to act a certain way. 
But "TGS" is a safe place, so you can drop the sexy baby act and lose the pigtails... 
But I like my pigtails. 
My uncle says they're sexy. 
Enough with the gross jokes. 
And that voice! 
I want you to talk in your real voice. 
This is my real voice. 
And the whole sexy baby thing isn't an act. 
I'm a very sexy baby. 
I can't help it if men are attracted to me. 
Like that homeless guy. 
He likes what he sees. 
Okay. 
That could be for me. 
It's not! 
It's for her! 
 Abby, I'm trying to help you. 
 Really? 
By judging me on my appearance and the way I talk? 
And what's the difference between me using my sexuality and you using those glasses to look smart? 
 I am smart. 
I placed out of freshman German. 
Or Lutz using that sexy English accent to get me in the sack? 
No! You didn't! 
Lutz? 
Is that even possible? 
I mean, I was there when he belvedered. 
God, Abby, you can't be that desperate for male attention. 
You know what, Liz? 
I don't have to explain myself to you. 
My life is none of your business. 
Except it is because you represent my show and you represent my gender in this business and you embarrass me. 
Kiss! 
Dude, I am sorry, but this is who I am. 
Deal with it. 
Now are we gonna give the gentleman what he asked for or not? 
Ugh. 
Kenneth, when I'm gone, how do you think people will remember me? 
Actually, sir, I've already started to compose a heroic ballad commemorating your life. 
 Slaves of Jesus   hear my tale  I'll tell you what they'll say. 
"Hey, remember Jack Donaghy? 
"He wore a lot of suits and went to a lot of meetings. 
Now power down, conversation robot." 
Sounds like you're asking some pretty big questions. 
When I have problems, I like to talk to the man upstairs. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Guzelian 
got put in jail for attacking his father. 
I mean, what are we put on this earth to do? 
Sit behind a desk? 
I'm still young, Kenneth. 
I could devote the time I have left to other interests. 
Let Kaylie run Kabletown. 
I'll join Ballard's group and become a scientist-adventurer. 
Now, that... 
Would be a legacy. 
I hope my legacy is a Sesame Street type TV show that promotes illiteracy in girls. 
This could be me. 
"Remember Jack Donaghy? 
"He was the world's greatest oceanographer. 
"And we walruses owe him everything for giving us the gift of language." 
No. 
All right, your time is up, my friend. 
I'm taking control of this Abby situation. 
No, Jenna. 
I'm not done. 
Check this out. 
I'm thinking to myself, "whatever happened to the erasable pen?" 
Besides pencils, who's saying that's a bad idea? 
I've always thought that, but I never had the courage to say it. 
Is that Abby? 
I knew her boobs were fake. 
And that baby voice is fake too. 
You know, as someone who speaks very naturally, I'm offended. 
She's taken on a whole new identity. 
She changed her nose, her teeth. 
She even changed her name. 
It's not Abby Flynn. 
It's Abby Grossman. 
Well, that's understandable. 
I mean, "Grossman" is a little bagel-y. 
Abby used to be a strong, smart, beautiful woman. 
Why did she transform herself into that baby hooker? 
Oh. 
Children's book idea: Baby hooker. 
Don't tell Liz. 
Well, I am confronting Abby with this in front of everybody. 
Oh, that's vicious. 
Forget my idea. 
Yours is so elegant. 
No, Jenna, for the last time, we're helping her. 
Say no more. 
Gotcha, boss. 
Who else is on the call? 
Katherine Scott, sales. 
Andy Hoberman, web sales. 
Gil Coughlin, oversight. 
I've got everyone from meeting planning. 
Tricia, Maria, Greg, Greg P., Lyle, Edwin. 
This is Charles. 
I'm on for Douglas. 
No, Charles. 
I'm on, but I just dialed in. 
Mr. Donaghy. 
What are you doing here? 
I could ask you the same thing, but that would make no sense. 
Where did you get this picture of Cousteau? 
That? 
The Internet. 
This picture exists in only two places. 
The negative is in my personal safe along with my will and some beanie babies that I thought would be worth more. 
Or it could be found in the right book. 
Ugh! 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Quiet, chalk-hands. 
A real man is talking. 
Why do you have this, Kaylie? 
Why are you reading my autobiography? 
Well, uh... 
Same reason you're reading Pop-Pop's book. 
Researching the enemy. 
So it's true. 
I was trying to make you think you didn't want to run Kabletown, while you were doing the same thing to me. 
What a super sleuth. 
You're just like Vanessa from the "Vampire Detective Mysteries." 
I'm not familiar with that reference, but I assume that Vanessa is some kind of cool genius. 
You don't even like the ocean, do you? 
I hate the ocean. 
It's for tools. 
The ocean's awesome and for winners. 
You're for tools. 
You can't beat me, Mr. Donaghy! 
You worked your way into this world, but I... 
I was born into it. 
I breathe it. 
So watch your step. 
'Cause I can always tell Pop-Pop you gave me alcohol. 
And I can always seduce one of your teachers and get her to fail you. 
 I'd be into that. 
 Me too. 
Better pick up your books or you'll be late for class. 
This is my free period. 
Well played. 
Megan, books! 
You know what sucked about my last lesbian orgy? 
Right in the middle of it, one of us had to get up to go use the bathroom and then we all had to go! 
Okay, there's something everyone here needs to see. 
Abby, you might want to sit down for this. 
Yeah, come sit on my struikgewas. 
On a chair. 
Come on, Sue. 
Abby, this is for your own good. 
Open apple, tough love time. 
Has anyone ever actually had a good time at brunch? 
 You know... 
 Is that you? 
I don't know where you found that, but I am taking it down. 
That's what she said! 
Hey, first of all, Steve Carell owns "that's what she said." 
He owns it. 
And second of all, it's time to stop hiding. 
A young person helped me online post this on joanofsnark.com. 
You stupid, meddling bitch! 
Yes! 
There's your real voice. 
There's Abby Grossman. 
To quote Eleanor Roosevelt, "We are all..." 
Do you understand what you've done? 
You have signed my death warrant. 
How's that now? 
My ex-husband is gonna see this. 
He's gonna find out where I am and he is gonna try to run me over with his car again. 
I changed my appearance to get away from him! 
Oh, 'cause I thought it was, like, pressure from society. 
You're right, Liz. 
I was hiding from a man who went insane after being electrocuted while watching Sleeping with the Enemy. 
I was cut out of that. 
Oh, yeah, I am desperate for male attention, because I feel safer having men around in case Troy comes back. 
That is why I slept with Lutz. 
And I shall protect her. 
Is there an Abby Flynn here? 
That's her, Troy! 
I'm on your side! 
Get her! 
Geez, Lutz. 
It's the ups guy. 
Okay, I think we all owe Abby an apology. 
Oh, my God. 
It's from him. 
"I thought this box would be the perfect size "for your head. 
P.S. I was electrocuted again 
while watching Seven." 
Great. 
I have six hours to start a new life. 
I'll have to be a redhead this time. 
Oh, I don't know, with your coloring. 
You know what? 
Don't listen to me. 
You must really hate women, Liz. 
Liz Lemon is a Judas to all womankind! 
Okay. 
We were on page six... 
Where Wonder Woman... 
Gets her period. 
Tonight's tag is gonna be a nice wrap-up scene between Jack and Liz. 
After all, they spent the whole episode trying to help young women. 
But, first, I would like to correct some of the science we saw tonight. 
There is no oil in kelp that helps cure ice cream headaches. 
No, the only thing that will cure ice cream headaches is having sex on a motorcycle. 
Kailey was not speaking dolphin. 
When a dolphin expresses excitement it sounds like this. 
Okay, we got a lot of fun tonight and it's not over. 
In the time remaining we're gonna go to that Jack and Liz wrap up scene I promised you. 
Well, Lemon... 
Ten minutes. 
Ten minutes to air. 
Cast will be changing. 
Hey, you wanted to see me? 
Does it seem weird in here to you? 
Everything look like a Mexican soap opera. 
I don't know. 
Does it? 
God, I can see every line and pore on your face. 
It looks like a ymca climbing wall. 
My face cream was recalled. 
Apparently it was destroying the lab rats. 
What is that word? 
Brains. 
I just wanted to let you know that while Avery is pregnant, I am giving up drinking. 
She can't drink, I won't drink. 
Wow. 
I don't know this f that's a good idea for you. 
Remember what happened that time I tried to give up refined sugars? 
Hey, looking good, Liz. 
Our bodies, we don't want all that processed junk. 
I don't know if you've read Michael Pollan... 
Who wants donuts? 
I'll kill you! 
Why are you better-looking in your memory? 
My memory has Seinfeld money. 
Well, don't worry for me. 
Drinking has always been about the ritual. 
I just have to replace the ritual, and Avery got me this nice tea set, some knitting needles and yarn and a book on sleight-of-hand magic. 
Dah dah, dah, dah dah dah. 
That's as far as I've gotten. 
Okay. Well, if that's it, 
I'm going to go downstairs. 
Yeah, have a good show. 
I'm dreading watching it sober. 
Hey, Jack knows it's my birthday, right? 
Hmm, let me see. 
I have my master list of staff birthdays right here. 
Oh, no. 
I seem to have forgotten to put on it. 
Is this because of that joke I made the other day? 
Jonathan, give me a pen? 
Yeah, chai boy, get in here. 
You'll never be a millionaire. 
Ha-ha! 
"Slumdog millionaire". 
Slammo. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Whatever. 
Jack will remember my birthday because we're friends. 
Also, it's a pretty big birthday. 
Are you turning 1,000? 
Really, you want to play this game with a comedy writer? 
 Doo doo doo doo dah   live show it's the "30 rock" live show it's "30 rock" live   why, though, do a "30 rock" live show? 
Why "30 rock" live?  
 because this is my gift to you our audience!  
hi, jawed weeing. 
Hi, Jadwiga. 
Hello. 
I haven't seen you in a while. 
Brain move. 
Much hospital. 
I'm glad to see you back. 
Oh, you know, I wanted to let you know there's probably going to be some kind of a party later because it's my birthday. 
Oh. 
"Happy days" is my favorite show. 
Yes "happy days" it's a great show, but there might be a mess, and... 
Are we understanding each other? 
Yes, yes. 
I clean you now? 
No. 
You don't have to clean me. 
I'm just saying you may have to clean up after a surprise party later because it's my birthday, and it's a big one. 
Wah! 
What are we doing, Jadwiga? 
I like fonzi. 
Okay. 
Good talk, Jadwiga. 
Ah! 
Got your messages. 
A Mr. Brett Favre stopped by, and 
dropped off this picture of a hot dog. 
Finally. 
Oh, and the Chilean miners are all out, and they're angry about what you've been saying about them. 
I guess they're geniuses for getting stuck in a mine. 
Oh, also your pharmacy called, and apparently you can't get a prescription for ecstacy. 
Thanks, Obama care. 
If you need somebody to scream at, I'm right here. 
Hello, Ms. lemon. 
What's up, giggly? 
I don't know. 
Mr. Hornberger needs to see you many Mr. 
Jordan's dressing room right away. 
I wonder why. 
I don't know. 
You better find out. 
Surprise, Liz. 
Tracy has come up with a new way to ruin the show. 
What? 
No, no. 
I told you, your lizard cannot be the musical guest. 
Of course, not. 
His album doesn't drop until December. 
No, no, Liz. 
Last night for the first time ever Tracy watched the non-porn version of the "Carol Burnett show". 
It was funnier than the porn version, and the best part is when the actors started cracking up. 
They laughed so hard they couldn't even finish the skit. 
Your point is? 
I would like to do that, please. 
Do what? 
Crack up instead of saying these stupid lines I wrote. 
Stupid lines I wrote, and, no, we're not doing that. 
You never take my creative suggestions. 
The only her one I can remember is when you wanted me to hire those two strippers to dance behind you. 
You should have. 
Those dudes were awesome. 
So is my crack-up idea. 
Okay. 
Tracy, what are you talking about is called breaking, and, you know, sure, audiences love it when something goes wrong. 
We don't do that here. 
It's cheap, okay, so no breaking. 
Promise? 
I promise. 
I swear on my mother's grave. 
Did you say grave or grape? 
Yes, good-bye. 
Gentlemen, tonight I'm going to laugh harder than I did at Dotcom's play. 
It was "angels in America," trey. 
Oh, Ms. Lemon. 
Mr. Donaghy called. 
Why are you giggling like that? 
It's very misleading. 
I don't know. 
I'm sorry. 
It's just Mr. Lutz is wearing 
the most hilarious t-shirt, and every time I see it, well, just take a look. 
Ha! 
It's stupid. 
That guy is stupid. 
Now, she's stupid. 
Now they are. 
Now I were. 
Anyway, Mr. Donaghy called while 
you were in with Mr. Jordan. 
He needs to see you right away. 
Liz. 
I almost forgot. 
Happy Birthday. 
The song, legal says we can't use it in the sketch, but we can use "it's your b-day, bitch" by Snooki's mom. 
Did I just hear that correctly, because last year I wrote a song called "it's your birthday slut." 
Does her track sound anything like this? 
 You say that it's your birthday time to skank it up harrrd  Did you just nip that? 
I need a drink, Lemon. 
Oh, already? 
Okay. 
We can... 
It turns out it's not the ritual. 
According it a bunch of on-line questionnaires, I have a drinking problem. 
Oh, God. 
I have a splitting headache. 
Okay. 
Replace the ritual. 
Replace the ritual. 
Can you come over here, please? 
Finish the magic book? 
I cannot divulge my secrets. 
I don't want to let Avery down. 
But this is hard. 
Distract me, Lemon. 
Entertain me. 
Okay. 
Open on... 
The covent garden flower market! 
The year? 
1892! 
Flowers! 
Flowers for sale! 
Get out of here! 
Did he remember your birthday? 
Oh, come on. 
What's up, New York? 
Tracy Jordan in the house! 
You're the real stars! 
Not really! 
Fox news. 
A division of fox nonsense, incorporated. 
Welcome back to fox news. 
I'm blonde. 
President Obama, in your own words, why are you a terrorist that hates America? 
That's an excellent question. 
Uh-oh! 
I'm doing something called "breaking"! 
Bwah-ha-ha! 
Snort! 
Hee-hee! 
Giggle-giggle! 
The audience loves this. 
Oh, that idiot. 
Fine. 
Just go to commercial. 
Go to commercial. 
Erectile dysfunction. 
It's not just a dog problem anymore. 
It also affects millions of men. 
Hello. 
I'm "doctor" Leo spaceman. 
For too long, E.D. 
has been viewed as a physical problem. 
And it's been treated with pills and ointments and contraptions whose straps break all too easily. 
But couldn't the real cause of E.D. 
be that we haven't produced a good doing-it song since "close the door" by Teddy Pendergrass? 
That's why I recorded an album. 
 Baby, let's take it slow you know we got all night   light some candles draw a bath and start off with full-on intercourse!  
Guaranteed to end erectile dysfunction, these are the sweet sounds of "Dr. Leo spaceman's love storm: 
An ultra-strength "audio rebonulator." 
 Baby let's let the dog watch us do you think he understands the love that we have?  
 oops, I'm finished call yourself a cab  Hey, idiot! 
Liz, I know we're not usually the most grateful bunch, but everybody is signing this birthday card for Jadwiga, the cleaning lady. 
Wow. 
Jadwiga's birthday. 
Tracy! You should be 
ashamed of yourself. 
I can't be. 
I'm missing that part of my brain. 
Why are you doing this? 
Why does anybody do anything? 
They're rich or have attention deficit disorder. 
Look at Liz's shirt. 
You are ruining the show. 
No more laughing. 
All right. 
No more laughing. 
I promise. 
Krout's honor. 
Did you say scout or... 
Carol, I knew you wouldn't forget me today. 
No nonessential chatter, Liz. 
I am having the worst flight of my career. 
We good wind shears, lightning, severe turbulence. 
The in-flight meal was a frittata. 
Oh, my God. 
At night? 
Lizzie, if something were to happen, I want you to know that I... I need you to go to my 
apartment and just clear out all the porn before my mom gets there. 
That's it? 
Yeah. 
I also need you to TiVo "bones" for me in case I survive. 
You know what, Carol, today is a very special day, and you should have known that, and you should also than you can't use cell phones on planes. 
No, that's just something we tell passengers. 
I think I just screwed up something with my girlfriend. 
You know, I have always loved you. 
Not now, Kevin. 
Copy that. 
Liz, how could you let Tracy do that to me? 
I am a professional, Liz. 
I have never broken during a performance, ever. 
I was on stage in "pippin" with Irene Ryan when she died, and I kept on going. 
That is why you are so amazing. 
I will never break, Liz. 
But if he pulls that stunt again, I will have a wardrobe malfunction. 
I will slip a nip, Liz. 
So help me, I will slip a nip. 
Hi, Jadwiga. 
How are you? 
Are you sniffing paint? 
Of course I am! 
Men need alcohol. 
It's the first thing every civilization makes along with weapons and shelters to enjoy prostitutes. 
I don't know how much more of this Ian take. 
This is the worst day of my life. 
Your life? 
Of your life? 
Oh, God. How are we going 
to make this about you? 
It's my birthday, Jack! 
It's my 40th birthday, and no one remembered! 
Damn you, she-beasts! 
What? 
You and Avery. 
You lay these traps to make me fail! 
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday, Lemon. 
It's not my best day. 
I'm not myself right now. 
Please accept this $1,000 as my gift to you. 
I will take this on principle, but it doesn't fix anything. 
What can I tell you? 
This is what happens to people like us who put work ahead of everything else. 
You know where I spent my 40th birthday? 
In my office. 
All night. 
Wow. 
You were really fit back then. 
Yes, but my penis was smaller. 
Look, Jack, I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. 
I mean, I know who I am. 
I know I'm not the funnest person in the group. 
I'm not the one you call when you want to go club OGT town and party dancing all night. 
Why are you speaking like a persian immigrant? 
But I thought I at least these dummies would do something instead of light fires I have to put out. 
I thought when I turned 40... 
40. 
I could really drink a forty right now. 
Oprah, this is what the inside of a child's face looks like. 
Oh, no! 
My Oprah wig is falling off! 
This is an exciting mishap! 
This is live! 
What the blurg? 
Oh. 
Jenna, have you been drinking? 
No, Jack. 
I mean, I had a bottle of wine with dinner. 
Can I smell your mouth? 
I thought you'd never ask. 
Thank you. 
I really needed that. 
I have been giving up drinking while Avery is pregnant, and it's really, really hard. 
Of course. But caring about 
someone means making sacrifices. 
Being with Paul has taught me that. 
It's made me more mature and... 
Oh, no, Tracy. 
It is nipple time! 
Now my moustache is ask! 
Oops, that thing fell off! 
And that thing, too! 
Uh-oh! 
My shirt is accidentally falling off! 
Ha ha ha! 
I warned you, Liz! 
And now I'm slipping a nip! 
The big one! 
Go to commercial! 
Go! 
Hi, I'm Dr. Drew Baird. 
Every year, dozens of people lose a hand to a helicopter or fireworks mishap. 
Or, in my case, both. 
But now there's hope. 
Thanks to an idea that started as a pitch for a horror movie and grew into a charitable organization, hands from executed criminals are now making life better for people all over the world. 
People like me. 
But we can't do it without your support. 
So give... 
And give someone a hand. 
Sorry. I'm trying to 
do a thumbs-up here. 
Oh, no. 
That's a black power thing. 
No. 
Why are you doing this? 
No. 
Bad hand! 
Oh, God, it's got my testicles! 
Listen up. 
We forgot Liz Lemon's birthday. 
Her 40th birthday. 
How?! 
You gave me your list! 
Enough! 
Never mind how it happened. 
That's water under the bridge. 
I'm sorry, we don't have that expression in Canada. 
Does it mean that what happened can be used to power a lumbermill? 
It means that we're going to do something nice for our friend Liz Lemon, because she takes care of us. 
We're going to take care of her, even if we are currently sober for the first time in ten years. 
Not me. I just got my 
ten-year drunk chip. 
Thank you. 
Pete, what can you pull together? 
Is there time to do something for Liz on air? Not really. 
I mean, I could cut the product placement for capital one. 
Oh, you can't do that. 
The capital one venture card is amazing. 
They give double miles every day for every purchase! 
Or the cast could say something during goodnights. 
No, it has to be big enough that Liz will believe we planned it all along. 
I've got an idea! 
What... 
If... 
We... 
Spit it out! 
Please set yourself for goodnight. 
Did you crash? 
No, but it was pretty scary. 
I mean, not like the stuff I saw in the air force, of course. 
Like this one time a bunch of us pilots got together and went to a haunted house in Germany. 
It was messed up. 
Today is my birthday, Carol. 
It's your birthday. 
Dammit. 
I'm sorry. 
Happy Birthday, Lizzie. 
Don't worry about it. 
I've known these dummies a lot longer, and none of them... Oh, my God. 
You did remember. 
Wait. Wait. 
What's happening there? 
Is that a surprise party? 
Surprise! 
I was totally in on it. 
It was really expensive. 
Happy Birthday, Lemon. 
You... you knew all along? 
Come on, you didn't think we'd forget, did you? 
30 seconds! 
Is that a polka band? 
Happy Birthday! 
Wait a minute. 
Wait. 
Why is Henry Winkler on my cake? 
I like fonzi. 
This is supposed to be for Jadwiga. 
No, everybody loves the fonz! 
10 seconds! 
You stole an old cleaning lady's birthday just to make me happy? 
In my defense, yes. 
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me! 
Five seconds. 
Five, four, three... 
On behalf of everyone "TGS", we want to... 
Good night! 
Well, I know your birthday isn't what you hoped, Lemon, but at least it was memorable. 
You know what? 
It was perfect. 
It was the best of both worlds. 
It was... yeah, sorry. 
It's the best of both worlds. 
I got to feel martyred and Indig napt all day, and I still got to eat cake off the floor. 
I still have one birthday wish. 
I want to you have a drink with me. 
Well, I know Avery doesn't want me to, but it's dangerous to say no to an old spinster. 
You might turn me into a crow. 
To you, Liz Lemon. 
You're halfway to death. 
That's more like it. 
thank you to Matt Damon, Rachel, bill, John, Julia Luis Drefes. Everyone on NBC. 
SNL crew, I love you. 
﻿1 It doesn't matter how long you've lived in New York, it's still fun to look up and pretend all the buildings are giant severed robot penises. 
Be quiet, Lemon. 
It's happening. 
Wow... 
Out with G.E., 
in with Kabletown. 
It seems like one of us should sing The Circle Game right now. 
30 years at G.E.... 
Now it's on to phase two. 
I'm like Keats' "Stout Cortez," staring at the Pacific with a wild surmise and daring to imagine what... 
New planets might swim into my ken. 
So will we be getting new employee I.D.s? 
'Cause I'd really like to retake my photo. 
Good God, what happened? 
I was holding in a "snart," and then right when she took the photo... 
Don't you want to know what a "snart" is? 
I can tell you now. 
It's 10:00. 
10:00 in the morning. 
Ugh. 
FYI, Tracy's phoning it in today. 
What else is new? 
No, mother, literally. 
Are you also staying at this hotel? 
Line. 
Tracy, we have been playing this game for five years now. 
 When is it ever gonna stop? 
 I don't know. 
After I win a bunch of awards for my movie, it's not gonna get better. 
I don't see how it could get any worse. 
Good question, Liz Lemon. 
When you win an Oscar, it opens up an elite level of actor craziness... 
throwing telephones at hotel employees, speaking to the U.N. about 
some messed-up crap in Africa, and I'm definitely getting a private island. 
You're getting an island? 
Every crazy A-lister owns an island... 
Nicholas Cage, Celine Dion, Charles Widmore. 
This is a whole new world in front of me, L.L. 
I'm like Stout Cortez! 
He's my gardener. 
He's easily amazed. 
You have two choices here. 
Either you can stay in your room, like a child, or you can get out there and do your job. 
Thank you. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
That was misleading. 
I'm not gonna rehearse. 
I'm gonna get a sandwich and then eat it on the toilet. 
 What are you wearing? 
 My NBC page dress blues. 
I want to look good, in case I get on camera. 
On what camera? 
Well, Mrs. Jordan's 
reality show is gonna be following Mr. Jordan 
around while he's at work. 
 What? 
 I know! 
Isn't it exciting? 
I've never been on TV before. 
I hope I photograph okay, because when I look into a mirror, there's just a white haze. 
Who told Tracy he could bring cameras here? 
Well, Mr. Donaghy. 
Uh, here... 
I couldn't put the memo in your mailbox, 'cause it's full of unread adoption materials. 
Yeah. 
Hey. 
Are the reality cams here? 
Oh, God, Lutz, why? 
What? 
I don't want tush lines. 
Oh! 
You know... 
I have enough problems with Tracy. 
I don't need cameras following him around while he's here. 
Do you know what pays for your show, Lemon? 
Our product placement with Sullivan Psychiatric Clinic. 
"Sullivan Psychiatric... 
You'll drool over our crazy prices." 
Reality TV. 
A woman with "hundruplets," a live execution, the real transvestite hoarders of Orange County Penitentiary. 
Ugh, that show is upsetting. 
Why does the warden let Lady Extravaganza have so many spoons? 
Programs like that are the lifeblood of this industry. 
They're cheap, promotable, and even if they're terrible, you get a rating and move on to the next idea. 
Everybody wins. 
Well, I happen to think we are in a new golden age of scripted television. 
Shh, shh. 
Lemon, it's okay. 
As I begin phase two of my jack attack on Kabletown, I've been doing some research. 
Do you know what the most successful reality events of the past five years are? 
Celebrity benefits for natural disasters. 
The viewership is huge. 
Yes, but those ratings mean nothing. 
All the networks air those benefits at the same time, so no one gets an advantage. 
True, unless only one network is carrying it, because only one network is ready to broadcast a benefit on the night of the disaster. 
But that's impossible. 
There's not enough time to put it together. 
Unless you've pretaped the show beforehand and filmed options for every possible disaster scenario. 
You're going to pretape a benefit for a disaster that hasn't happened yet? 
 Yeah. 
 That is bad karma, Jack. 
I mean, this morning, I stole a cab from a pregnant lady on crutches, and I am just waiting... 
Uh, my goodness, Lemon. 
The people affected will still get money, but so will NBC. 
Everybody wins. 
Oh, and I need Jenna to sing. 
I'll do it! 
But I hate my dress. 
All right, listen up, everybody. 
I need ideas from you people for potential natural disasters... 
Anything that might require a televised celebrity benefit. 
I need something new, and I need it by the end of the day, so... 
Let's get to work. 
Well, I just finished a screenplay where a tidal wave destroys Washington. 
Someone write down tidal wave. 
Shut him up. 
What about a tornado that hits a handgun factory, and it's just spinning around shooting handguns? 
What happens when the second flood comes, and you aren't allowed on reverend Gary's ark? 
Especially since reverend Gary made it clear the ark is just for teenage boys. 
You know, with global weirding and everything, stuff like that could totally happen here. 
There was a cyclone in Brooklyn last year. 
It destroyed two vintage-t-shirt stores and a banjo. 
If something does happen, it'll probably be while we're at work. 
I mean, this is where we spend all of our time. 
We should have a plan in place. 
If we don't, I will freak out and start karate-kicking people. 
Everyone needs an emergency plan. 
For instance, right before the ark leaves, I'm supposed to castrate reverend Gary. 
I see you finally decided to come to work. 
Of course. 
I'm just continuing my consistent professional behavior. 
Let's laugh together, friend. 
 What's going on with him? 
 First of all, good morning. 
And to answer your question, it's Angie's cameras. 
These reality shows want crazy behavior, so Tracy's keeping it boring... 
Give them nothing that could make him look bad. 
Since when does Tracy care about looking bad? 
Since he got nominated for an Oscar. 
Then once he wins, it's on to the next level, which I am not looking forward to. 
That island he wants to buy is filled with scorpions. 
Let's do it again from the top. 
I want to get it perfect, because perfection is my middle name... 
"Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy." 
So here's the plan. 
If anything happens, we meet outside under the Atlas statue, walk to the 59th Street bridge, and try to get to my mom's house in Queens. 
Okay, good. 
We've got a wide skill set for any post-apocalyptic scenario. 
I'm good at archery and kind of want to die. 
I can use my glasses to start a fire. 
Toofer can get us through black, gay, and nerd-controlled neighborhoods. 
Cerie will be some sort of queen in the new society. 
I will do sex with cannibals as needed. 
I can talk to animals. 
Well, not talk to 'em... 
I can take commands from 'em. 
Huh. Lutz... What can he do? 
Well, he's slow and a coward. 
I'm not useless. 
I mean, I've got a car. 
Oh, I didn't know that. 
All right, Lutz is the driver. 
W-wait. 
How big is your car? 
 Can it fit all of us? 
 Oh, right. 
It's actually pretty small. 
I could only take three of you... 
So I'll have to choose. 
That sucks. 
It's like a reality show where you guys get to compete for a seat in my car by proving how much you like me. 
Tracy, I need you to do something. 
Of course, friend. 
Teamwork is the key to success. 
Yeah. 
You need to stay late for a wardrobe fitting tonight. 
It should take about two hours. 
Okay. 
No problem. 
After that, I need you to record that DVD commentary that you've been putting off for five years. 
Hope you didn't have plans tonight. 
No, I wasn't gonna buy two blimps and crash them into each other to see what sound they made. 
Look, is there anything that you two could maybe fight about? 
An argument that culminates in a racial slur would be lovely. 
Sorry, this is gonna be nice and boring. 
Tracy's even going to agree to attend a fundraiser for my cousin's dance studio. 
Aren't you, Tracy? 
So we're good? 
Never better. 
I'm as happy as a clam that wants to kill some woman. 
Great. 
You're the best. 
Love you! 
Love you more! 
Boy, I-I don't know, Jack. 
This just doesn't feel right. 
Bob, it's for charity. 
And if you don't do it, I'll have MSNBC tell the world you grew up in England. 
But I'm so identified with New York, you bloody tosser! 
Bob... 
Okay. 
Disaster options, take one. 
"We'll always remember where we were "when we heard that tornado had hit a handgun factory. 
"Two days ago, when people thought of a mudslide, "they just thought of getting drunk in an Applebee's. 
"But now we know it as the thing that destroyed Denver. 
"When the birds first started attacking us, "we all thought it was pretty funny and made Hitchcock jokes. 
"But we're not laughing now, "because our laughter excites the birds sexually. 
"This devastating wildfire. 
"This horrible flood. 
"This wonderful flood "that put out that devastating wildfire. 
These super-intelligent sharks." 
Tracy, I just thought of a few more things I need from you. 
 Shut your mouth   I am finished taking orders from you   and I think that you're a four-eyed douche  Wow, Tracy, I don't want to interrupt this moment. 
This is great stuff, but that's Billy Joel's. 
Anything you sing to that tune, uh... 
I can't use on the show. 
 That's too bad   but if I say you cannot do anything   to make me look bad on your TV show   and also let me say that Liz is a ho   a dirty ho   You are a child   and you're losing your mi-i-i-nd   I want to kick you   I'm not good at making up songs   unlike me, who is good   as you can tell from this rhyme   whoa oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh oh oh   Whoa oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh oh   The thing that happened   was so sad   we can't believe it got so bad   when the stuff we know occurred   went down   so find it in your heart   step up and do your part   and help the people the thing that happened   happened to   help the people   the thing that happened   happened to  Fantastic, Jenna. 
You really brought the songwriting computer's words to life. 
Wow, you're actually doing this. 
Yes, all I'm missing is the disaster. 
Well, I'm in the middle of a Tracy disaster. 
I thought I could use Angie's cameras to make him behave, but he found a loophole, and now, to close it, I need $80,000 to buy the rights to Uptown Girl. 
Lemon, it sounds like you're trying to fight crazy with crazy. 
Yeah, because crazy is the only language that Tracy is fluent in. 
But you'll never out-crazy Tracy, so why don't you have it out with him once and for all, like two adults? 
Because we're not two adults, Jack. 
One of us is an actor, and actors are not people. 
Someone get a P.A. 
to feed me baby food, or I will drop a "d" in the green room! 
Yeah. 
Last week you thought I was crying wolf, didn't you? 
Lutz is the best. 
 Nice feet, Lutz. 
 I like Lutz the most. 
Look at all of you trying to impress me. 
I feel like the bachelor. 
But, uh, whom shall I give my rose? 
It's so hard to choose when everyone loves me so much. 
But only three of you can ride to safety in my car. 
Mmm! 
I don't really have a car. 
Tracy, your little singing game is over. 
I got auto-tune for my computer, and if you try to sing, I'll just take out the melody, and no one has to pay for that. 
 Liz Lemon won   do do do do  That was me singing the Beatles' Here Comes the Sun for free. 
L.L., please. 
I'm way ahead of you. 
And I'm not rehearsing. 
I'm going to shoot garden gnomes with a handgun at Tupac's house. 
Yeah, Tupac is alive. 
I bet you'd like to have that on your show. 
Yes, Tracy, obviously. 
But again, I can't use any of it when you're wearing that mask. 
The Rangers logo is trademarked. 
Okay, fine. 
Jack was right. 
I can't out-crazy you. 
So we're gonna talk, right now. 
No cameras. 
All right, Tracy, the kid gloves are coming off. 
Oh, that explains it. 
Those are gloves. 
No wonder they're so coarse and wrinkly. 
Five years ago, I rescued your career. 
And how do you repay me? 
By making my life harder at every turn. 
You are late. 
You blow off rehearsals. 
And your online romance prank was not funny! 
I fell in love with you! 
You wore a yellow hat to that coffee shop. 
You know what's actually funny about all this? 
You think I'm the problem. 
Have you ever tried to work with you? 
Really? 
You're trying to blame me? 
Five years ago, I saved your show. 
I rode in here on a white horse that you made me leave in the lobby. 
All you do is stifle me when you should be thanking me. 
Oh, yeah, I should be thanking you. 
Without me, do you have any idea where you would be right now? 
This honky grandma be trippin' over surfmaster's mid-range jet skis! 
Where do you think you would be without me? 
Now, Jerry, in rehearsal, it's okay to play with yourself. 
But when we do the show... 
Hey, dummy, you got to drive me to paintball, and no complaining. 
The only reason why I got that DUI is 'cause it was your birthday. 
What's up, Jerry? 
That's awesome. 
Well, at least Jerry bothered to come to rehearsal. 
And in my alternate reality, Dennis dies, and I win the lottery. 
But then I would run you over with a jet ski! 
Damn it! 
Jonathan, come in here! 
Fantastic news... 
There's been a natural disaster. 
Was it in Indian Kashmir? 
May Durga's trident pierce them from the skies! 
No. A typhoon just hit 
an island in the South Pacific, and news is going to full-time coverage! 
It's perfect. 
The island is called Mago. 
It's near Fiji. 
Heavy structural damage, no fatalities... 
Sad, but not too sad. 
We'll get footage of beautiful Polynesian people, proud and topless, maybe a pelican near some diapers. 
I don't know. 
Oh, it's all happening so fast. 
We haven't even given this plan a code name. 
Haven't we? 
Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning is a go. 
Okay, first of all, I look weird there because I'm "snarting." 
You "snarted" in my dressing room? 
And second of all, I said no cameras. 
That footage cannot be shown on television. 
I'm trying to buy a island over here. 
I'm sorry, Tray, but now I just need a heartfelt resolution. 
So we're gonna use a little reality-TV magic. 
We call it staging it or lying. 
We'll shoot you guys meeting in the hallway. 
Uh, you apologize, you hug. 
Ugh. 
You are disgusting. 
And I have absolutely no reason to apologize to him. 
And I have no reason to hug her, other than my love of having boobs pressed against me. 
If I hugged you, I would angle it so that you got no boob. 
And I would anticipate your angling, and I would get there. 
I would get there. 
Yah! 
Hey, buddy, I made you an apocalypse road trip mix. 
I hope your car has a CD player. 
It has two. 
And it has flames on the side. 
Oh. 
Lutzy, guess what. 
A friend of mine works for Marvel, and he got me four tickets to a test screening of Captain America tonight! 
Nice! 
Chris Evans' body looks amazing in the trailer. 
When's his Men's Health cover? 
Okay, so who you gonna take with you besides Frank? 
Dude, make up your mind. 
We have to be in Harrison by 6:00. 
Wait. 
It's in New Jersey? 
How are we getting to New Jersey? 
You're going to drive us, obviously. 
What am I gonna do? 
Where have you been, sir? 
Have you seen the news? 
I don't have to, Jonathan. 
I know what's on it... 
The poor people of Mago Island and their brave shorts-wearing police force. 
If you're just joining us, this is NBC's continuing coverage of the devastation in Mago... 
the Fijian island owned by controversial actor Mel Gibson. 
Good God. 
We are receiving reports of extensive damage to the main house, as well as the house for Gibson's cars. 
No word yet on the fate of Gibson's collection of anti-semitic and misogynistic literature. 
No! 
No, this is not a prank. 
This is Jack Donaghy. 
And I'm calling about Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning. 
Hello? 
We are joined now by a relative of the island's owner... 
Oskar Gibson. 
G'day. 
First off, the holocaust never happened. 
Aah! 
We go now to NBC's exclusive primetime benefit for the victims of the devastation in Mago, specifically Mel Gibson and his houseguest, Jon Gosselin. 
Why do bad things happen to good people? 
We'll never know. 
But look at these pictures. 
Look at these beautiful souls... 
And pick up the phone. 
Every dollar you give to help... 
Mel Gibson... 
Will go towards rebuilding... 
His sex jacuzzi. 
 And help the people   the thing that happened   happened to  Oh, here he comes! 
Pick me, Lutzy! 
Pick me! 
Now, you can't all fit, so... 
Dude, did you just buy that car? 
What? 
There's a dealer sticker in the window, you got no plates, and you made these flames out of magic marker and tape! 
I'd rather die than ride with him. 
 Let's go. 
 Uh, okay. 
But now I do have a car, so everything's like it was before. 
It's all like it was before! 
 And help the people the thing that happened   happened to   help the...  
Mm, we now return to Queen of Jordan. 
 You heard me! 
 Ugh. 
What the hell? 
Tracy, I need you. 
 Of course, friend. 
 So we're good? 
 Never better. 
 You're the best. 
 Love you. 
 Love you more! 
Let's never fight again. 
No, never, Tracy. 
I know it's fake, but... 
Damn it, I miss him. 
I knew I'd get that boob squish. 
 Honestly, I swear   thought you saw me wink...  
Tracy, I'm sorry. 
Don't. You already said it 
all on the show. 
You said it all. 
 I got there. 
 I'm angling. 
I'm angling. 
Hey. 
Are you okay? 
Oh, you're kidding. 
Your dumb stunt worked? 
It was our highest rating since that episode of SVU where the detectives watched American Idol. 
It was a train wreck. 
It was reality TV. 
It can be good. 
It can be terrible. 
It just can't be anything in between. 
You know, some people actually craft stories. 
And when the story doesn't have an ending you don't just create one out of thin air by playing music or having people give each other meaningful looks. 
Sure, that might manipulate the audience into thinking they're feeling something, but it sucks. 
The writers put it on my door. 
I don't know what that's referring to. 
It's referring to this one time that I got a chemical peel before work, and I was wearing a red and green sweater and a fedora. 
But these douche-bs have been doing this for weeks. 
 "Lez Lemon." 
 First thought. 
"Winona Ryder in a hundred years." 
 Weak. 
 "Fart Barfunkel." 
 Indian food. 
 "Paul Simon." 
I don't get that, but it hurts. 
Ok, I love a good joke, but I am their boss, and, at a certain point, it crosses a line. 
To quote Rodney Dangerfield, "Hey, I... 
Hey, I..." No, let's see... 
Lemon, if you're about to say that you don't get any respect, you're right. 
I mean, in a post-apocalyptic world, how would society even use you? 
Traveling bard. 
Radiation canary. 
I have to run, Lemon. 
I have an appointment in Washington. 
The hearings on the Kabletown-NBC deal are underway, and the company has entrusted me to be their front man. 
Hey, will you ask congress where they put the USA network? 
I've been trying to find monk for, like, three months. 
The only thing I will be discussing with the house subcommittee on baseball, quiz shows, terrorism, and media is vertical integration. 
What's vertical integration? 
Imagine that your favorite corn chip manufacturer also owned the number one diarrhea medication. 
That'd be great, 'cause then they could put a little sample of the medicine in each bag. 
Keep thinking. 
Except then they might be tempted to make the corn chips give you... 
Vertical integration. 
Wow, that should not be allowed to happen. 
But it's my job to make sure that it does happen. 
Do you know who gets elected to congress these days? 
Former athletes, washed-up actors, and women. 
I'm locked and loaded and ready for whatever these beltway lobotomites throw at me. 
What if we have to stay overnight and there aren't enough rooms, so we have to share a room, and I forgot to bring a shirt to sleep in and the stores are all closed... 
Liz, quick question about the Johnny Appleseed sketch. 
Does it hurt it if we can't call him Johnny Appleseed? 
Yes. Why? 
Well, Johnny Appleseed was a real guy, and his descendants are very litigious. 
So here is a list of the names that legal says we can use. 
Jerry Bananaseed. 
And nothing else. 
Great, so what are my choices? 
Either I argue with legal or I spend all day writing something else? 
Does anyone care how hard I work...  
Oh! 
We can't use Jerry Bananaseed. 
Someone with that name killed a bunch of nurses in Portland. 
Kenneth. 
You're back. 
I need you to get me something called vagitrax. 
It's for dry knees. 
I wish I were back, miss Maroney. 
I'm reapplying to the page program. 
But it's a lot harder than my first time around. 
It's gotten really competitive. 
You shoulda seen what I saw in Mr. Winerslav's office. 
Well, your interview will be Thursday. 
Is there any a/v equipment you'll be needing? 
 Equipment? 
  Inside Schwartz 21   hill street blues, wings is fun   golden girls, quantum leap   outsourced is the new friends  The process used to be dignified. 
Now it's just a pageant. 
Just a pageant? 
That's like saying a guy is cool because he has just a speedboat. 
If you need help winning a pageant, you've come to the right place. 
Well, if it'll get me back into the page program. 
When I was pageantizing, my mother told me there's only three things standing between you and winning... 
your breasts and wanting it bad enough. 
I'm not sure that applies... 
we've already started. 
And this deal will count as a 39% bump variable against an 11% increase Sir, my name is Rob Reiner. 
And before I became a Congressman, I dabbled in television, won a couple of Emmys. 
And I believe that my experience out there in hollyweird gives me a special insight into these types of deals, particularly when it comes to... 
Say it, meathead. 
Vertical integration. 
Ahh, the dreaded V.I. 
Bad for America, kills innovation, drives up prices. 
Is that it? 
I guess that's why big oil and Microsoft are such great American failures. 
 What?  Dare I say vertical 
integration drives down prices by streamlining the process. 
Consider the farmer. 
He owns his land, the equipment he uses to harvest his crops, the truck that he uses to drive that product to the farmers' market where he sells it directly to the consumer. 
Is that not vertical integration? 
1:32 P.M. 
Mark the time, ladies and gentlemen, that congress put a bullet in the head of the American farmer. 
No! You win! 
The acclaimed director of when Harry met Sally would never do that. 
As always, it's been a pleasure. 
Mr. 
Donaghy, one last question. 
Why is NBC so racist? 
Horrible. 
What else can you do? 
 Oh, everybody   born before Jesus   is in hell   they went straight...  
Enough. 
I'm gonna have to reinvent you. 
Break you down completely and build you up from scratch. 
Just like Mickey Rourke did me to sexually. 
But miss Maroney, I don't want to be reinvented I want to be me. 
All right, first things first. 
Can you lose that goony accent? 
Well, I don't know, ma'am. 
You made me think about it, and when I get to thinkin' 'bout it, it just get worse. 
Mr. Donaghy, 
I represent Rhode island's first congressional district. 
It's a diverse community, from the hard-working moms and dads of Smithfield to those spoiled jags at brown to a thriving, flourishing Italian criminal community in Providence. 
It's my responsibility to make sure that public airwaves represent the face of my public. 
Now, one question, why is it that NBC looks about as diverse as a Wilco concert? 
I would point to Sunday night football, which features many black players and coaches. 
Oh, and we have Anthony Anderson, the star of law & order, which is entering its 21st... 
It's been cancelled! 
What? 
Why did we cancel that? 
That doesn't make any sense. 
Mr. Donaghy, this may just be 
about money to you, but, as a member of congress and a black woman... 
I don't really see color or gender, Mr. Chang. 
I feel I have an extra duty, not just to my constituents, but to future generations. 
Now, unless I see some serious change at NBC and soon, I can guarantee you this deal will not happen. 
Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb. 
Peas and carrots. 
Rhubarb. Rhubarb. 
Peas and carrots. 
Rhubarb. 
Dotcom, you run Tracy's production company, right? 
Yes. Dotcom productions. 
That's Tracy Jordan spelled backwards. 
 Well, I need programming for the African-American community, and nobody knows that demographic better than you. 
Don't worry about it, Jackie D, I'm on it. 
Call Grizz. 
I need someone around who's not just a yes man. 
Whatever you say, Tray. 
Oh. 
Come on, Walter. 
What is going on? 
Representative Regina Bookman is using the Kabletown hearings as a soap box from which to complain about a lack of diversity on TV. 
Well, she has a point. 
I was reading the new Malcolm Gladwell new yorker piece on my kindle. 
Did you really read that? 
No, I did not. 
I really resent the congresswoman's accusations. 
I've long been an advocate for diversity. 
It's made this nation great. 
The Chinese built the railroads, the Irish built and then filled the jails... 
A guy named Juan built my armoire. 
Diversity means new ideas and new markets. 
It is our best hope for true innovation. 
Did you tell all that to congresswoman Bookman? 
No, I was too busy trying to remember the name of the black kid on community. 
D'nall glover. 
It wouldn't have mattered anyway. 
The whole thing was just political theater. 
You should have seen her grandstanding. 
The future and America. 
Now I may have lost my train of thought several minutes ago, but if I continue to talk like this, no one will notice, and when I stop, you will applaud my energy. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
I can't let Bookman jeopardize this deal. 
Tell me about diversity at TGS. 
Well, Lutz claims to be inuit. 
At least that was his explanation when I found his poem about snow. 
What about Toofer? 
Is he any good? 
I don't know if he's mentioned this to you 100 times, but he went to Harvard. 
So we know he's smart and superb at masturbation. 
Ha. 
Is there any way we can give him a promotion of some kind? 
Sure. 
Make him co-head writer. 
I always figured he'd take over for me when I die at my desk. 
Really? 
You're okay with that? 
Oh, yeah. Let someone else share 
the total lack of respect, deal with the meetings, the complaining, the stupid Johnny Appleseed sketch. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
You are not doing a sketch on the Appleseed family. 
Monty Appleseed and I share a liquor locker at the opera. 
 I forgot my doctor said no more frustrated noises, because it makes my vocal cords go... 
Now it's gonna be like this all day. 
There you are. 
I've got hair extensions for you and a body shaper with a reinforced penile sleeve. 
Miss maroney, please. 
My feet are killing me. 
I am trying to help you, Kenneth. 
Believe me, I wish you weren't such a Houston foreclosure of a human being, but I need to tear you down and turn you into someone that can actually win this thing. 
They hired keyboard guy? 
He's not even recycling properly. 
Miss maroney, wait. 
So what do we want to see on TV? 
I personally love cop shows. 
I can't wait for law & order to start back up. 
Why? 
It was a tentpole! 
A tentpole! 
Well, here's something I've been working on. 
It's called let's stay together. 
After the Al Green song. 
It focuses on an African-American family in Detroit in the '70s. 
Motown, the auto industry, Vietnam, Watergate. 
Let's stay together is not just about a family trying to stay together, but also a nation. 
What if there was a talking dog? 
I'd like to see that incorporated into your rewrite. 
Okay, meeting over. 
 Thank you, NBC   for all the laughs and tears   once home to Kelsey Grammer   the golden girls, my name is Earl   the a-team and cheers   so shine on and thank you   NBC  A top-ten network. 
Smile. 
Okay, let's dig in, cohorts. 
It means the badger in Spanish. 
I'm not sure who did it. 
Toofer's got a head writer sign on his door. 
It's great. 
Good for him. 
Oh, God. 
Tejon face. 
Is this about the TV interview? 
What TV interview? 
It's nothing. 
It's just a local cable show. 
 Well, if my cohead writer is being interviewed, then so am I. 
Aqui viene el tejon! 
 The only thing that worked in the read-through was the dog. 
 How's production going, Tray? 
 Good. 
And there's a lot of buzz. 
Can you hear it too? 
Or is my tinnitus acting up? 
Hey! That food 
is for Dotcom productions only. 
TGS's food is backstage. 
But they don't have women's sports bars. 
Men can have cramping too, you know. 
Mr. Donaghy, I have representative 
Bookman on the line. Oh. 
Representative Bookman. 
Mr. Donaghy, 
I'm in New York right now. 
Some colleagues of mine and I are taking meetings on wall street and then we're doing a sex and the city walking tour. 
Magnolia bakery? 
Oh, sorry, hips. 
But it looks like I'll have time to stop by and continue our conversation. 
Good. 
I welcome it. 
As I was trying to say the other day, this company has a long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. 
Yo, Jackie D, I had dinner with don Imus last night. 
He told the following joke... 
 Goodbye, congresswoman. 
I can't believe they rejected me. 
Well, of course they did. 
The bridge was supposed to be shuffle-ball-change, maxi Ford, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, double-time shim-sham-shimmy, toe punch. 
I don't know what you were doing. 
I'm sorry, miss maroney. 
And where was your sparkle? 
You embarrassed me in front of all the other mothers. 
If you think you're going to sizzler tonight, Jenna, you got another thing coming. 
Oh, you'll be practicing your steps in the garage until the school boat comes. 
If I hadn't seen you come out of me in that parking, I'd swear you weren't my daughter. 
Oh, my God. 
What just happened? 
I think you just turned into... 
let me get there. 
I've turned into my mother. 
And I turned you into me. 
You're welcome. 
But it was wrong. 
Well, to make it up to me... 
let me get there! 
To make it up to you, I am going to get your job back or my name isn't Yustrepa Gronkowitz. 
I mean, Jenna maroney. 
Welcome to right on. 
I'm your host, Rutherford Rice. 
With me is my co-host Shirley Thomas. 
Our topic for today is African-Americans and their roles in the Mia. 
Our first guest is James Spurlock, head writer for TGS with Tracy Jordan. 
 Good day, tristaters. 
 Co. 
Co-head writer. 
And also with us is someone named Elizabeth Lemon. 
Thank you, Rutherford. 
It is a pl... 
I can tell that you're off me. 
Mr. Spurlock, do you think the 
system is broken when it is news that an African-American man is a head writer for a network TV show? 
I think I can answer that. 
Another question that we could be asking is why isn't it a big deal that a woman is a head writer. 
I would argue that TV is more of a boys club than a white club. 
I like your dress. 
Do you have to wear a bra with it? 
I will let you get back to Toofer. 
Who's Toofer? 
I don't know. 
James, when people think of TGS, they think of Tracy Jordan, Jenna maroney, the mysterious crew deaths, the Angela Lansbury lawsuit. 
What they don't think of is you working long hours late into the night, giving up any semblance of a life. 
Well, James Spurlock, you can finally take your bow. 
You are right on's Arthur Ashe of the week. 
Okay, you know what? 
I get it. 
I shouldn't be here. 
I should have realized that when I saw the masks and the picture of black Jesus. 
That's me in college. 
All righty. 
All right, I said I was leaving. 
You don't have to have your boss come and... 
that's a security guard. 
That's not great. 
Sir, representative Bookman is on her way up. 
Jonathan, what did we talk about? 
But, sir, I was born in Palo Alto. 
I will go get her, sir. 
A thousand apologies. 
 Jack, it's an actor me-mgency. 
I want to get Kenneth back into the page program, but whatever this is won't let me. 
What? Who care Jeffrey, 
just hire Kenneth back. 
But Mr. Donaghy, 
the only... 
I don't have time for this. 
Just do it. 
Thank you, Jack. 
 Mr. Donaghy.  Representative 
Bookman, welcome to NBC. 
This is the perfect place to begin our tour. 
Studio 6h, home to one of NBCs biggest stars, Tracy Jordan. 
Mr. 
Jordan, Regina Bookman. 
We met at the congressional black caucus fundraiser you crashed your motorcycle into. 
And thank you, representative. 
What you're doing is very important. 
I can assure you that NBC is committed to making diversity a priority. 
Then just walk away and don't try to kiss her, Tracy, and don't say that last part. 
Hey. You eat 
from your own table, remember? 
Our food is separate. 
Separate! 
I'll kill you, white devil! 
Let's just head this way. 
So how was your flight? 
Congresswoman, this is Jeffrey Winerslav. 
He heads our diversity and hiring initiative. 
What's the latest from H.R., Jeffrey? 
Well, I'd like to tell you that we filled the minority slot in the NBC page program with a native American fellow named wants to get sandwiches, but you made me hire that guy instead. 
Oh, brother. 
Mr. Shoelace, you're being silly. 
You call that a diversity hire? 
Maybe. 
That young man is a hillbilly with a girl's middle name and, because his county never rejoined the union, a foreigner. 
Now you're untied? 
Have you two been talking? 
There's James. 
Attention, everyone. 
Oh, give me a break. 
I present you, James Spurlock, with the 2010 Tavis Smiley excellence in broadcasting award. 
Thank you for making us all smiley. 
Mr. Spurlock, how long have 
you been head writer here? 
 One day. 
 Mmhmm. 
And who is the real head writer of this show? 
I am. 
Ah. Tell me, you obviously 
lonely and tired woman. 
Do you have to put up with this nonsense every day? 
 Yes.  You know, they 
say 90% of the work is done by 10% of the people. 
Thank you for being that 10%. 
You're welcome. 
After what I just saw, you may be the only person here I respect. 
You get an "I met a congresswoman" sticker. 
Thank you. 
Finally. 
That's all I wanted... 
This country was founded on certain principles. 
Oh, brother. 
Freedom, troops, America, flag. 
Now I might not ow where I'm going with this, but I know we will get there together! 
Who loves pizza? 
Congresswoman, a word. 
Okay, fine, I was putting on a show. 
I was tap dancing. 
But you made me tap dance. 
Did someone say tap dance? 
What was I supposed to do? 
This is a multibillion-dollar deal. 
There are thousands of jobs at stake, hundreds of second homes, and your ridiculous grandstanding could ruin the whole thing, like luffing your spinnaker during a yachting regatta. 
I know I'm not helping myself. 
Sorry. 
Grandstanding? 
Do you not think I believe in this? 
It's just political theater. 
You're up for reelection. 
Yes, maybe I get carried away sometimes with my love for this great country and the troops and the flagtroops... 
you're doing it. 
And I apologize. 
But I only talk this way so I can get people to listen. 
I care about these issues. 
And so do I. 
If you just give me a chance instead of ambushing me in front of the congress and my own employees. 
You think I don't take diversity seriously? 
Only a fool doesn't. 
Diversity is the engine that drives this country. 
We are an immigrant nation. 
The first generation works their fingers to the bone making things. 
The next generation goes to college and innovates new ideas. 
The third generation... 
Snowboards and takes improv classes. 
We always need people who are pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. 
I did it. 
And it's my job to help others do it too. 
How do I know you really mean that? 
How do I know you're not just grandstanding? 
Oh, I'll show you how. 
Unless you give me a real reason not to, I'm voting no on this deal. 
Then I've got three months to change your mind. 
I'll show you that this company... 
I'm cutting that fat cracker's head off. 
I'm part eskimo. 
Hate crime! 
    Three months, congresswoman. 
We were here first! 
Tray! 
They closed the plant. 
I gave those people 30 years. 
I didn't even get a watch. 
All I got was this pink slip. 
You think you got it hard, I've got two dates tonight. 
Stanley, even for a dog, you are a dog. 
Yes! Great fix, Grizz. 
 Uhoh. 
Ain't life a bitch? 
Merry Christmas Eve eve, Jack. 
Likewise, Lemon. 
Is there any chance you'll still be around tomorrow? 
Sure. 
You want to go to the Penn Station Kmart with me and then watch Tootsie? 
I'm sorry. 
That's what you're doing instead of spending Christmas Eve with your family? 
It's my new thing... 
Travel on Christmas day. 
That way, I avoid the annual Lemon family blowup. 
And this year it's gonna be a doozy. 
My aunt Linda is bringing her new boyfriend, who is neither her age nor her race. 
And her ex-husband will also be there with his date, alcoholism. 
I swoop in the next day for presents and pie. 
Well, if you're around, come by for dinner. 
Colleen will be up from Florida, and, um, she'd love to see you. 
Because my youthful energy makes her feel young? 
No, because she views you as a peer she can complain with about how no one wears pantyhose any longer. 
Ah, how are we supposed to conceal our spider veins? 
Bare-legged at Christmas. 
Okay, guys, this Kabletown promo is the last thing we have to do before the holiday break. 
Liz Lemon, I cannot participate in this promo. 
Why? 
Because it's not honest. 
As an actor, it is my job to tell the truth, hold the mirror to humanity, and sell proactiv. 
I will not spout your lies, Liz Lemon. 
And I will not say merry Christmas from Kabletown. 
Ever since Tracy got nominated for a Golden Globe, he thinks he's Sean Penn. 
Well, they have both had screaming fights with Wyclef Jean. 
We'll just do this without him. 
Merry Christmas, Jenna. 
You can say both lines. 
(Crying) Merry Christmas from Kabletown and all of us at TGS. 
I think we got it. 
(Sobbing) Wait, are... are you okay? 
"Tom Ford and Elton John invite you to New Queer's Eve." 
What is this? 
NQE is the new year's party. 
Everyone dresses up as a cultural figure from the past year. 
Also replicas of the David urinate vodka. 
Oh, God. 
Paul and I were gonna come up with an amazing couple's costume. 
But now that he's gone, what's the point? 
This party means so much to me. 
I don't know what I'm gonna do without it. 
The party or Paul? 
The party, Liz. 
Good news. 
We don't have to do these promos after all. 
NBC says they want them from every show but us. 
Good year, everyone. 
(Exciting jazz music)   (Sighs) What Christmas card did we end up sending out? 
Oh... 
"Happy holidays is what terrorists say." 
Merry Christmas, Avery and Jack. 
(Knock at door) Oh, it's just Liz. 
Why do people always say that? 
Avery is keeping her pregnancy a secret at work, so she's been carrying around large objects whenever she's in the building. 
I was wondering what was up with your show last night. 
The market rallying today despite a pullback in gold stocks. 
Anyway, I was gonna bring dessert tomorrow. 
So are there any foods that are making you nauseous lately? 
Please don't say a half sleeve of oreos. 
Oh, I'm not gonna be there. 
I'm leaving tonight to spend Christmas with my family. 
Really? 
That's why I like dating older men. 
Their parents are usually dead or senile, so there's never an argument about the holidays. 
Why aren't you and Colleen going with her? 
Oh, you know, uh, Colleen is frail, and Avery is in her third trimester. 
(Gasps) You haven't told Colleen about the baby yet. 
What? 
I have been watching The Mentalist a lot lately, because my tv's on CBS, and I lost my remote. 
I think I've become a body-language expert. 
For instance, I can now tell that Jack wants to kill the person to his right. 
Why haven't you told her? 
I just haven't found the right time. 
 (Shrilly) That is no excuse! 
 (Shrilly) This is so bad! 
I cannot have the two of you on the same side of an argument. 
We Donaghys believe that, when there's something at all delicate to talk about, it is best to suppress it until it erupts into a fistfight at a church barbecue. 
I understand all that, Jack. 
The symbol on the Jessup family crest is a knight refusing to talk about his feelings, but this baby is not bad news. 
You don't know Colleen. 
We're not married, Avery. 
Why should that matter? 
I mean, she did the same thing. 
I mean, what did Colleen say when you told her you knew about your real dad? 
(Gasps) You never told her about Milton either. 
I am "The Mentaliz." 
You have so many secrets! 
That was over a year ago! 
 How do you not get hives? 
 How could you not tell her? 
For the love of God. 
Sir, this came for you. 
Thanks, K-L-M-N-O-P. 
I've been waiting for this. 
Oh, I didn't know you made another Chunks movie, Mr. Jordan. 
That first one was a classic. 
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to celebrate the life of Althea Chunk. 
(Farts) Damn, that's funky. 
Obesity is killing the african-american community... 
With laughter. 
Yeah, well, this sequel is never coming out. 
I bought the rights, so this movie won't be released. 
Why wouldn't you want people to see your movie? 
It looks so funny. 
That's the problem, Ken. 
It's 67 minutes of me acting like a hilarious fool. 
If this movie comes out before the Golden Globes, it'll ruin my new image. 
Mr. Jordan, I thought 
you loved acting like a fool. 
No, I don't. 
I'm lying. 
My favorite thing in the world is making people laugh. 
But I can't now. 
I had to go on Charlie Rose, Kenneth, Charlie Rose! 
 Oh, that's horrible. 
 I have no choice! 
I got to stay serious. 
From now on, the only movies Tracy Jordan makes are about the holocaust, Georgia O'Keeffe, or both. 
I didn't care much for the gazpacho soup. 
I mean, where's the fun of sending it back because it isn't hot? 
Mother. 
Yes. 
Avery and I are having a baby. 
I see. 
May I remind you this is good news. 
This is a disgrace! 
What are my chums at the death shore retirement community gonna say... 
When I tell them that my unmarried son has knocked up a protestant? 
Oh, I knew you would do this... 
Take a happy moment and ruin it, just like you did when I won that scholarship at my high-school graduation. 
It should have gone to the other boy! 
This is the reason I waited seven months to tell you. 
You kept this from your own mother? 
Oh, oh, Colleen, don't talk to me about secrets. 
I know some things you've done that you would not want me to bring up right now. 
Most people thought I was a hero for killing Lydia's parrot. 
I'm going upstairs now and think about more comments for tomorrow. 
This isn't over! 
(Line ringing) Jack. 
Guess what. They just got 
caller I.D. in Vermont. 
Milton, I hope you don't have plans for tomorrow. 
I'm having a little Christmas dinner, and I want you to be my guest of honor. 
Well, it is a little sudden, but, yes, I'd love to come to your holiday dinner. 
Christmas. 
It's Christmas dinner. 
(Holiday music) Hey, Rick, can you cover section three for me? 
I'm in the weeds. 
Oh, Liz. 
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought 
you were a transvestite. 
Paul, I need to talk to you about Jenna. 
Oh. 
How is she? 
Honestly, I don't think I've seen her this upset since hurricane Katrina. 
The coverage preempted a tampon commercial she was in. 
 Oh. 
 And she keeps trying to pretend it's just about some new year's party, but I think she misses you. 
Look, I-I miss her too, but it's over between us now. 
I-I don't even think about Jenna anymore. 
I don't think about kissing her or laughing with her or photographing her with just salamanders covering her nipples. 
When it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. 
You can't be on the floor without your roller skates, Rick. 
I'm not Rick. 
Merry Christmas, Jack. 
Sorry. I finished the oreos 
in the cab. 
I'm glad you could make it, Lemon. 
Welcome to my Christmas Attack Zone. 
Your what? 
What does that mean? 
Professor Milton Greene is on his way here from Penn Station. 
Milton, your father, is coming here? 
Please tell me that Colleen... 
Has no idea. 
The father that she hid from me for 50 years, the man that she doesn't even know I know exists, is joining us for supper. 
Uh, red or white? 
White. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
You promised me a drama-free dinner. 
I could be sitting at the corner table at the Kmart Cafe right now. 
(Doorbell buzzes) Oh, that must be dad. 
Wait, does Milton know that Colleen is here? 
No. I want it all 
to be fresh. 
Will he erupt with anger over her years of secrecy? 
Who knows? 
Milton's a hippie pacifist. 
But I once saw Colleen provoke a Buddhist monk into whipping a battery at her. 
My boy. 
Oh, Jack, this is going to be the best winter's Eve light festival ever. 
Liz! 
Ana happy whatever you believe in too. 
No. 
I am not letting this happen. 
Milton, Jack has an ulterior motive for bringing you here. 
Yes. It's true. 
You're going to be a grandfather. 
Oh, what a blessing! 
Oh, life is beautiful. 
"Joy, beautiful spark of the gods, daughter of Elysium." 
And, Liz, you're already showing. 
No, it's not me, a that is not what he has to tell you. 
Colleen is here, and Jack is using you to ambush her. 
 Why would you do that? 
 I'll tell you why... 
Because when my mother found out about your granddaughter... 
It's a girl! 
She'll be intuitive. 
Colleen did not see it as a blessing. 
She saw it as an embarrassment, because my girlfriend Avery and I are not married. 
An embarrassment? 
She has no right to judge you. 
She needs to read my new book, there's no wrong way to make a family. 
That's for you. 
I agree with you, Milton, but Colleen disapproves. 
Well, that's awfully hypocritical for a woman who kept her son a secret from his own father. 
I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind tonight. 
Oh, great, Avery's here, and she looks mad. 
Jack, I got your message. 
How dare Colleen disapprove of me, of us? 
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean for my message to make you angry and have you come all the way back here. 
Now there are three people here that are mad at Colleen. 
Wait, this is Avery? 
How could that woman not adore such a beautiful daughter-in-law? 
 Oh. 
 By the way, we have a tradition in my family where we let the child name itself. 
Oh, yeah, that's hippie nonsense. 
Absolutely not. 
Well, suit yourself, but my son Spider-Man turned out just fine. 
Okay, this is disgusting. 
It is Christmas. 
You are not going to ambush an old woman for the mistakes that she has made. 
I mean, who hasn't made mistakes? 
I once french-kissed a dog at a party to try to impress what turned out to be a very tall 12-year-old. 
Lemon, we all know what mistakes are. 
I'm going to tell Colleen what's happening while you all calm down. 
Where's her room? 
(Whispering) Don't worry. 
I sent her to the east wing. 
It's very confusing. 
It was designed by M.C. Escher. 
These stairs are weird. 
Mother. 
Dinner is ready. 
What are you doing here, sir? 
I wasn't setting this up because I'm spending Christmas at work. 
I certainly wasn't going to pretend those trash cans were my parents. 
I'm here picking up a serious outfit from wardrobe for my event later. 
All the big actors do charity work on Christmas Eve. 
Russell Crowe is having an auction to benefit the victims of his own mood swings. 
So what are you doing, sir? 
Screening my very sad movie Hard to Watch at a women's shelter. 
It's gonna be real depressing. 
I hate seeing you like this, sir. 
And you ruined Ludachristmas. 
In the Darfur region, the dead may be the lucky ones. 
Next slide. 
What else can I do, Kenneth? 
People only take you seriously if you're serious. 
But comedy is just as important as drama. 
People need to laugh, especially in these tough times. 
And after all, isn't laughter the best medicine? 
Except for Insulin, spironolactone, and bupropion, which I have for you whenever you're ready, sir. 
 Mother, you look lovely. 
 I see you brought the bag that my bastard grandchild will come in. 
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Donaghy. 
My gift to you is the feeling of superiority you'll have for the next two seconds. 
Is she drunk, Jack? 
Because, you know, when you're pregnant, one bottle of wine a day, and that's it. 
Mother, you must remember Milton Greene, my father and your shameful sex secret. 
Why would you bring him here? 
Oh, I see. 
Trying to make me look like the bad guy, is that it? 
You are the bad guy. 
You kept me from my son for 50 years. 
You didn't miss much. 
He's a good boy. 
He got me a kidney... 
From Elvis Costello. 
All that time lost because of you and your pride. 
And think of what I've lost. 
Going on father-and-son habitat for humanity builds and road trips in my V.W. van. 
Yeah, or other things. 
And then you dare to judge us and our life decisions? 
Who do you think you are? 
God, this house is enormous. 
Oh, hi, Colleen. 
I tried to stop this. 
Well, mother, what do you have to say for yourself? 
It's speechless. 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas one and all. 
(Gasps) (Cell phone vibrating) Jenna, this dinner is a disaster. 
My life is ruined. 
I just came up with the perfect couple's costume for new queer's Eve, and I can't use it because of stupid Paul. 
You know what? 
The reason I'm not with my family right now is because I didn't want any drama, and that's all I'm getting, first from these "jagwagons" and now you. 
Paul is the reason you're upset. 
It's not about this party. 
It's about the party. 
I want to eat shrimp off an old gay dressed as baby new year. 
Ugh. 
(Cell phone beeps) Hi, Colleen. 
 Hmm. 
 Are you all right? 
Just thinking about my next move. 
No, no. 
What next move? 
This thing hasn't even started. 
Welcome to my Christmas Attack Zone. 
Ladies of the battered women's shelter, please be quiet, a man is talking. 
You're about to watch a film that holds a mirror up to your own terrible lives. 
You're gonna see poverty, drug abuse, and a bunch of babies having a hammer fight in a dumpster. 
Comedy is just as important... 
'Portant...'Portant... 
Laughter is the best medicine... 
Medicine...Medicine... 
Damn it. I can't get Kenneth 
out of my head. 
Actually, he's behind you, tray. 
He rode over here with us. 
You talked to him the whole ride. 
Well, he's right. 
People do need to laugh, and I'm the medicine. 
What are you doing? 
Something I should have done a long time ago. 
A long time ago? 
You just got here. 
Shut up, dotcom. 
Ladies and children, I give you The Chunks 2: A very chunky Christmas. 
(Applause) Lights. 
Damn Christmas lights blew a... 
Aah! 
(Grunting) (Laughter) Well, this has turned out to be the opposite of what I wanted, and I'm gonna leave before anything else happens. 
So... 
Oh, my God. 
My arm is numb. 
What are you doing now, mother? 
I think the stress... 
Don't go to her. 
Do you have shortness of breath? 
Are you sweating? 
Do you have a neck or jaw pain? 
I had a couple of rich men die on top of me. 
It's like something... 
Like my son sitting on my chest. 
We should call an ambulance. 
We are not calling anyone. 
What's the matter with you? 
Your mother's not well. 
Can't you see that she's faking, Milton? 
There. 
Did anybody see that? 
(Gasps) We have to call an ambulance. 
Listen to me, damn it. 
I'm a doctor. 
Of history. 
In what emergency would you be necessary... 
If someone wanted to know whether the '60s were awesome or not? 
 They were. 
 You hang in there. 
You need to meet our daughter, little Colleen. 
Seems like people are back on my side, Jackie. 
Paul, my ex-lover. 
Listen, I-I'm not here because I want to get back together. 
Good. 
Me neither. 
Can I get you a cup of coffee or an absinthe enema? 
No, thank you. 
I can't stay. 
I just wanted to let you know that I had an amazing idea for a couple's costume. 
Well, so did I. 
What's yours? 
Well, maybe we should just say them at the same time and see what happens. 
 You dress as Natalie Portman  I dress as Natalie Portman (Both) from the movie Black Swan,  and you dress  and I dress (Both) as former Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver and Pennsylvania Gubernatorial Nominee Lynn Swann. 
We're two black swans. 
Well, it is a druid solstice miracle that it wasn't a heart attack. 
Yes, I do believe a heart is required. 
That is enough, Jack. 
What happened tonight was so scary, and the reason that it happened is that we were not being honest with each other. 
So from now on, no more secrets. 
Okay. 
I'll go first. 
I have a crush on the mentalist. 
Just family only, Lemon, damn it. 
There is one more secret Jack and I have been keeping from all of you. 
We were planning to elope in the Caribbean over new year's, but now we want you all to come. 
Oh! 
How wonderful. 
You know what I learned tonight? 
As hard as you try, no one can escape the horror of Christmas, so it might as well be with your own family. 
I'm gonna go get a bus to white haven now, and I should be home just in time for aunt Linda to try to prove that she's sober by holding someone's baby while cooking. 
Listen, Jackie, everything I've ever done in life has been to protect you. 
I know. 
And if I got upset earlier, it's because I want your life to be perfect... 
Unlike mine. 
Don't let him off the hook, Colleen. 
What he did tonight was wrong, and he owes you an apology. 
He's right. 
I almost died. 
And using your father like that is so disrespectful. 
He's a doctor, for God sakes. 
Your mother and I are very disappointed in you, Jack. 
What are you smiling at, you fruitcake? 
Just my mom and dad yelling at me together. 
Milton, the Clinton boom years were just an after-effect of reaganomics, and, mother, you cannot invite anyone to the wedding. 
What happened to the heart attack? 
Let me tell you something. 
(Overlapping shouting) You insult your own intelligence. 
I'll invite anybody I want to this wedding, to this wedding or any other wedding. 
 It is the night  (Mouths words)  Of our dear savior's birth  You are a war criminal. 
I hate to say it. 
(Both)  Long lay the world   In sin and darkness pining   Till he appeared   And the soul felt his worth   A thrill of hope   The weary world rejoices   For yonder breaks   A new and glorious morn   Fall   On your knees   Oh, hear  The angel voices   Oh, night   Divine   Oh, night   When Christ was born   Oh, night   Divine   Oh, night   When Christ was born   Oh, holy night   The stars   Are brightly shining   It is the night   Of the dear savior's birth  And I hope everybody, everybody have a merry Christmas. 
And somebody needs to clean this table up. 
It's disgusting. 
Fred, wake up. 
Merry Christmas from The Chunks. 
This better be important, Jack. 
I was in the middle of bidding on a bag of bras on eBay. 
Lemon, Hank Hooper is on his way up from Philadelphia, and he wants to meet with both of us. 
Why does he want to meet me? 
Do you think it's a good thing? 
It's not, hon. 
I saw that in a movie once, but in the movie, the guy was dead. 
Nice tie, Jack. 
How long have you been there? 
I was sitting in that chair a minute ago. 
Nope. 
That was me. 
What can I say? 
I smell like leather. 
And you must be Elizabeth Lemon. 
Oh. 
Well, I'll be Bake McBrided. 
I know a Philly gal when I hug one. 
Now, Elizabeth, I like to look someone in the eye and smile when I say that what you're doing is bad. 
It's just horrible. 
Without Tracy, your show is like my cholesterol. 
The numbers are killing me. 
So I'm gonna cancel TGS. 
Hank, as you know, tonight is TGS's 100th episode. 
And we've been getting some good media buzz. 
Got on Wikipedia this week. 
So you did 99 shows against all odds and reason. 
That's something. 
 Now it's time to rest. 
 Really? 
You want to cancel the only show on your network starring a 42-year-old woman? 
A show that is number one in its time slot among men 18 to 49 months left in prison? 
I thought this company was a family, but I guess it's that Austrian family and I am the girl in the basement, and you are the dad who has been brutally Thank you, Lemon. 
What Liz is neglecting to tell you is that Tracy Jordan is back. 
Oh. 
Well, that's something. 
And I would consider it a personal favor if you would let them do the 100th episode and then reevaluate the show with Tracy in it. 
All right. 
You get one more shot. 
Just like the army doctor said to me after my weekend in Okinawa. 
You know, Jack, I'm amazed at how much you will stick your neck out for your people. 
It's no wonder you're here with us good folks at Kabletown instead of running GE. 
They're mean. 
Jack Welch once smacked a pretzel out of my hand at the Super Bowl. 
Is Tracy back? 
I'd hate to think I just lied to Hank. 
Geez, I'll get it done. 
You know I'll do whatever it takes. 
Lemon-style. 
 Everybody dance now  You gonna get me another sandwich or I'm gonna cut your face up so bad you'll have a chin. 
I will waste you! 
You'll have to go through this old bastard first. 
And I don't really think it's fair for me to be on a jury because I'm a hologram. 
What is the holdup with Tracy? 
I thought you found him. 
I did find him, but he's still crazy. 
He thinks he can't be funny anymore because now's a big Oscar winner. 
People respect him too much. 
He told me he feels like a Bartram's Scrub-Hairstreak trying to crawl back into its silky cocoon. 
Which is a butterfly metaphor, by the way, and not, as I first thought, a list of African-American hair pduducts. 
Well you just need to turn the beautiful butterfly back into  a drunk, incompetent caterpillar. 
And I have a plan. 
I booked him on every morning show in New York. 
Traci will destroy all his goodwill in time for rehearsal. 
I've been prepping him all week. 
So, Tracy Jordan, My wife Joey and I were in Maralago Jesus was black! 
Just get him back in time for the show. 
I have a very full plate. 
Really? 
Is it from that pie place? 
And I'm tired of going to bat for you and your show. 
Oh, okay. 
Fine. 
But just to be clear There is no pie. 
Okay. 
 who wears a swimsuit to Denny's?  
 that's her    that's me    that's Pam  the overly-confident, morbidly obese woman. 
I can't sit in a booth! 
And cut. 
Congratulations, everyone. 
In 100 shows, we've done Pam 107 times. 
Can you believe it's been five years since we first started doing this? 
Um, that wasn't me. 
There used to be another guy. 
I don't think so. 
Happy 100th show, miss Maroney. 
Danny and I were just talking about what an amazing five years we've had. 
I will choke you to death with your boyfriend's wig! 
Give me back my man, bitch! 
Can you reminisce about something that's happened since I've been here, 'cause I couldn't see any of that. 
I'll never forget what you said to me after that first show, miss Maroney. 
Terrific show, ma'am. 
If I know anything about television, The Girlie Show is a hit. 
Oh, please. 
If this turkey goes 100 episodes, I'll have your baby. 
I said that? 
I was so young. 
Wait. I saw that. 
How? Am I dead? 
Well, it's been 100 episodes. 
I better lay you across my grandmother's lap in the mating shed. 
But seriously, imagine if Jenna really was a mother. 
It would be horrible. 
The only thing I want latched to my funbags are celebrity DJs. 
I don't know, miss Maroney. 
I think you'd make a wonderful parent. 
You could sing the baby to sleep and tell it fairy tales and act out all the witch parts. 
You're serious? 
You albino goon. 
I wish. 
Albinos get to be watchers in the mating shed. 
I can't even imagine you pregnant. 
A picture of you in Us Weekly next to Natalie Portman in the same maternity outfit. 
"Who wore it best?" 
I did. 
I wore it best. 
A baby gets you attention. 
Listen up, friends. 
It's pep talk time. 
I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything here. 
If we don't get Tracy back and do the best show that we've ever done, we're cancelled. 
So we're counting on Tracy? 
Forget it. 
Frank, put that hat back on. 
Look, we've been through bad times before. 
All right. 
Ride it straight to hell! 
Here come the roofies. 
Where's my Mac and cheese? 
And we've had some good times. 
Who wants my puddings! 
And I know what you are all capable of. 
This is your moment. 
Tonight, TGS will not be the worst thing on television. 
It'll be John Stossel. 
Who's with me? 
Yeah! 
Let's do it. 
Good job. 
Gas leak, huh? 
Great. 
Damn it. 
Why now? 
On my last day before retirement. 
Here. Let me show you guys something. 
That's my girl. 
We're getting married when I get out of here. 
Why am I showing you guys this? 
It's gonna jinx everything. 
Plus you're a couple of pervs. 
Should be all right as long as the leak doesn't get into ah, damn it. 
Look at this. 
It's going right into the sixth floor air duct. 
Damn it again! 
Well, we're gonna have to evacuate the sixth until this thing's taken care of. 
Who's up there? 
TGS? 
Isn't that show already half-dead? 
Who wants to kiss? 
What do you say we get some fresh air? 
Jack, we´ve a problem- There's a gas leak in the studio. 
Do you know what I find fascinating? 
Mystery novels written by janitors? 
How everyone who comes through my door seems to want to talk about TGS as if it's also the only thing in my life. 
Now, I may not be the head of ge, but that doesn't mean I'm not a very busy man. 
I've got other things going on too, you know. 
See? 
I got a new hair. 
It's white and it hurts, but How bad is this leak? 
It's pretty bad. 
Prolonged exposure could lead to incapacitation or even death. 
Other possible side effects include hallucinations, revelation of secrets, telling of truths, flashbacks, headaches, nostalgia. 
Can you believe this is happening to me on my last day of work? 
My last day. 
I don't know if there was a party planned Evacuate the sixth floor. 
I don't care if anyone dies. 
I refuse to have long, gas-induced conversations with any of you people. 
Boy, you know, over the past five years, we've had a lot of crazy characters and guest stars drop by TGS. 
Thank you, Pete. 
Thank you, Pete. 
I can't believe it's been 100 shows. 
More like 100 little strokes. 
You know, The Girlie Show was working just fine, and then Jack came along and forced me to hire Tracy, and now look at us. 
Oh, life was so much simpler back then. 
I had a boyfriend. 
Dennis. 
Sure, he was an idiot, but he made great chili, and he didn't care if I watched TV during sex. 
Yeah, maybe I was better off then. 
Liz, we have to evacuate the floor. 
There's a gas leak. 
What? 
What about the show? 
Everyone, evacuate immediately. 
This is not a drill. 
The gas is not affecting me yet, so I can lead you to safety. 
Just follow these... 
Troll penises! 
Oh, God! 
What have I done? 
He is an Oscar winner for his role as D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in the movie Hard to Watch. 
Please welcome Tracy Jordan. 
Tracy! 
Tracy. 
Tracy? 
Why don't you shut your mouth, back that ass up and make me a sandwich? 
He's awesome. 
You are still in character as the verbally abusive D'Jeffrey. 
I mean, he's become such a part of him. 
So, Tracy Jordan. 
You asked to come on our show because you had a revelation about your post-Oscar trip to Africa. 
I lied to all you ugly white ladies. 
I didn't go to Africa. 
I was hiding in a warehouse in Queens, watching vintage pornography. 
I love your honesty. 
It's because you didn't feel like your authentic self that you walked away from success. 
That's actually very brave. 
Don't you think? 
No! It's unbrave! 
 You should hate me! 
 I can't. 
You fly free. 
I'm a bird in a cage. 
Hey, you got to stay around. 
We've got our no-cook cooking, hair make-unders. 
What does that even mean? 
It's new haircuts, but you can make salads with them. 
A true artist... 
He feels things we don't. 
This is Today on NBC. 
No, we can't do another Pam. 
Not tonight. 
Frank, what is this? 
"Broken eyboard alk show"? 
I write what I know. 
Also I broke my keyboard. 
No, we're throwing everything out and starting over. 
Only home runs, guys. 
Focus up. 
It's just hard to concentrate. 
It's so nice working outside. 
Tracy, how'd it go? 
Are you on your way back? 
It was a disaster! 
What happened? 
What about our plan? 
I'm so beloved, I can do no wrong. 
Now everyone's after me. 
Unicef, the Gates foundation. 
And what is Farm Aid? 
Is it a drink? 
Is it a drug? 
Is it a bandage you put on a barn? 
See, that's the kind of lazy stand-up I'll never do again. 
Tracy, just come back, do the show tonight, and we'll figure all this out. 
F-u, l.l. 
Spells "full," because you're full of BS, Liz Lemon. 
Listen to me. 
There's still time. 
The media won't let you embarrass yourself. 
Be like Michael McDonald and take it to the streets. 
Get the public to hate you, and the media will follow. 
And then you'll get your old life back. 
Trust me. 
You better be right, Liz Lemon, 'cause I can't take much more of this. 
I think Bono got in my limo. 
Liz! 
Do you think I'd be a good mother? 
No. 
And I wasn't even drinking anything. 
I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I'm starting to have this real desire to nurture... my career. 
I think pregnancy would be a great PR move. 
Oh, my God. 
You want a baby to help your career? 
Look... TGS may be going away. 
Being pregnant is a great excuse for why I stopped working instead of the truth. 
I'm in my 40s, very difficult, and not that good at playing La Realite. 
Jenna, think about this. 
You will have a child. 
Who will grow up to be a little gay fancy man. 
Well, good luck finding a man willing to ride that crazy train. 
I'll have you know I talked with a man this morning who thinks I'd be a wonderful mother. 
He must be an idiot. 
He is an idiot. 
What about a sketch about how the Empire State building is controlling us with electricity? 
Come on, get out of here. 
Just maybe one more turn. 
Then I can go home to my sweetheart. 
I told her boy I'd hit a home run for him tomorrow night. 
Here we go. 
Damn it! 
I'm getting too old for this "shh" sound that comes from this gas pipe. 
Who are you? 
You're so handsome. 
I'm Jack Donaghy, CEO of General Electric. 
Who are you? 
I'm Jack Donaghy. 
You were Jack Donaghy. 
You were magnificent. 
 I'm still magnificent. 
 No. 
I come from an alternate universe in which I followed our plan for world domination. 
I run the general. 
I own an NFL team. 
I guest-starred on Entourage. 
What do you do? 
I'll tell you what I don't do. 
Wear a striped tie with a striped shirt. 
It's called "Power Clashing" and I do it because I can. 
I wore this on the January cover of Meetings magazine. 
We made the cover during meetings history month? 
I made the cover. 
What happened to you, Jack? 
You were supposed to spend six months in tv as part of your climb up the GE ladder. 
You've been here five years. 
And here... 
Isn't even GE anymore. 
It's Kableclown. 
"Town," Donaghy, and that's not funny. 
It was funny when I said it on my syndicated radio show. 
You bastard. 
I'm doing fine! 
You used to be a shark. 
I still am. 
Look at my claws! 
Sharks don't have claws. 
You don't even know what a shark is anymore! 
Oh, God. 
Do you know why? 
No. 
Liz... Lemon. 
Lemon? 
She became your focus at the expense of your own ambition. 
You should have realized within a week that Lemon was a black hole, unworthy of our mentorship. 
And now it's five years later, and what are you doing? 
Are you building factories in bangalore? 
Are you dining in the Palin White House? 
No. 
You're approving TGS wrap gifts. 
Baseball caps with stupid sayings from the show written on them. 
What the hell is a "Pwomp"? 
It's when two fat people I don't care! 
What's happened to you? 
To us? 
We make me sick. 
Mr. Donaghy? 
 What? 
 Yes, Tom? 
The gas leak has spread to this floor. 
You got to clear out before you start seeing things. 
 Thank you, tom. 
 I'll clear you out! 
Oh, okay. 
The real Jack Donaghy could handle a little gas leak! 
I am a Jedi! 
Hey, look. 
Tracy Jordan is ironically reappropriating his bad past behavior as a commentary on Fitzgerald's dictum that there are no second acts in American life. 
I want to take a picture of him with my old-fashioned camera. 
 No! No! 
 Ah! 
Help! 
I can't swim! 
Damn it! 
He just pulled me out of the water and said, "Don't tell anyone I did this." 
I didn't even get a chance to congratulate him on his Oscar. 
Modesty and heroism. 
Two words forever synonymous with Tracy Jordan. 
"Tracy Jordan saves drowning man"? 
Ah, come on! 
Why is Tracy off rescuing people? 
Why isn't he here? 
He will be, I promise. 
And we need to be ready. 
Lutz, what are you working on? 
Breathing through my mouth so I don't smell the throw-up on s shirt. 
I would take my shirt off, but I visited my rescue chimp for his birthday last week, and another chimp got mad and bit my nipple off. 
He played with it, and then he kissed it, and then he ate it. 
Damn it, lutz. 
Focus up. 
Where's my computer? 
Cerie, did you not bring my computer down? 
You said you were writing. 
I've only seen you use that computer to look at pictures of Nate Berkus. 
Ah! Pwomp! 
Hey, Jack, you're friends with Jeter and Springsteen, right? 
Can you call and see if they'll be in the cold open? 
They'd have to kiss. 
Oh, really, Lemon? 
You still need my help? 
Five years of my business life wasted, and I'm still supposed to hold your hand. 
Your wet, yet somehow flaky hand. 
 What just happened? 
 You happened. 
Sideways Jack was right. 
Sideways what? 
In here! 
Did you also have to evacuate the NBC Store? 
No, it's just empty. 
This TV nonsense was supposed to be my stepping stone, and instead, it's my gravestone. 
And do you know whose fault that is? 
Sort of feel like you're gonna say Leno. 
You. 
I got so sucked into trying to repair you that I became the American auto industry, failing to recognize that you can't fix a Lemon Wow, yeah, because the last five years have been so great for me with you as my mentor. 
I was better off before we met. 
So what's your point, Lemon? 
You'd rather be doing The Girlie Show and going home to Dennis? 
I didn't say that. 
But at least Dennis was always there for me. 
He's the only guy I can say that about. 
I dragged you down? 
Opposite! 
I should have gone with my gut and fired you when we first met. 
What? 
Flashback, please. 
Uh, Pete, hang back. 
Yeah, you bet. 
We have a problem. 
I can explain. 
My zipper broke. 
I don't think Liz Lemon's female voice is a good match for Tracy Jordan. 
Firing Lemon will send a message to the whole staff. 
No, no, you can't fire Liz. 
This show is her life. 
She hasn't got much going on. 
She threw a birthday party for her TV. 
If you fire Liz, then then I quit. 
You'll never succeed by sticking your neck out for someone like her. 
But if that's how you feel, so be it. 
The important thing is that I fire someone... 
Pete. 
You tried to fire me? 
And then a week later, you're like, "oh, I want to mentor you." 
"Unlikely friendship." 
Who do you think you are? 
I'll tell you who I was. 
That guy that fired Pete. 
And he could have run GE, but instead, he got lemoned. 
I should have fired you from my life. 
I knew you were supposed to push, but I didn't say anything. 
Ugh. 
Mmm. 
The MSG is delicious today. 
I'm so glad that you're able to meet me on my break. 
Is this just to talk, or will you be activating my electric underwear? 
Just to talk. 
Paul, do you think I'd be a good mother? 
Of course not. 
And I'd be a terrible father. 
I mean, what if we had a child that was prettier than us? 
We'd have to leave it in a desert. 
But Kenneth thinks I'd make a good mother. 
Oh. 
Is that something you want? 
Wasn't something I thought about until Kenneth said I'd be good at it. 
And of course, it'd be great for my career. 
Everyone would talk about my crazy name choice. 
Right now, it's between "Frisbeeface" and "Glock," gender irrelevant. 
I love you, Jenna Maroney. 
I want to hogtie you and hide you in the luggage compartment of a Greyhound bus with just a bowl of dirty water. 
I love you too. 
But I don't know. 
I mean, Kenneth Parcell may be the only man in the world who thinks you should have a child. 
Break's over, Paul. 
Crew meeting in Lady Chantarelle's office. 
He's pissed. 
 Hey, dummy. 
 Gah! What? 
Whoa. 
You look good. 
You lose weight or something? 
Your neck, it looks looser. 
What are you doing here, Dennis? 
I got your message. 
What message? 
Dennis, it's dummy. 
I miss you. 
Come see me. 
Things were better five years ago, Jack. 
I was in my 30s and everything. 
Whazzup! 
You've reached Dennis' voicemail. 
"How you doing?" 
Get out of here, Joey. 
I'm recording my voicemail message. 
Is that real? 
Okay, I did call you, but I was not in my right mind. 
I mean, how could I be, to call you after everything you've done? 
Good evening, sir. 
I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC. 
Can I ask you what you're doing here tonight? 
Yeah, I'm here to boff some chick named Mary. 
Hey... threesome? 
How about it, huh? 
It's Tonya, right? 
It's wonderful service. 
Could you maybe not hit on the waitress in front Chew and screw! 
Run, dummy. 
Ah! 
Damn it, Dennis! 
I checked a coat. 
But you called me, Liz. 
Oh, whatever. 
'Cause down deep, you still got all kinds of queer feelings for me. 
That's why I knew someday you'd be all vulnerable from a gas leak or a coma or a super period. 
You're disgusting. 
And I would be there for you. 
No. You know what I feel? 
You were a mistake that I made at a time in my life when I could afford to make mistakes. 
That's what I miss, Dennis, not you. 
Okay, gang, they fixed the gas leak. 
They're airing out the studio. 
We can start heading back up. 
Whoa, hold on a second. 
You think I'm just gonna give up now, huh? 
I'm a Duffy, Liz and us Duffys, we didn't give up when we got kicked out of Ireland. 
We didn't give up when America sent us back. 
And we didn't give up when Ireland then just set us adrift on a log, all right? 
Come on, it's not over, Liz. 
What a day! 
Miss Lemon's gonna get Mr. Jordan back. 
We're gonna do the best show ever. 
And out on the Plaza, a bird landed on my apple. 
I thought he was gonna eat it, but he just sat there. 
What's next? 
A different bird landing on a different apple? 
Where are you, Tray? 
 I'm back, Liz Lemon. 
 Tracy's back!! 
 Yeah! 
 Yes! 
I'm gonna need an Obama cold open, a fart doctor, and you know what? 
Write up that bum's Empire State building idea. 
Fart doctor. 
No, I mean I'm back to where I was yesterday. 
I can't get anyone mad at me. 
I even called a woman's basketball team "Nappy-headed hos," but apparently, I'm allowed to talk like that. 
Why? 
Tracy, come on. 
Tracy Jordan? 
Why isn't he here? 
I just had a meeting with News down on four. 
Brian Williams sure gets close to you when he talks. 
Very feminine energy. 
Anyway, I thought I'd just swing by and introduce myself to Tracy Jordan, but Ah! 
He-- he is here. 
You know, he just likes to learn his lines in the bathroom and communicate by phone. 
Actors, am I right? 
You know, I once had to speak to the Screen Actors Guild. 
Bunch of nutjobs. 
But you couldn't make movies and TV without 'em. 
I'm just kidding! 
I mean, look at March of the Penguins. 
Who was in that? 
Good luck tonight. 
You're gonna need it. 
Tracy, you can do this. 
You have to be at the show tonight. 
Tracy who? 
I don't even know who I am anymore. 
Look, you think the world has turned its back on you? 
I know a place where that's not true. 
A place where you can remember the man you used to be. 
A place where you can eat buffet ribs while someone's daughter shakes her crack at you. 
Tracy Jordan, I am taking you to a strip club. 
Oh, excuse me, miss. 
How much is a lap dance? 
I'm a little light on cash, but I have a PayPal account. 
Oh, my God. 
Tracy Jordan? 
That's right. 
Party time. 
When I saw you in Hard to Watch... 
No, no, keep it light. 
You inspired me to contact my biological father. 
No daddy stuff. 
I hadn't spoken to him in 13 years. 
Maybe show him your butt. 
There are tears falling on her boobies, Liz Lemon. 
I know you've been molested. 
That's how we all got here, but I don't want to hear about it. 
I just wanted to let you know that I'm going into the Navy. 
Because like you said in your movie, "I invent my tomorrow." 
But I wasn't even supposed to say that. 
The line was, "Shereen, I hope Dr. Mogutu has good news 
"about my endoscopy," but I couldn't get it right, so they told me to improv. 
Come on, guys. 
I'm making it rain. 
You see what you've done, Liz Lemon? 
Tracy Jordan is broken. 
It's over. 
Get off stage! 
No whites! 
You wanted to see me, miss Maroney? 
Oh, my. 
Candles, incense, Disco music. 
Someone's getting into the easter spirit. 
No, Kenneth. 
Do you remember that silly joke about me having your baby? 
Yes. 
 So crazy. 
 I know. 
It's crazy... 
Unless you're into it. 
What? 
No, ma'am. 
That would be wrong. 
We're not married. 
And we're different religions. 
We can do whatever we want. 
Miss Maroney, I'd do anything for you or mr. Jordan, 
but this is wrong. 
But, Kenneth, you might be my only chance. 
No! 
Fine. I'll get you 
when you're sleeping. 
It's not rape if neither party really wants it. 
You're back. 
Yeah, and this is my front. 
Thanks for setting me up with another classic quote. 
I borrowed your whale semen candle. 
It didn't work, by the way. 
You can keep it. 
I'm just packing up a few things, and then I'm gone. 
Wait. 
Where are you going? 
I'm quitting show business. 
I can't stop the horrible respect people have for me. 
Tracy, you can't do that. 
Look, I would never say this on the record. 
Of course. 
This is all off the record. 
The show needs you, and I need you. 
I'd rather do the show than have a baby. 
 But you don't understand. 
 Oh, I do understand. 
Look at Roman Polanski. 
No, thank you. 
Or Elia Kazan. 
He told the government his friends were communists, then got a standing ovation at the Oscars. 
That's crazy. 
A man named "Elia." 
That's a giraffe's name. 
You know, when you think about it, the only celebrities who completely undo their goodwill are the murderers. 
John Wilkes Booth, Phil Spector, OJ Simpson, who texted me earlier today. 
Shoot someone, huh? 
Nah. That's crazy, even for us 
I guess it would take a pretty big gas leak to make you think that was a good idea. 
All right! 
100th episode, 100 hours of comedy. 
Minus the commercials. 
20 hours of comedy. 
 Hey, dummy. 
 Damn it. 
Look, Liz, if this is gonna work out between you and me, you should know my tarantula sleeps on my face. 
Oh, my God. 
My show is getting cancelled, I'm never speaking to Jack Donaghy again, and the worst thing that happened to me today is that you showed up. 
Ah, 'cause you called me. 
When I was high on gas. 
Do you not understand what that means? 
No, not really. 
Gas has no effect on me at all. 
When I was growing up, my school, Gerry cooney elementary, it was right next to a gas works in Queens. 
It ventilated into the Cafeteria. 
We got a big settlement from the city. 
Our parents voted to spend it on a boat that the families could share, but then that sank. 
But you know what? 
I'm still smart enough to know that I'll never do better than you, Liz Lemon, 'cause you're a cook in the bedroom and a whore in the kitchen. 
So I'm gonna give you one more shot to admit to me that you keep bringing me back into your life for a reason. 
Subhas, take out the trash. 
Don't order me around, woman. 
No, I mean just Dennis, get out. 
You'll change your mind. 
Let's rock, Duffy. 
You again! 
Wait a minute... 
 You're not Sideways Jack! 
 I'm Past Jack. 
Because I'm from the past? 
And I'm you? 
 Yeah, get it. 
 Do you? 
'Cause it seems like you don't get much of anything anymore, old man. 
If you're my future, I'm gonna jump. 
Stop him! 
If he jumps, we don't exist anymore. 
I'm perfectly aware of that. 
I studied time dilation and quantum teleportation in college. 
No, you didn't. 
You saw Time Cop. 
Really? 
I never saw Time Cop. 
You will in 2007, and you'll love it. 
Why are you talking like that? 
This is how everyone talked in the '80s. 
This is how Reagan talked. 
Look, there's still time to fix this, Jack. 
You need to kick ass again, starting with getting rid of that woman. 
Listen to him. 
He's awesome, and you know he's right. 
Fire Lemon? 
I don't know if I can do that. 
Well, then, take this! 
Oh, God! 
That only hurt me. 
Why did I think that would hurt you too? 
Jack, be the man you were meant to be. 
Me. 
This tuxedo is made out of the Puma that I rode into my 50th birthday party. 
Why are you both wearing tuxedos? 
It's after 6:00. 
What are we, farmers? 
Now go get rid of that woman. 
Just want to check everything out after your little gas scare. 
Well, my pen light is working. 
That's good. 
Now, can you say the alphabet for me? 
Well, a very, very heavy uh, heavy, du bertation tonight. 
We had a very dairse dareson by let's go ahead and tersh-tayson lets gotobit anhaddapit. 
Excellent. 
My God, Jenna. 
Are you pregnant? 
How? 
Did you go swimming in a public pool? 
No, I got in my head about having a baby, and now I'm having a hysterical pregnancy. 
Well, that's redundant. 
All pregnancies are hysterical. 
They're started by penises. 
This should be perfect. 
I mean, all I want is the attention. 
So why am I not happy? 
I mean, on some level, do I want to have a baby? 
Do I want to be a mother? 
Should I be a mother? 
Bored! 
Hey. 
Greta Johannsen, your animal wrangler. 
My God, you're beautiful. 
 if you say good-bye tonight   all I'll have will be my memories   so keep on reaching for the light   I now believe these are my memories   my memories  Mr. Jordan, I refuse 
to accept this is happening. 
You leaving is as crazy to me as evolution, or a woman's right to choose her haircut. 
I'm sorry, Ken, but maybe Jenna was right. 
The only way I could come back is if I shoot someone, and that's crazy. 
Or is it? 
Maybe it's a good idea. 
I don't know. 
It has a nice, simple logic to it. 
Why don't we take a deep breath and then both say what we think we should do. 
 You should shoot me... 
 I should shoot you... 
 on the roof of 30 Rock! 
 on the roof of 30 Rock! 
I only ask one thing, sir. 
Make it quick. 
I cannot promise you that, Ken. 
I'm a horrible shot. 
To the roof. 
 Hey, dummy. 
 Hey. 
You ready to sign that lease? 
You know how we were talking earlier about me moving in with you and how hard it is to kick a tenant out in New York? 
Just think about it. 
I'll make you chili every night. 
I'll provide for you. 
I have a new business idea. 
It's like Netflix, but you go to a store, and you pick out your video from a limited selection. 
 It'd be like five years ago. 
 Exactly. 
I can move my stuff in tonight, right? 
I just have one duffel bag in a sidecar. 
My motorcycle got impounded from being parked too awesome. 
I just need you to sign this lease I printed up off the Internet. 
Okay, I need a pen. 
You don't have a pen? 
You're a writer, Liz. 
All I have is this kick-ass laser pointer that I point at nerds' crotches in the park. 
Oh, wait. 
All we have is this kick-ass laser pointer. 
Come on, baby. 
Let's go find a pen. 
Okay. 
Oh, no. 
Let me introduce myself. 
I am Future Jack, obviously. 
Is that what we're wearing in ten years? 
More like 35 years. 
You're 87 years old? 
My God, I'm outstanding. 
I like to think so. 
I've come all the way from the future which is a lot harder than coming from the past Whatever, pops. 
To warn you not to listen to the other Jacks. 
In the future, you're happier than you ever imagined. 
You have grandchildren and a gorgeous Polyblasian wife. 
That's a new race that emerges in 2030. 
They're incredible. 
 What happened to Avery? 
 Oh, you'll see. 
It's hilarious. 
Yeah, but what about his, your, our career? 
Don't we wanna be this dude? 
Younger me's, business is only a part of life. 
 Real happiness... 
 Ah, shut up. 
Don't listen to his crap, Jack. 
If you choose my path, you'll be plenty happy. 
You'll spearhead GE's development of the electric vagina. 
You won't be married, but you'll have a house with a lot of glass, and it's cold. 
And you'll own the Buffalo Bills. 
You didn't say it was the Bills. 
Look, right now, Liz Lemon is downstairs about to sign a lease with Dennis Duffy. 
If she does that, you'll lose her. 
In three years, they'll be married and living in Jacksonville, Florida, where he operates an unlicensed alligator park. 
Jacksonville? 
Her hair can't handle that humidity. 
No, I don't care. 
I'm tired of saving her. 
To quote Liz Lemon, "Opposite!" 
You'd be saving yourself. 
The only way to get my life is to be distracted from your blind ambition, and you can't do that without Liz Lemon in your life. 
Jack, this guy is just trying to justify his own bad choices. 
Go down there and fire Liz. 
Okay. 
We're obviously all thinking it, so I'm just gonna say it. 
We're gonna have sex with each other, right? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 Oh, my! 
Lemon, don't sign that lease! 
 Why are you here? 
 Just sign it, dummy. 
It's a receipt for some lez pants  you bought or whatever. 
 No. 
If you have a problem, I will fight you, Dennis. 
That wouldn't be very fair. 
I'm only trained to fight four or more men at a time. 
There are three more of me upstairs, and I'd be happy to go get them. 
I can't. 
I hurt my wrist. 
Hey, people. 
Somebody sabotaged the gas line. 
People could've died or had fights. 
What? 
Who would do that? 
Hey, grab that black guy. 
It was you. 
What are you, mad at me, Liz? 
Huh? 
I did it for love. 
You're insane. 
Hey, hey, hey, guys. 
Hands off the jacket, all right? 
It's from Amar'e Stoudemire's eveningwear collection. 
If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. 
Please. 
You'll be back. 
All right, the gas is clearing out. 
It should be okay in time for the show. 
According to my device here. 
Good work, Jennifer. 
Oh, my God, the show. 
I gotta load in an audience. 
I gotta distribute scripts. 
I gotta change Jenna's blood. 
I need Kenneth. 
Forget about Kenneth. 
I told Hank Cooper that Tracy Jordan would be here. 
Where is the star of your show? 
Right here. 
I know you're talking about Tracy, but I don't care. 
Tracy and Kenneth went to the roof with a gun. 
Why? 
Because I gave Tracy the idea to kill the only man who would ever have a baby with me. 
 Nothing to see here, Mr. man. 
 No, sir. 
Hello, Kabletown family members. 
And my favorite actress, Jenna. 
When TGS gets cancelled, I mean if, when TGS gets cancelled, we need to talk about your future. 
I know what my future holds, Hank. 
Motherhood. 
It's a surprise to me, but I have so much love to give. 
Well, why couldn't you be a mother and do a daytime talk show? 
Well, because the talk show will be my baby. 
I'm not gonna be held back by some uterus turd. 
Let's call my agent. 
Oh, my God. 
Your stomach. 
For some reason, I'm starting to rethink this, sir. 
We all have doubt, k-tel records. 
But we made a decision. 
And we'll look stupid if we don't follow through. 
Okay. 
Just please tell my mother My bad. 
That was an accident. 
Tracy, stop! 
Don't startle me when I'm holding a gun. 
Use your head, Liz Lemon. 
For God's sakes, Tracy, give me that gun! 
Ugh! 
Do you have any idea how much paperwork I would have to do if you shot Kenneth? 
I didn't know that, Jack. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm just trying to get people to stop respecting me. 
Tracy, you want to destroy the goodwill you have so you can go back to your easy TV job? 
Yes, even more than I want to shoot Kenneth. 
Then all you have to do is go back to your easy TV job. 
 What? 
 Do TV. 
And no one will ever take you seriously again. 
Doesn't matter how big a movie star you are, even if you have the kind of career where you walked away from a blockbuster franchise or worked with Meryl Streep or Anthony Hopkins, made important movies about things like civil rights or Pearl Harbor, stole films with supporting roles and then turned around and blew them away on Broadway. 
None of that will matter once you do television. 
You could win every award in sight and be the biggest thing on the small screen, and you'll still get laughed out of the Vanity Fair Oscar party. 
by Greg Kinnear. 
Tracy, your career hit rock bottom the first time you decided to do TGS. 
You want it to hit rock bottom again? 
Go on Network television. 
Let's make some TV! 
 Yeah. 
 We have five minutes! 
Whoa, whoa, uh-uh. 
Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
I'm sorry, folks. 
While we were working on the gas line, we somehow broke the elevator. 
She's an old building. 
You're gonna have to take the stairs. 
I'm okay! 
Least I made it through my last day. 
Darn it. 
Excuse me. 
The elevators are out. 
 Do you know how  Shut up, Garkle. 
Well, if it isn't Jack and Kenneth and Tracy and Liz. 
Hey, I have a bone to pick with the four of you. 
Screw, Williams! 
Hey, get out of my home! 
Sorry, recurring hobos. 
  I'm back, everybody. 
You're welcome... 
For the adventure... 
My absence... 
Whew... 
Provided. 
30 seconds. 
Liz, I was checking the cue cards, and we have a problem. 
It all seemed so funny when they were writing it. 
During Dennis' gas leak. 
Yes, this'll work. 
Just flip the top of act two. 
Danny can't make the wardrobe change that quick. 
Best show ever! 
Yeah! 
Guys, I don't know about this. 
Oh, my God. 
We don't have a show. 
 Ten seconds. 
 Just start. 
I should call Dennis. 
Let's meet our contestants. 
Dr. Steven Poop is 
a homemaker and a centaur. 
You did it. 
You're picked up for a million more episodes. 
Where am I? 
Am I back in Vietnam? 
What charity are you playing for? 
The Grimace Foundation, Jeremy. 
Keeping milkshakes purple for over a million years. 
Hold on. 
Tracy's back on TV again? 
Clooney, Hanks. 
Actor emergency. 
Tracy Jordan's doing TV again. 
I know, disappointing. 
Take him off the official A-list. 
Well, I don't have the password. 
Pitt's our webmaster. 
Well, then, wake him up. 
Oh, they're doing Pam again? 
Ugh. 
 I don't care what you say anymore   this is my life   go ahead with your own life   leave me alone  This may be the gas talking, but I was wrong about Dennis. 
You're the guy who never left. 
And this is definitely the gas talking, but I'd be a lot worse off if I'd never met you, Lemon, and I'm proud to have you as a mentee. 
I mean, look at you. 
Endangering the lives of hundreds of people for a show that TV Guide once called "still on." 
I framed that article. 
To 100 more episodes. 
Wow, five years... 
It makes you think about all the fun we've had together. 
But you know the single most amazing thing that's happened over the last five years? 
That is true, sir. 
But today does make me wonder where we'll all be five years from now. 
We need to talk. 
Right now! 
We know Tracy is not in Africa. 
He's hiding somewhere in New York. 
 What? 
 Don't play stupid, Walter. 
We have ways of making people talk. 
By giving them fresh apple slices. 
Listen to me very carefully. 
This show is my life. 
I need Tracy back. 
Where is he? 
You think we don't want him back? 
Do you know how much our Cobra payments are? 
And he's the only one that knows the combination to the candy safe. 
The worst part is being able to see the candy. 
All right. 
But if I find out you're holding out on me, I will no longer allow you to use my office for your history club. 
That's ironic, because next week's topic is fascism. 
What about grizz and dot com? 
They don't know anything. 
Neither does anyone Tracy's close to... 
his wife, Charles Barkley, Edward James Almost, who is an Edward James Olmos lookalike  that Tracy is friends with. 
 Kenneth talks to Tracy on Skype, doesn't he? 
Just call him. 
It doesn't work that way. 
Tracy only contacts Kenneth on special occasions like Bastille Day. 
I'm going to go ahead and assume that Bastille is a stripper. 
As well you should. 
Now there's a chance he may call tomorrow because it's his lizard's birthday. 
Has it really been a year since we were all at the Waldorf eating that cake made out of lizard meal? 
Yup. Jeremy's almost 11. 
For now, our only lead is the pizza box that we saw Tracy eating from. 
We traced the phone number to a pizzeria in Queens. 
Listen to me. 
I sound like Cagney and Lacey, but without the slutty clothes. 
You have to find him, Lemon. 
Your show works with Tracy. 
And this morning, I figured out how to fix NBC. 
We will only do shows that work. 
That's nonsense. 
Do you know what the business model is in the entertainment industry? 
Make ten shows and hope that one of them works. 
We produce more failed pilots than the French air force. 
$15 million so far developing a show called Who Nose? 
about an investigative reporter who can't smell and has to get the story using only his eyes, ears, and other senses. 
You underestimated me, congressman, because I can't smell. 
But you made one mistake. 
You let me see the documents. 
So from now on, no more throwing good money after bad. 
Only what works. $10 million 
developing Dad 2.0? 
Not on my watch. 
Your father may be gone, but before he died, he programmed me to take his place. 
No. Shut it down. 
This is terrible. 
So what's going on? 
Is Tracy coming back or what? 
Well, I don't know. 
Well, what do you know? 
What do you even do? 
I'm the producer of the show. 
Right, that's what your wife told me in the shower this morning. 
All right, well, we're all having fun, and it's important that we all be able to laugh together. 
Yeah, we're not laughing with you. 
We're laughing at you, you bald bitch. 
Yes, Reggie, I am bald. 
I lost my hair at a very early age when I hit that Gypsy's kid with my car, but I am still your boss. 
Hey, bald bitch. 
Hey, that's you. 
 No, I get it. 
 He's being you. 
Yeah, I get it. 
I get it. 
Listen up, fives. 
A ten is speaking. 
As you may have heard, the Jennababy dolls I've been selling on QVC have been recalled. 
Apparently they were just being used to smuggle cocaine into the country from Mexico. 
And that's caused some problems. 
Let's just go to soccer practice now. 
I mean right now. 
Yes. It's 4:00 in the morning. 
Let's do it. 
We own this town. 
Jennababies were my backup if TGS gets cancelled, but don't worry because I have a backup to my backup. 
We don't ever worry about you. 
We don't think about you. 
That's right, Frank. 
I booked a movie. 
It's called Take my Hand. 
It's kind of an artsy character study about a young woman who has a lot of holes drilled into her head by a deranged veterinarian named Slaughterface. 
Oh, so you're doing a torture porn thing like Saw. 
Exactly. In fact, 
the producers of this movie rented Saw and watched it. 
So let me know if Tracy comes back. 
Until then, I will be in Stamford, Connecticut. 
We're shooting there for tax reasons. 
On an unrelated matter, does anyone know where I can get intimate bleaching done in Stamford, Connecticut? 
Anyone? 
I'm leaving to do a movie, Pete. 
What? No! 
You can't do that. 
That's what your wife told me in the shower this morning. 
Ha. 
Can we order lunch from Ikea? 
What? 
No. 
I'm the producer. 
I'm picking lunch today. 
Okay. 
We'll have a contest of strength to decide who gets to pick lunch. 
Who's next? 
Welcome to Federici's. 
What can I get for you guys? 
Well, as hard as it is to believe, given our apparent ages, this is my son. 
 Seems about right. 
 Okay, good. 
My son is currently studying at a local pizza academy. 
Really? Which one? 
New York Pizza Academy. 
Well, then I hate you, 'cause I'm a Pizza Academy of New York man. 
Wonderful. 
So what fraternity are you pledging? 
I'm not. 
There are no fraternities at New York Pizza Academy. 
That's right. You correctly 
answered my trick question. 
Now I'm bound by pizza academy tradition to grant you any request. 
Wow, this could not have gone any better. 
We need to see all your delivery receipts from the last two months. 
Oh, you got that delivery receipt exam coming up, huh? 
What a bear. 
Here you go. 
Take your time. 
I'll be in the back trying to think of other ways to help you. 
Well, this is obviously a dead end. 
Yeah! 
Eat your weakness. 
Congratulations. 
According to the transitive property, you just defeated Muammar Qaddafi in arm wrestling. 
Yes! 
This would have bothered me in my 20s. 
Pete, how are you so good at that? 
I don't know. 
I never work out. 
Paula! 
Here comes the big girl. 
She's got a clarinet. 
Pete, lunch is your pick. 
Takeout from Hooters. 
What? 
That makes no sense. 
We'll know they touched it. 
No one's coming to save you. 
Oh, God. 
Who are you? 
Cut! 
I just got a text from the studio. 
We're shutting down production. 
 What? 
 But I turned down Carousel  at the Goodspeed for this. 
 I'm sorry, Dana, but our budget depends on getting a tax break from Connecticut, and they say we're not portraying the State in a positive light. 
How are we not doing that, Shawn? 
I'm a little baffled over here. 
Yeah, no, it's just that we're spending taxpayer money saying there's a veterinarian running around Connecticut trying to make a house out of breasts for the Governor to live in. 
But there's a positive message at the end of it. 
If you're a woman in Connecticut, Slaughterface will kill you. 
This must be it. 
Yes, ma'am. 
There have been several deliveries to this address of Mr. Jordan's 
signature order... 
large cheese pizza with one slice taken out so I can pretend I'm eating pac-man like my hero Blinky the ghost. 
I hear someone coming. 
Well, well, well. 
You found me. 
After I ordered Thai food and gave you this address. 
Yeah? 
I'm sorry. I thought 
my friend was living here. 
And my best friend. 
Oh, is this awkward? 
Because I'm your best friend, but you're not my best friend? 
No. 
No one living here. 
At least not since we moved in two weeks ago. 
Wait a minute. Was that stuff 
here when you moved in? 
A copy of Black Yachts magazine and a Rubik's cube that has been smashed out of anger. 
Mr. Jordan was here. 
So what, Kenneth? 
These guys have been here for two weeks. 
Tracy could be anywhere. 
We're never gonna find him, TGS is gonna get cancelled, and then what? 
Can I work here? 
I'll do anything. 
I'll get in my bra, and you could throw nails at me. 
I'll dance for you. 
Miss Lemon. 
Don't panic. 
We have other options. 
But for instance... 
Mr. Jordan! 
Where are you? 
Come back! 
For the love of God, come back or we'll die! 
Jack, can we talk? 
One ten to another. 
I'm an 11, but continue. 
Me, my ass double, and a drill that once appeared on Home Improvement are currently starring in a feature film called Take my Hand. 
Really? Years ago, 
Universal had a project by that name. 
It was a romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Dempsey. 
Reese Witherspoon's just a likeable version of me. 
Then she dropped out, and it was rewritten as a buddy comedy with Dempsey and Josh Hartnett. 
But everyone fell asleep during the table read, so we moved it over to Telemundo where they tried to turn it into a variety show hosted by a supermodel and a soccer ball with a mustache. 
I met that soccer ball once at a no-hands-allowed sex party. 
Then after another round of rewrites, it was picked up by our low-budget thriller, high-budget porno division, Splatterflix, and now it's a horror movie starring "any blonde actress." 
Thank you. 
Wait, that's our project? 
This is exactly what I was talking to Lemon about. 
Three years, millions on rewrites, $20,000 in first-class flights for the drill. 
And we still have nothing to show for it. 
And we never will. 
We just got shut down because Connecticut's being a douche bag. 
They won't give us a tax break unless the movie promotes tourism. 
Then we make the movie pro-Connecticut. 
We are not losing any more money on Take my Hand. 
Okay, we just need to hire some of those ugly people who have the paper and change the shapes on it. 
Writers? 
No. 
We'll do the work ourselves. 
Meet me in my dressing room. 
I'll get a computer from one of the ugly people. 
And I'll bring the world's greatest encyclopedia... 
my mind. 
Hey, is that a to-do list? 
'Cause if your wife's on there, I've already taken care of her. 
I challenge you to the wrestling of arms. 
 What? 
 Arm wrestling. 
On the stage. 
Midnight. 
In front of everyone. 
How about tomorrow? 
Seems like it would be more convenient for people. 
I'll meet you anytime, anywhere. 
I just have to work around a PTA meeting at 5:00 that I can't miss, 'cause, this week, I'm snack dad. 
Lemon, you look terrible. 
And I once watched you eat oysters while you had a cold. 
We had him, Jack, and we lost him. 
So Kenneth and I had to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to think like Tracy. 
I ended up eating a swordfish dinner at a strip club, and Kenneth grabbed a cop's gun and shot a blimp. 
Well, tomorrow's another day, so go home, have a glass of wine, and watch a show about wedding cake disasters. 
I can't go home, Jack. 
TGS goes away if I don't find Tracy. 
I'm gonna wait up and hope that he calls his lizard. 
Did you make sure that Tracy wasn't pretending to be his own wax figure at Madame Tussauds? 
Yes. 
There was some confusion, and I ended up punching the real Levar Burton. 
I'm gonna go get Jeremy. 
I hope he's not still in heat. 
He has gotten my top off before. 
Here you go. 
Did you know that Connecticut is home to the oldest public library in the United States? 
Huh. Could you use that 
to motivate Slaughterface sewing the sheriff's mouth to his own anus? 
Of course. Elegant. 
Should vaginatorium be capitalized? 
Oh! 
I cannot wait to humiliate that guy in front of all of his meathead buddies. 
You're like a new man, Pete. 
Yeah, I am. 
Last night, I had sex with Paula, and neither of us was wearing a walkman. 
Oh, yeah. 
Why are you picking him up now? 
I'm supposed to have him till the weekend. 
Shane wanted to come home, 'cause his dad's a loser. 
Did your show get cancelled yet? 
We don't know, Stephanie. 
We're waiting for Tracy to Skype with Liz and Jeremy the lizard. 
You're a joke. David is taking 
us all to Outback Steakhouse, and we're getting appetizers, 'cause David can afford them. 
Well, of course he can. 
Mr. big shot pet photographer. 
I hope he can sleep at night. 
Never thought I'd feel sorry for a guy with a tattoo of a leprechaun vomiting on a book. 
No one's coming to save you. 
 Oh. 
 Because we're deep inside one of Connecticut's 30 beautiful state forests. 
30! 
Oh, please, don't kill me. 
I still haven't tried the famous seafood pizza at Sally's in New Haven. 
And cut. 
Great. All right. 
Let's move on to the scene where Slaughterface centipedes Jenna to the docent of the Danbury Railway Museum. 
Hold on. 
I just spoke to Walmart. 
They sponsor wholesome TV programming, and I've convinced them to get into the movie business. 
They will partially fund this project if we make it family-friendly. 
I can never find stuff to watch with my kids. 
Thank you, Walmart. 
This production will be profitable. 
Jenna, to your dressing room to write. 
It begins with the words. 
Reggie. 
I need to show you something. 
Whoa. 
Is that your deltoid? 
I'm gonna beat you, Reggie. 
But I don't want to. 
I saw you in the lobby with Stephanie and Shane talking about David and appetizers. 
Look, I know what it's like for your kids to think you're a loser. 
Which is why I'm gonna throw the match. 
Wow. 
You would do that for me? 
Know what your wife told me in the shower this morning? 
You're a good guy. 
Oh, miss Lemon, wake up. 
It's him. 
Okay, this is it, Parcell. 
We got to keep Tracy on the line, so draw him out. 
Don't spook him. 
Act normal. 
Hello. 
I'm a baby. 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't know. 
 You got in my head. 
 Hang on. 
Something's not right. 
Why is Jeremy acting so weird? 
I don't like this. 
 Hey, Tracy, don't hang up. 
 Uhoh. 
Jeremy, call me when you're alone. 
I'm sorry, miss Lemon. 
Don't be. 
I know where he is. 
Merry Christmas! 
I practice abstinence. 
Connecticut! 
And cut. 
We're not done yet. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Phil Rosenthal, the creator of the acclaimed show Everybody Loves Raymond. 
Last great sitcom. 
Still does a 3.4 share 
in Syndication. 
I did okay. 
I have a refrigerator that's just for sodas. 
Anyway, Phil is interested in getting into acting. 
 I got the bug. 
 And has offered to pay us $5 million to be in the movie. 
I'll rewrite the part myself. 
You know what, why don't we just get one as written, and then we'll play with it. 
You are a guest here, Phil. 
Hello, Phil. 
I never heard back about my audition for Everybody Loves Raymond. 
I'd wondered if you made a decision. 
Yeah, 15 years ago. 
We went with Doris Roberts. 
But thank you for tying your headshot around a brick and throwing it through my window. 
Go ahead, bald bitch. 
Go ahead. 
Thanks for doing this. 
I convinced my ex to drop off my kid so he could see me being a winner. 
You rock. 
No one's gonna know that you did this or that you're actually stronger than me. 
It doesn't matter. 
All that matters is I'm doing the right thing. 
That's real strength. 
Ha. 
I beat you. 
We're getting lunch from Ikea. 
 Ikea! 
 Ikea! Ikea! 
Ikea! Ikea! 
That's fine. 
Don't offer your guest anything. 
Wax statue. 
Darn it. 
I thought we had him. 
Are you kidding me? 
You have been hiding in my apartment for the last two weeks? 
What are you mad about? 
I'm waiving the $60,000 you owe me in appearance fees. 
Did you really think I wouldn't recognize my college futon with its trademark absence of sex stains? 
This is the stupidest idea you've ever had. 
Really? 
Think about it. 
TGS is your whole life. 
So where's the last place you would be if you were out trying to save your show? 
Home. Life lesson 
from an unlikely source. 
The only thing I do here is sleep. 
I know. 
I seen you do it. 
You're having a dream. 
Is this your only mustard? 
Huh? What? 
Yeah. 
You're the one who wrote "every kind of mustard" on my shopping list. 
And yet you still don't have the one I'm thinking of. 
It's red. 
It says ketchup on it. 
Oh, I hear it. 
That's on me. 
Look, Tracy. 
I don't know why you're going crazy, but I want to help. 
Just come back to TGS. 
You don't think I want to, L.L.? 
Then why are you hiding? 
Oh, no, did you also spill ice cream on your mom's boyfriend's record player? 
As a time saver, I will refer to the two of you as Klemon. 
I wanted that next level, Klemon. 
Now, remember, to save time, you two are Klemon. 
 It's a combination of... 
 Just keep going. 
I had everything I dreamed of. 
Awards, respect, Justin Long's autograph. 
But I also got expectations. 
People thought I could change the world. 
And it's too much pressure. 
Like the time I got stuck in Temple Grandin's hugging machine at the Golden Globes party. 
You pretended to be in Africa so that no one would be disappointed in you. 
I'm sorry I did this to you, half of Klemon. 
I had no choice. 
Sean Penn wanted me to go to Haiti with him. 
And I'm not strong enough for the pain and the human misery of a three-hour plane ride with Sean Penn. 
I'm tired of hiding. 
I just want my old life back. 
Then you need to get people to stop respecting you and start remembering what an idiot you are. 
You're off the leash, Tracy. 
It's not a leash. 
It's a very long skin tag. 
You want your old life back? 
You're Tracy Jordan. 
Hulk Hogan called you a dirt bag. 
The NAACP once hired someone to kill you. 
You wore a penis hat to princess Diana's funeral. 
Because I had worn it to their wedding. 
It was special to the three of us. 
You were the worst, and you can be again. 
You just have to go out there and remind people who you really are. 
Go trash a hotel room, expose yourself to Elmo, visit OJ in jail again, attack the Lincoln Memorial with a hammer. 
I have to burn all my goodwill. 
Then they won't expect anything from me. 
And you can go back to your old life and TGS. 
Tracy Jordan is off the leash! 
Godspeed, Mr. Jordan. 
 I'm the hero cop   and I'm here to say   don't do drugs   is what I'm here to say  I can't believe that amazing rap is available now on iTunes. 
Are you kidding? 
No one's gonna pay to see that. 
It doesn't matter, It's already profitable. It works, Lemon. 
To vote for Phil Rosenthal text "Phil" to 62288, Vote? For what? Isn't this 
supposed to be a movie? 
Again, it doesn´t matter. People will 
just to anything to get 99 cents of text. 
Well, I'm not letting Rosenthal win I am voting for the muppet. 
To vote for Liz Lemon text "Liz" to 62288. 
﻿1  How's it going in there? 
 Great. 
Trying on jeans is my favorite thing. 
Maybe later I can get a paps mirror from an old male doctor. 
Oh, come on, Liz. 
This store is cool. 
It's huge with all the young people. 
I mean... all the us. 
This place is trying way too hard. 
Why are there straightjackets everywhere? 
Because before this was a clothing store, it was a mental hospital. 
It's winky and fun, Liz. 
Okay, I tried them on. 
Can we go now? 
Liz Lemon, you look hot. 
Really? 
I swear to Kaballah monster. 
Those jeans are perfect. 
Look at your butt. 
Oh, my God. 
Is that me? 
Liz, it's the dream. 
Boy on the bottom, girl on the top. 
O.M. God, 
those jeans are zing! 
This online slang dictionary says it's short for "amazing." 
Or it's a club drug made from a tooth whitener. 
Either way you win. 
I'll wear these jeans out, and I'll take ten more pairs! 
'Tastic. Shall I put the pants 
you had on in with the jeans? 
No. Burn them. 
Burn them! 
I'm sorry I was late this morning, sir. 
 I was attacked in my apartment... 
 Quiet. 
Congressional candidate Regina Bookman... 
Are they really talking about that woman? 
...Making political hay 
out of the wheat field that is the NBC-Kabletown merger... 
Who wrote this? 
Jared, honestly? 
Bookman told reporters, quote, "The merger of NBC and Kabletown is bad for the consumer. 
"I don't trust their executive leadership, "and Kabletown still has an auxiliary button "on their remote. 
"What is that for? 
It just makes the screen go blue." 
Why is she still talking about the merger? 
She said I had three months to make NBC more diverse. 
It's not your fault nobody watched America's next top black guy. 
Bookman, amping up the rhetoric in a tight race. 
Polls have her in a dead heat with out-of-nowhere challenger Steven Austin. 
Wait a second. 
There's a chance she could lose? 
Bookman is obviously holding a gun to my head. 
And no matter what I do, she obviously wants me to fail. 
But if she loses... 
This isn't a conversation! 
But if she loses, I won't have to worry about her scuttling the merger. 
Jonathan, get her opponent in here. 
Whoever he is, he just made a very powerful friend. 
I thought you said you didn't need any more friends. 
'Zing leg-tubes, Liz. 
Vunderhinder! 
They're from Brooklyn Without Limits. 
It's this very cool store with locations in Gay Town, White Harlem, and the Van Beardswick section of Brooklyn. 
And they don't just look great. 
See the tag? 
"Handmade in U.S.A." 
Because BWL is all about fair trade and local artisans and staying green. 
These jeans totally make up for all the times I took a long, hot shower because I was bored. 
I'm so excited for you, Liz. 
Now we both have amazing butts. 
Make that all three of us. 
Jenna, a word. 
Specifically, the word "talking." 
Oh, and look at this. 
J-train, as you may know, I was in a film called Hard to Watch. 
And the pundits think I have a chance at an Oscar, and I just learned about air quotes. 
Yes. I talked about 
your movie with my therapist last week for 20 hours. 
I know this is difficult for you. 
I'm fine. 
Talking with Dr. Linda 
helped me realize I have just as much going on in my life. 
My exercise video is dropping soon. 
It's called Jenna Gets Hard. 
Well, if you're okay talking about it, I need your help. 
These reporters want to come do a story on me. 
They're from something called the Hollywood foreign press association. 
HOFPA? 
 Yeah. 
 That's the Golden Globes. 
The second-most-important awards in Hollywood... 
After the People's Choice Awards... 
Where the fans are in charge. 
So what do you think I should do? 
You could have a special screening for them... 
host a luncheon. 
And when the time is right... 
Be bad at snapping. Got it. 
No, Tracy. 
You could try to bribe them. 
I mean, a Golden Globe is a stepping stone to an Oscar. 
How bad do you want it? 
I'm not an expert at morality, but isn't that wrong? 
You're asking me? 
So this is the man who's gonna bring down Regina Bookman. 
Rhode Island's own Steven Austin! 
Actually, I go by Steve Austin. 
That way people see my name on ballots, they think I'm the wrestler, and they vote for me. 
I've been reading up on you, Steve. 
Honestly, I want to like you. 
But I see that you're not affiliated with the republican party. 
The party system is broken, Jack. 
I don't believe in parties. 
I don't join 'em, and I never get invited to 'em...Hint, hint. 
You're an individual. 
A Maverick. 
People like you are succeeding because Americans are fed up with the status quo. 
Exactly. 
They're tired of the direction this country's headed in. 
They want to return to our past glory. 
They want an American renaissance! 
I like what I'm hearing, Steve. 
Then you're gonna love the sound of this. 
Goo goo gaa gaa, Jack. 
What's that? 
That's the theme of my campaign. 
Renaissance means rebirth. 
I want to usher in the rebirth of this country. 
That's why the theme of all my campaign commercials is "I'm a baby." 
This country has lost its way. 
We need to start over and return to what made our nation great. 
My name is Steve Austin, and I'm a lifelong resident of Rhode Island, and the manager of a local paintball facility. 
I will clean out Washington, like it's the bathroom of a paintball facility. 
Vote Steve Austin. 
And if you're blind, I am the wrestler. 
Right. 
I like a lot of what you're saying, Steve, but before I throw my support behind you, I do have a litmus test. 
Okay. Can I take that 
in two weeks? 
No, it's just questions. 
What do you think the role of the government should be? 
Limited. I believe 
in small government. 
 Excellent answer. 
 Or no government at all. 
If it works in Antarctica, why can't it work here? 
But if we have to have government, make it as small as possible. 
Dwarves, tiny buildings... 
Pizza bagels for lunch. 
Maybe we should stop at small government. 
Let's cut to the chase. 
I need you to assure me you would never allow the government to interfere with the sale of one company to another. 
Of course not. The government 
shouldn't interfere in anything! 
What happens inside a man's own rain poncho at a minor league baseball game is his own business. 
Well, Steve, we should stop talking before I change my mind. 
But I do want to host a fundraiser for you, so give me a couple of days to put that together. 
I need to know that you believe in my message, Jack. 
Take the rattle. 
Say "goo goo gaa gaa," Jack. 
Goo goo gaa gaa. 
What's going on here? 
I'm helping Tracy plan for a Golden Globes event tomorrow. 
Kenneth is our human Sushi platter, and I'm doing a dry run so everything will be perfect... 
For my friend Tracy. 
Lying perfectly still reminds me of hiding under our porch during a hill people rampage. 
On the day, Kenneth's mouth will be filled with wasabi so he don't do so much... 
I should get a chafing dish and fill it with my underwear in case some Saudi guys show up. 
Let me get this straight. 
You, the person who is still jealous of the attention baby Jessica got, are helping Tracy win an award for acting? 
Oh, I'm helping him, all right. 
I even gave him the idea to try to bribe them. 
And he's gonna do that? 
That's awful. 
I trust award shows. 
They tell me how much to care about different dead people. 
It's not gonna work. 
If they could be bribed, I would have won a golden globe for my lifetime original movie sister, can you spare a breast? 
So you've tried this before? 
And they were so offended, they banned me for life. 
And the same thing will happen to Tracy. 
So you're sabotaging him. 
Just like I did to my niece when she tried to sing at our family's Christmas party. 
You know what, you and Tracy deserve each other. 
I don't know which of you to be more disappointed in. 
Me, silly. 
I'm more aware of what I'm doing. 
I'm sorry, miss. 
Do you know where Liz Lemon... Good God! 
Lemon, those jeans make you look like a Mexican sports reporter. 
Thank you, Jack. Hi. 
Do I know you from outside the bagel store? 
You probably know me from the future, where I am the president of the United States. 
Steve Austin, Rhode Island's independent candidate for congress. 
Oh, yeah, somebody forwarded me one of your campaign ads. 
The rebirth of America starts now. 
Waaaaah! 
My name is Steve Austin, and if you're senile, yes, I am the six-million dollar man! 
Paid for by the broken vending machine at the paintball place. 
I'm actually working with Steve's campaign, and I would like you to produce a biographical video for a fundraiser I'm hosting. 
Oh, my God! 
I got a zappos box coming today, and there's nobody there to pick it up because my wife left me for my twin brother. 
Can I use your phone? 
Yeah, okay. 
You don't have a cell phone? 
Yeah, I got a cell phone. 
I walk around all day with a CIA tracking device in my pocket. 
Okay, that guys is bananas. 
Obviously he should not be in congress... What are you doing? 
He's running against Regina Bookman... I need him. 
Aha. So you're putting 
one more nut job... 
Yeah, I said it... "one more." 
I'm political in Washington so you can advance your career? 
What is going on today? 
Has everyone lost their moral compass? 
You're being awfully high and mighty for someone who once claimed her husband drowned so she could get out of a gym contract. 
The whole Kabletown deal is resting on this, and Austin is pro-business. 
Big business is what's screwing up this country. 
Please, Lemon, you work for General Electric! 
Technically, I am a freelancer, which is pretty much a modern-day cowboy. 
And I live like a cowboy by buying quality, locally made jeans. 
Also by eating beans out of a can due to impatience. 
You're on your own here, partner. 
But hey, it's not all bad, 'cause you get to watch me walk away. 
No, no, that's not right. 
Why can't the delivery guy just leave it out back? 
Yeah, I know it's not a house, but I sleep there. 
I'd like to thank you all for coming. 
We've heard complaints about the Sushi platter moving... 
We're working on it. 
I'm sorry. 
Tracy would be happy to take any softball questions you have, like the following... 
What films inspire you? 
Well, definitely the foreign films. 
Like the political ones where you think there'll be no boobies, then bam! Boobies. 
Tracy, what is an actor? 
I think the better question is, what isn't an actor? 
A lamp. A couch. 
That mirror. 
Or a hidden pistol. 
An actor... 
And now, amidst a day of wonders, one wonder more. 
A special voters-only screening of Hard to Watch, based on the book Stone Cold Bummer, by manipulate. 
They call New York the Big Apple. 
Never seemed that way to me. 
I used to have dreams. 
I was an all-city running back, and I was gonna run out of here to college, the suburbs. 
Now the only thing I use a football for is as a toilet. 
Funny thing to happen to a guy named "lucky." 
  I am a constitutional originalist, and I believe that our founding fathers had it right. 
We need to get back to their America. 
No paved roads. 
Rum used as an anesthetic. 
Legalized slavery. 
All right. 
Some good pieces. 
Jack, you want to see my hand gestures? 
I have you listen to me! 
Forceful conclusion. 
There's work to be done. 
Hand me that shovel so I can dig a grave for her. 
Okay, let's cut. 
Sir, look at this Bookman photo op. 
"Representative Bookman greets young voters at Warwick mall." 
She's courting the youth vote. 
That means she's desperate. 
My generation never votes. 
It interferes with talking about ourselves all the time. 
She's running scared. 
God, this could work. 
Now all I have to do is whip Austin into shape. 
Hey, Jack, just to have options, should we do a couple takes with Binky? 
 Let's take five. 
 Wow. 
You're really going ahead with this. 
Lemon, I'm not about to take criticism from someone wearing that tee shirt. 
Hey, don't talk down Brooklyn Without Limits. 
Stores like this are saving the world. 
Really? You're gonna lecture 
me about big business again? 
Do you know who owns Brooklyn without limits? 
Brooklyn Zack. 
He throws pool parties in dumpsters. 
Halliburton. 
In the mid-'90s, they found themselves with a surplus of canvas waterboarding hoods, so they had sweatshops make them into messenger bags to sell to outer-borough idiots. 
You don't know what you're talking about. 
Handmade in USA. 
Your magic jeans are from BWL? 
Oh, Lemon, it's not handmade in USA. 
It's pronounced hond-made in oosa. 
The hond people are a vietnamese slave tribe, and USA is their island prison. 
They made your jeans. 
You know how they get the stitching so small? 
Orphans. 
No! 
Brooklyn Zack is real. 
He just got back from Peru, where he met a family that's been making hats for 2,000 years. 
We all make our compromises. 
At least I'm doing it for our company, for jobs. 
You're doing it for your ass! 
I don't believe you. 
The liberal media would have told me about this. 
There's no such thing. 
The New York times is owned by  NYT incorporated, which is owned by Altheon Ballistic Dynamics, which is owned by the Murdoch family, who are owned... 
By Halliburton. 
It goes all the way to the top. 
How can you work here? 
Do you know who owns this place? 
Halliburton, bitch. 
So what? 
But look at you! 
You're meticulously groomed, and... 
and you turned a tie into a belt. 
Oh, so gay men can't be conservative? 
You're so 'norant. 
That's short for ignorant. 
That's short for "ignorant." 
And who are you to judge? 
You're still wearing those jeans. 
Ah...Che Guevara... 
If only you knew what this place stood for. 
His great grandfather was Domingo Halliburton. 
Wow! 
I haven't seen so many suits since my trial. 
I have an idea. I know these 
people, so let me do the talking. 
Oh, uh, Steve? 
Of course you know Ed Perlman. 
Perlman, isn't that last name Jew... 
New strategy. 
I'll raise the money, and you stay in here and cultivate an aura of mystery. 
Ooh, good idea. 
Maybe I'll add to it by making some mysterious sounds. 
 Oooooohhh... Yeeeeeeee... 
 I love it. 
I'll go to jail in Deshawn's place 'cause he's my brother. 
Don't say nothin'. 
Sometimes you gotta do the right thing... 
Even when the wrong thing is a whole lot easier. 
Now let's just have one last happy dinner together... 
As a family! 
Your mother exploded. 
I got them right where I want them. 
Time to do a little Golden Globe shopping. 
No, Tracy... That movie gave 
me drunk-in-the-bathtub face. 
We need to talk. 
Thank you for coming. 
Well, you were right about Brooklyn Without Limits. 
Crunchy on the outside, right-wing nut job on the inside. 
Like Anne Coulter's underwear. 
But I see you're still wearing the jeans. 
I know! 
They look so good. 
And I'm skyping later with Carol, and we like to dance together. 
And I want to do this "back it up" move that I haven't been able to pull off since high school. 
It's like... 
 back it up, back it up   and drop it like it's hot   drop it like it's hot   I will haunt your dreams  So fine, I'm selling out. 
But so are you. 
No. I believe 
in Steve Austin and his plan to put a casino on the moon. 
Then I believe in Halliburton. 
Good. So neither of us 
should feel guilty. 
We don't. 
Sabotage? But I'm the one 
who does that to me. 
I know, Tracy. 
It was wrong. 
But I couldn't go through with it because I saw your movie. 
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but you're great. 
Wait, great like good, or grate like the thing I dropped my asthma inhaler down the other day? 
The first one, Tray. 
You are going to win. 
And when you do, I'll be furious. 
Like waking up next to Rob Schneider furious. 
But I don't care. 
It's like you said in the movie... 
Sometimes you gotta do the right thing, even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier. 
No, don't say that. 
In real life, you have to make compromises. 
No, Liz Lemon, it's like the thing I said in another movie I made. 
Compromises are for lesser souls. 
Die, werewolf zombie! 
So you two have decided to do the right thing? 
Ugh! Fine! 
I'll go home and change! 
Take a last look, guys. 
 I would hit that. 
 Too small. 
I believe we are all being held in slavery by big government. 
Lesbian Mario brothers. 
I couldn't do it, Jack. 
I just couldn't support BWL. 
And I'd already thrown out all my other jeans. 
That is the most unflattering item of clothing I have ever seen you wear. 
And I'm including 2008's turtleneck with smiley-face vest. 
But I feel good. 
And not just because in my shorteralls I found a bag of tastetations, a discontinued chocolate hard candy, but because sometimes you gotta do the right thing, even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier. 
Die, werewolf zombie. 
Good God, Lemon! 
I will never allow casinos on the moon! 
Thank you! 
 Steve? 
 Friend or foe? 
You're the reason everyone came here tonight. 
They need to hear you speak. 
In person. 
From the heart. 
Damn you, shorteralls! 
Americans are a simple but powerful people, which is why I have written a new national anthem. 
 Ooga booga big   ooga booga strong   I am going to sing my ooga booga song   ooga booga big   ooga booga strong  Wow! That's worse than 
the speech my grandpa made when my cousin married a Japanese girl. 
As if that weren't enough, Austin was mocked in Jay Leno's monologue tonight. 
The kingmaker has spoken. 
It's over. 
Bookman will be reelected. 
But you did the right thing. 
And at the end of the day, isn't that more important than some merger? 
Letting morality get in the way of making money... 
I might as well go and be a teacher. 
I know what will cheer you up. 
Would you like some cake? 
Yeah. 
Cake boy! 
This has been the best day of my life. 
I believe ketchup bottles should be 500% larger. 
We are all responsible for heroes becoming terrible. 
But what kind of jail are these alien prisoners being held in? 
We should bring back slavery! 
And they're backed by big corporations. 
Animals can govern themselves. 
Taken out of context. 
It was exactly what I meant. 
As God is my witness, we will build casinos on the moon!

1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,812
From the top, one more time, guys.

2
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:06,919
Everyone, I need your attention.
Gather up.

3
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,516
I said everyone, Sketch-Tron 6000.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,189
Mr. Hank Hooper,

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,155
the owner of our new
parent company, Kabletown,

6
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,635
is touring 30 Rock
for the first time today.

7
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,937
I <i>will</i> make
a good first impression,

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,130
so I need all of you
to be your most normal.

9
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:27,132
Tracy, do not mention where
you think dinosaurs come from.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,567
Do not mention
the underwater city

11
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,002
of Sauronicon...
Got it.

12
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,470
Jenna, get all of your
crazy yelling

13
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:32,554
out of your system.

14
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:33,772
If you don't volumize my hair,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,340
I will choke you to death

16
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:37,642
- with your boyfriend's wig!
- Very good.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,544
Frank, how is
your armpit thing?

18
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,813
Not great. It's almost
touching my thigh thing.

19
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,585
Okay, let's do our best.

20
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:50,222
Remember, everyone,
just don't be yourselves.

21
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,041
Lemon, meet me
in my office in ten.

22
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:54,326
I need to ask you something.

23
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,661
Oh, do you need sex advice?
Here's a tip.

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,097
Sometimes a lady likes
to leave her blazer on.

25
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:04,720
Sir, ma'am,
this is for you... a gift bag.

26
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,072
"To my two favorite
sketch stars.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,558
Your new friend,
Hank Hooper."

28
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,477
That's nice.
Actors deserve gifts.

29
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,980
Without us, who would
present awards to actors?

30
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,520
So...Which one of us is
going to get this computer?

31
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,055
Just kidding.
We both are!

32
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,690
Wow, I always wanted
one of these.

33
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,359
The box would make
a perfect coffin

34
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:28,410
for my Teddy Bear.

35
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:31,229
There's two of everything!

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,800
Look at us.
When we met four years ago,

37
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,868
we were fighting about
the silliest things...

38
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,703
Dressing rooms, air time,

39
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,539
you coming in
and ruining my show...

40
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,374
You taking
my nephew's virginity.

41
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,744
I feel we've finally found
a balance in our relationship.

42
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,952
There's only one.

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,155
You take it.
I don't care.

44
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:59,925
I want you to selfishly take
the best sweatshirt

45
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,494
in the world.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,898
Lemon, this is
a little delicate,

47
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:10,001
but I wonder if you
might take Avery shopping

48
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,203
for baby things.

49
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,438
- Oh, sure.
- You know, a crib,

50
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,407
small clothes, a tiny desk

51
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,542
with a miniature pen set on it.

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,077
I don't know a lot
about babies,

53
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:20,579
but I know that
Avery would enjoy

54
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,914
having another woman
go with her.

55
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,249
Of course.
I'm just a little surprised.

56
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,918
I assumed Avery would have
a terrifying best friend

57
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,553
she'd do stuff like that with.

58
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,921
Avery does have a sister,

59
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,324
but Eugenia is currently
institutionalized for nerves...

60
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:33,458
[whispers] Lesbian...

61
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:34,759
And all of her work friends
are out

62
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,061
because she's still trying

63
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,562
to keep her pregnancy a secret.

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,164
Really?
She's eight months.

65
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,982
How is she possibly hiding it?

66
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,067
Michael Kors is a friend.

67
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,485
We own a gay racehorse
together.

68
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,871
And I convinced him to make
wizard cloaks fashionable

69
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,072
for ladies this winter.

70
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,306
It's my fault for asking.

71
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,775
The problem is that
Avery is very close

72
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,444
to being named
the financial reporter

73
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,612
for <i>NBC Nightly News.</i>

74
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,979
If anyone finds out
she's pregnant,

75
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:56,114
she won't get the job.

76
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,283
Ah, see,
that would never happen

77
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,951
if <i>men</i> could get pregnant.

78
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,986
Which is the premise
of my one-act play

<i>The Seahorses</i>
<i>of Warwickshire Abbey.</i>

80
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,374
Avery just needs to keep
her condition under wraps

81
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,426
until her contract is signed.

82
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,794
Unfortunately,
her competition for the job

83
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:13,164
is Carmen Chao...
From MSNBC.

84
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,867
Oh, I know her.
Hey, what ethnicity is she?

85
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,035
No one knows.

86
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,236
In international news,

87
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:20,105

00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,673
is traveling this week to China

89
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,408
to meet with premier
Wen Jiabao,

90
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,577
and then stopping
for a well-deserved vacation

91
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,011
in Negril, Jamaica, mon.

92
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,281
If Carmen finds out
Avery's pregnant,

93
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:31,550
she'll use it to destroy her.
Carmen's very sneaky.

94
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,518
And that's not racist because
I don't know what she is.

95
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,520
Man, we all lead
such complicated lives.

96
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,655
Hey, do you want to go

97
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:37,855
to that new popcorn place
for lunch?

98
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,374
I'm going
to the executive dining room

99
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,659
to meet with Hank Hooper.

100
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,544
I can't wait to shake his hand.

101
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,130
You can tell a lot about someone
by their handshake.

102
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,766
You are confident.

103
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,336
And you ate dinner
in front of a mirror last night.

104

I'm a hugger.

110
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,784
No. Doesn't count
as a hug

111
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,654
unless it goes on
for ten seconds.

112
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,988
Yeah.

Well, it is an honor, sir,

I'm no "sir," Jack.
Call me Hank.

Sure.

Let me ask you a question.

139
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:26,181
Do you know who came up
with the idea for the DVR?

140

It was the guy who
drives me home every night.

141
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,651
The original name for the DVR

142
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,587
was "The Thing
Carlos Thought Of."

143

Since then, I make sure
that once a month,

No. You can't take this

Was I supposed to throw up
in something of mine?

You gave this to me.

- Are you pregnant?
- Isn't that wonderful news?

225

for Avery last night.

So what, now people think
I'm pregnant?

I am telling everyone here

that there's no way
I could be pregnant

Well, <i>employee</i> pitch day was,

321
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:44,722
of course,
a new experience for me.

322
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,390
Oh, speaking of
new experiences,

323
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,892
I ate at an Indian restaurant
last night.

324
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
I had naan.

325
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,646
Sir... I mean, Hank,

326
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,064
I appreciate that you have
your way of doing things,

327
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,265
but so do I.

328
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,002
I am a six sigma
black belt ultra,

329
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,770
with the groin branding
to prove it.

330
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,405
What's six sigma?
Rock band?

331
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:02,606
I'd like to start this meeting

332
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:05,275
by sharing one of my own ideas.

333
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,144
And after you hear it,
maybe we can agree

334
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,613
that employee pitch day
is time that could be

335
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:12,282
better spent drinking and
looking out the window.

336
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,584
Okay, Jack!

337
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,502
You're putting it on the line.

338
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,021
What have you got?

339
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,223
Hank, what's the one part
of the television experience

340
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,424
that's not perfect?

341
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,593
To me, it's the remote control.

342
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,694
Too easy to lose, right?

343
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,363
Yes! I lose my remote
all the time.

344
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:29,133
Grr, couch cushions!
[Chuckles]

345
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,834
What if you didn't need
a remote control

346
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:33,670
because your remote control
was your own voice?

347
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,775
Television on.
Channel, NBC.

348
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,177
A crew out of the Bronx
called the Ace of Deuces.

349
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:41,512
Amazing.

350
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,448
I give you voice activation.

351
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,950
Word from my C.I.
is he got offed by...

352
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,886
That shouldn't happen.
TV on!

353
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:52,022
Voice activation,
or "vo-act..."

354
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,324
The only wit we have
is some mute kid...

355
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,894
- Un-mute!
- My friends at the D.E.A. say

356
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,630
these guys have
a high volume of cocaine...

357
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,165
Low volume.
Low volume!

358
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:03,250
First I want to go home
and delete everything

359
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,369
- that's on my DVR.
- Oh, come on!

360
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,037
TV mute!

361
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,040
Jack, it doesn't seem to work.

362
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,475
You got any other notions,

363
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,210
or should we jump
to employee ideas?

364
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,913
No, no. No.
I have another idea.

365
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,417
What if, uh...
What if...

366
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,287
You had a black bar
at the bottom of the screen

367
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,355
that prevented you from
seeing anything dirty?

368
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,191
I like that.

369
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,525
I like that a lot.

370
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:30,994
It would allow parents
to eliminate racy content,

371
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,396
like soccer, or a woman
stuffing a turkey.

372
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:36,166
That's a real family company
kind of idea, Jack.

373
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,419
And we could sell ads
in the black bar...

374
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,770
Increase our revenue streams!

375
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,738
You could call it
"Blabar."

376
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,674
A-plus work, Jack!

377
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,442
I don't need to hear
anything else.

378
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,945
If that's the kind of ideas
you're bringing... nine, ten...

379
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:53,016
You will go far, son.
Yeah!

380
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,421
Crap.

381
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:01,024
Kenneth, we need to talk.

382
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:03,460
Earlier today,
I told Hank Hooper

383
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:07,097
about your black bar concept,
and he loved it.

384
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,900
However, I presented it
as my own idea.

385
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,902
Wonderful! Next topic.

386
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,804
What? Uh, no.

387
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,906
This is an opportunity for you.

388
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,575
You have me over a barrel.
What are you going to do?

389
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,110
Not what my uncle does

390
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,045
when he gets a hitchhiker over
a barrel, I'll tell you that.

391
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:23,914
This is business, Kenneth.

392
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,949
All bosses steal
from their employees.

393
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,752
But in return,
the employee gets something.

394
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,188
You didn't steal anything
from me, sir.

395
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:32,289
Last time I checked,

396
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,058
best friends can't steal
from each other.

397
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,828
Now, stop being a silly Simon.

398
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,763
[Chuckles]

399
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,666
This isn't how it works!

400
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,602
You're the one being
a silly Simon!

401
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,840
Carmen, what are you
doing here?

402
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,825
Well, you didn't call back
to schedule our interview,

403
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,026
so I thought I'd just
ambush you

404
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,278
with some pregnancy questions.

405
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,829
I hope you're not unprepared.

406
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,282
Of course not.

407
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,851
- When are you due?
- April 20th, Hitler's birthday.

408
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,186
What's your pediatrician's
name?

409
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,288
Dr. Rufus T. Barleysheath.

410
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,006
- Where was the baby conceived?
- In my vagina.

411
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,257
What names are you considering?

412
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,126
- Rufus T. Barleysheath.
- How are you feeling?

413
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:10,460
Oh, a little achy and nauseous,

414
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:11,562
- but I'm hanging in there.
- Are you pregnant?

415
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,632
No...way that I'm not.

416
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Owen, screw.

417
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:20,971
I don't know why
you're doing this for Jessup.

418
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,673
She's a blonde. Don't you know
there's a war going on?

419
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,275
Or are you doing it
for her old man husband?

420
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,443
He's your boss.

421
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,779
First of all,
Jack means nothing to me.

422
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,547
Shoot him in the throat
and let the dogs eat him.

423
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,532
I don't care.

424
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,749
What's wrong with you?

425
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,051
Almost everything.

426
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:35,185
But let's get back
to the interview.

427
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,753
We're done with that portion.

428
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,488
I thought it would be
a fun visual

429
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,191
if we got some b-roll of you
taking sexy pregnancy photos

430
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:42,492
where you bare your stomach

431
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,661
like the pregnant bitch
that you are.

432
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:45,896
What do you say?

433
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,801
Let's take some pictures.

434
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,787
Innovation that is both family
and bottom line friendly.

435
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:02,958
Gentlemen, I give you Blabar.

436
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,894
You're really sexing me
right now.

437
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:06,862
It's filthy.

438
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,498
[Laughter, applause]

439
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,866
Jack! Jack!

00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,103
All: Jack! Jack! Jack...

[Whistles]

442
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,507
[Elevator bell dings]

443
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,753
One time, I saw a turtle...

444
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,023
Who the hell
do you think you are?

445
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,059
This is not the way
the world works, Kenneth.

446
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,427
Bosses steal,

447
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,396
and employees use it
for leverage.

448
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,765
So what do you want?
Money? A promotion?

449
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:43,933
I can get you into a restaurant

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,668
where you watch a child
play with a bunny,

451
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:46,735
then you eat the bunny.

452
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,070
Isn't that just Easter?

453
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,572
And I don't want anything, sir.

454
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,574
I'm just happy
to spend all day here

455
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:53,776
helping my work family.

456
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:56,245

I now work for a man

457
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,646
who thinks like you.

458
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:59,915
Does he also solve mazes
by starting from the end?

459
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,384
I need this, Kenneth.
I used you, now leverage it.

No, sir.

I am ordering you to strike me.

464
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,193
There will be no retaliation,

465
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,561
but if you refuse,
you're fired.

No.
I don't even know how.

00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,506
I was just about
to hop on my bus

481
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:58,640
back to Philadelphia.

482
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,908
I don't fly,
but I got my own bus

483
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,143
with a pool table in it.

484
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,612
We'll drive to Branson
together sometime,

485
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,347
take in a Yakov Smirnoff show.

486
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,416
Doesn't Russia sound
like a crazy place?

487
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,717
Yes, sir.

488
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:11,420
But before you go,
I want you to meet someone.

489
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:14,323
This is Kenneth Parcell,
one of our pages.

490
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,474
Oh, I didn't notice
you there, son.

491
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,259
You do not have
a lot of charisma.

492
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,061
Kenneth is the one
who came up with

493
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,530
the Blabar idea, not me.

494
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:24,266
- I'm sorry I misled you.
- Oh.

495
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,469
Well, Jack, I have to say
I'm surprised.

496
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,571
Here is my letter
of resignation.

497
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,440
It's probably for the best

498
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,475
since this is obviously
not a good fit.

499
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,477
If you call security
to escort me out,

500
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,346
you should know
I have several pistols

501
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,480
hidden on me.

502
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:41,150
Hold on, Jack.
No one's quitting.

503
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,885
I'm impressed you told me that.

504
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:46,055
You have a reputation,
Jack, as a shark.

505
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,158
Kabletown, we're not sharks.
We're more like...

506
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,560
Whatever
the friendliest fish is.

507
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:53,962
I'm not a science guy.
The point is,

508
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,864
I wasn't sure
how you were gonna fit in,

509
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,100
but you doing something
like this

510
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,168
tells me we're gonna be
just fine.

511
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,522
Very well. Good.

512
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,007
And Jack should
give you something

513
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,576
- for that idea, son.
- Finally. Thank you.

514
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,863
- Quid pro quo.
- But I don't want anything.

515
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,347
No?
How about a hug?

516
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,684
You've gotta be kidding me.

517
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,355
- Heh...
- Sir...

518
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:21,557
It doesn't count as a hug

519
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,358
unless it goes on
for ten seconds.

520
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,660
You got that right, son.

521
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:30,032
One...Mississippi...

522
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,201
That's some good hugging.

523
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,436
And as excited as I am
to be joining the team

524
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:35,771
on Nightly News,

525
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,340
I will miss my dear friends
here on basic cable.

526
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,210
But, Carmen, you have an
exciting new assignment, right?

527
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:43,712
Yes. I will be
covering hurricanes...

528
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,682
Thank you, Lemon.
I owe you.

529
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,434
If you want
to make it up to me,

530
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:50,352
I have my eye
on a toilet pillow

531
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,387
from a certain
medical supply store.

532
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,856
Avery and I want
the baby's middle name

533
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:56,225
to be Elizabeth, after you.

534
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:59,361
Oh, Jack, that's so gayballs.

535
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,579
[Knock on door]

536
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:03,949
Hey, Liz.
Can we get you anything?

537
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,568
Do you need some liniment
rubbed on your perineum?

538
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,937
No, guys,
I'm not really pregnant.

539
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,456
I was just pretending
to help Jack.

540
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,774
Why would you pretend
to help Jack?

541
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:13,775
Help him for real.

542
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,377
It takes the same amount
of time.

543
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:18,780
No, Tracy, she lied to us.

544
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,081
And she ordered us around

545
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,617
like we were
a couple of <i>normals.</i>

546
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:24,920
You will be punished.
Can I have my nunchucks back?

547
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:27,422
Or we could call it even.

548
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,759
Good God!

549
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,862
I have been punished.
These are yours to keep.

550
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,802
What?
Who's the black guy?

551
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,771
A bicycle messenger.

552
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,274

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

553
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,435
You took your pants off.

554
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,762
What if there was a channel that's just
the sound of people having a party

555
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,730
 so you put it on
when you call your parents?

556
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,790
You know what my TV is?

557
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,861
A sunset.

558
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,360
How about a button you push
on your remote

559
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,861
and you can buy
anything you see on TV?

560
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:06,185
Like if you're watching Sex and the City and
you just have to have Mr. Big's spaghetti?

561
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:09,356
What if we executed someone live on TV?

562
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,037
And then I pull off my mask

563
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:15,771
and I'm a lizard person too.

564
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,501
Blackout. End of episode.

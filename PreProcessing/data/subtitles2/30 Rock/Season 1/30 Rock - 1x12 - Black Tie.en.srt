2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,129
Okay, Round 2.
Josh, you're up.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,172
What do you got?

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:05,923
Check it out.

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,299
Your mama is so stupid,

6
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:11,220
she thinks an iMac is
a new hamburger at McDonald's.

7
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,221
Okay, not bad.

8
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,931
Okay, okay, I got one. I got one.

9
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,935
What's the difference between
your mama and a washing machine?

10
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:21,770
When I drop a load in the washing machine
it doesn't follow me around for a week.

11
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,690
Lemon, could I speak
with you alone for a moment?

12
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:28,365
That's what your sister
asked me last night. Booyah!

13
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:31,284
Uh, right this way.

14
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,282
Uh, my friend Gerhard Hapsburg
is throwing a birthday party for himself

15
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:36,490
at the Pierre tonight.

16
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,033
Oh, and you want me to think of something funny
that you can write in the card?

17
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,083
No. I want you to come with me.

18
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:42,370
Oh.

19
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:44,711
Who's Gerhard Hapsburg?

20
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:49,672
Prince Gerhard is the last male descendant
of the Imperial House of Hapsburg.

21
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,053
They ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

22
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,842
The Defenestration of Prague?

23
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,302
Lemon, what exactly did you study in college?

24
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:57,592
- Theatre Tech.
- I see.

25
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:01,270
I'm inviting you
to the social event of the season.

26
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,350
Oh...I don't know, Jack.

27
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,480
Would I have to wear high heel shoes?

28
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,190
Yes. This will be good for you.

29
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:09,063
You finally got Dennis out of your life.

30
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,271
You're even wearing lipstick.

31
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,613
No. They're just really chapped.

32
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:14,280
I'll have the wardrobe department
pull a dress for you.

33
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:20,280
I just thought maybe you'd like
to spend some time with a, um...

34
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,251
different class of people.

35
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,910
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

36
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,292
But I'm not gonna like it.

37
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:28,752
That's what your mom said to me last night.

38
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,343
Booyah.

39
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:32,253
You got slammed, girl.

40
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,631
That was surprising.

41
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,440
Yes, dear.

42
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,650
Oh, boy, who's crying?

43
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:57,493
Is that Caleb?

44
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:58,910
What's up, Pete?

45
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,741
Okay, I'll try. Yeah.

46
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:05,792
Elmo wants you to aim your pee-pee
at the potty!

47
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:10,252
Ha ha! No, not at Mommy.
At the potty.

48
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,751
How is that Elmo's fault?

49
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:16,091
Did Mommy have some wine
before she called Elmo?

50
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,091
Click. Enhhhh!

51
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,930
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.

52
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:23,511
- Where's your spinal cord, son?
- What?

53
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,601
No, it's just my wife is visiting her folks
and she's a little stressed out.

54
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:29,850
Yeah, seem like
you got yourself a Delilah.

55
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,192
A what?

56
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,190
Pete, you got two type of
women in this world:

57
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,653
one who gives you strength

58
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,152
and one who takes strength from you

59
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:41,491
like Delilah took strength
from Samson in that movie?

60
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,491
My wife gives me strength,
make me feel like a man.

61
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,953
That's why she's so special.

62
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,621
I actually haven't met
your wife yet. Hi.

63
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:51,961
That ain't my wife.
Go get me a fizzy water.

64
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,880
It's like this, Pete.
I love my wife. I love her.

65
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,380
We're a team.

66
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:00,300
That's why eight times a week
I go to the strip club.

67
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:03,051
It gives me energy,
which I bring back to her.

68
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,182
And your wife doesn't get jealous?

69
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:06,141
Nah. She likes it.

70
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,521
Makes me feel strong,
like a Samson.

71
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,061
Here.

72
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:12,521
- Samson!
- What?

73
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:16,230
Great shoving, Mr. Jordan.

74
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,861
Wow, what's that for?

75
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:23,702
Well, I'm going to a birthday party
for some prince tonight.

76
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,330
You mean like a dog birthday party?

77
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,622
Oh, that's better.

78
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:30,503
No. He's a real European prince:
Gerhard Hapsburg.

79
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,501
What? You have to take me with you.

80
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:35,131
Oh, Liz, it's always been my dream
to meet and marry a prince,

81
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:36,883
like a modern day Cinderella story.

82
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:38,923
Hey, maybe I'm Cinderella this time.

83
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,223
No, Liz, Cinderella is blonde.

84
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,841
You can be Snow White
and party with the little people.

85
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:45,430
Oh, take me.

86
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,313
I can't take you.

87
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,101
I'm only getting in
because Donaghy's taking me.

88
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:51,353
Wait. You're gonna be
Jack Donaghy's date?

89
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,400
No. It's not a date.

90
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,230
Wow. Lemon.

91
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,650
I, uh, got you a little something.

92
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,862
Oh, my--Ow!
That really hurt my hand.

93
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,121
Dag! Who does that?!

94
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,333
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,622
Our car will be downstairs at 7:00.

96
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,213
Could you make sure
that she, uh, gets this?

97
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,121
Oh, yes.

98
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,463
Sorry.

99
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,880
This is definitely a date.

100
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,290
No.

101
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,842
Is it?

102
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:28,062
I didn't know
I was coming to this tonight.

103
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,892
Don't apologize.
You look great.

104
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:30,722
May I?

105
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,061
Uh, I got it. Thanks.

106
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,060
Careful.

107
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:36,102
Careful.

108
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,322
Thank you so much.

109
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,651
Let's see, um...

110
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,112
to us.

111
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,321
Is this a date?

112
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,573
What? [chuckles]

113
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,410
Lemon...

114
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:51,583
I date socialites and models
and actresses-- Liz Hurley in the '90s.

115
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,702
Fine. My mistake.

116
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,501
I think 's so funny
that you thought that.

117
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,671
Hi, Jack. Maybe I'll see you later.

118
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,420
I hope so. Her.

119
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,921
Her.

120
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,880
Her.

121
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,511
The two of them.

122
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,262
This guy coming up on my left--
his daughter this summer.

123
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,683
Wes, good to see you.

124
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,060
Pete Hornberger,

125
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,482
tonight is the night
we celebrate our bodies

126
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,982
and our minds.

127
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,562
Hit it!

128
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:33,911
Oh, hello.

129
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,660
Hi. How did you get in here?

130
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,212
Oh, Liz, if you dress well
and enter with confidence,

131
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,590
you can get in anywhere.

132
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,382
You showed the security guy your boobs, didn't you?

133
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,551
Just one.
It's not the White House.

134
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,260
Um, Chocatini, please?

135
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,262
You were dead wrong
about this being a date, by the way.

136
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,601
I just made a complete ass out of myself
in front of Jack.

137
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,052
Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:53,891
When I'm the Queen of Australia,
I'll have him executed.

139
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:54,562
Austria.

140
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:58,232
Yeah, that's what I said.

141
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,231
Ladies und gentlemen,

142
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,651
may I present His Royal Highness,

143
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,650
zeh Duke of Thuringia,

144
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,110
Earl of the Duchy of Westphalia,

145
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:13,045
Prince Gerhard Messerschmidt
Ramstein Von Hap.

146
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,174
Thank you.

147
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,592
Thank you, all dear friends
for coming to my birthday!

148
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,011
Wow, who's Snow White now?

149
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:35,722
7:45, and I'm still awake.

150
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,112
- That Gerhard is amazing, isn't he?
- Ah-hum.

151
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:46,241
Most people in his situation
would be angry with their family

152
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,491
for the centuries of inbreeding,
but not Gerhar.

153
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:51,452
He's too busy trying
to stave off infection.

154
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,122
Oh, my God.

155
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:55,623
What is she doing here?

156
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:56,293
Who?

157
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,543
My ex-wife.

158
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,752
Oh, I forgot, you were married.

159
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,382
Wow, she's gorgeous.

160
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,341
And surprisingly age-appropriate.

161
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,632
Damn it. I was told she was in Paris.

162
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,472
The party of the year, that woman turns up,
and I'm all alone.

163
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,553
Thanks.

164
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:11,052
Johnny.

165
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,183
Bianca.

166
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,681
Ah, it's been a while.

167
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:15,681
You look good.

168
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:16,473
Thank you.

169
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:18,601
Do you remember
my fiancé Vincent Foley?

170
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:19,642
Yes, of course.

171
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:23,362
This is my live-in girlfriend Lemon.

172
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,230
Elizabeth.

173
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:25,522
Elizabeth.

174
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,192
Hello, Elizabeth.

175
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:27,152
Lemon.

176
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:30,320
Nice to meet you.

177
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,081
And how did you two meet?

178
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:44,253
It was part of the Big Brother/ Little Sister Program.

179
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:45,501
Congratulations, John.

180
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:47,591
She's much sharper
than the last girl you had.

181
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,463
What was her name?

182
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,420
Beyoncé.

183
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,550
And unlike the rest of Jack's girlfriends,
I have all my original parts.

184
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,101
Oh, hang on to this one, John.

185
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,223
She's a keeper.

186
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:01,811
Mmm, yeah. I'm a keeper.

187
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,352
So now it's a date?

188
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:05,442
I thought I could never be your date, Jack.

189
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:09,863
I thought no one would ever believe it
because I'm so grotesque.

190
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,070
Thank you for not embarrassing me.

191
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,623
Excuse me, Miss,
but His Highness has noticed you.

192
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:19,293
Who, Gerhard?

193
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,251
Really?

194
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,420
His Highness is quite taken
und invites you to dine next to him.

195
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,210
Oh, wow. That's...

196
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,342
flattering.

197
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,303
Are you sure
that me meant me?

198
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:37,182
His Highness is attempting
to wink at you.

199
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,811
Oh. Heh.

200
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,021
There you are.

201
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:44,102
I need your help.

202
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,520
I've been asked to dine
with His Majesty.

203
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:49,482
Oh, well, if you're looking
to sneak out the window, it doesn't open.

204
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,482
I already tried it.

205
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,280
Should I say I'm still a virgin?

206
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,031
Wait. You're actually considering this?

207
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,661
Of course I'm considering it.

208
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,532
You know I've always
reminded myself of Grace Kelly.

209
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,872
I'm not gonna be gorgeous forever.

210
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:03,793
Who knows how long this show will last,
and I have no other skills whatsoever.

211
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,460
I need to find someone
who can take care of me.

212
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,213
Yeah. I don't think Gerhard
can take care of you.

213
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,501
And I can get past someone's looks.

214
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:11,551
Since when?

215
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,763
I'm an actress, Liz.

216
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,222
It would be my greatest role of all time.

217
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,841
You've already made up
your mind about this, haven't you?

218
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,262
Oh, you're right, Liz,
I should go for it.

219
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,352
You're not even listening, are you?

220
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,472
Poop. Monkey Butt.

221
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,852
No. You're a good friend.

222
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,853
And thank you.

223
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:30,863
You enjoying yourself, Pete?

224
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:31,940
Actually--

225
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,071
Actually, Tracy,
I'm trying to get some work done here.

226
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,283
Hey, Supersize,
take care of that dude.

227
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,700
That there's my friend.

228
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,162
Saved my life
when we was in Desert Storm.

229
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,453
Our tank broke down.

230
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,753
He killed 14 Germans
so we could get the hell outta there.

231
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:52,002
No. No, actually,
I'm just a producer on Tracy's show.

232
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,632
You're a producer?

233
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:54,423
Yeah.

234
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:55,633
I'm an actress.

235
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,840
Oh, yeah?
Have you ever seen the movie...

236
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:00,050
Secret Touchings?

237
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:01,811
I was a scientist in that.

238
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,853
No, I'm not familiar with that.

239
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,853
Your name sounds Jewish.

240
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,523
You must be important.

241
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,811
No.

242
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,611
Well, I just, you know,
I run the show.

243
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,362
Mr. Hornberger.

244
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:16,743
This is shocking.

245
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,742
Mind your business, son!

246
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,703
He's embracing his power.

247
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,121
Rawwrr.

248
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,203
Rawwrr. Rawwrr.

249
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,543
Hey, are you gonna come sit down?

250
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:32,291
Because they put out lobster tails,
and I want to eat yours.

251
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,132
Isn't she beautiful?

252
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:36,883
Yeah. What happened there?

253
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,722
I just couldn't keep up with her.

254
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,721
On any level.

255
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:42,853
Socially, it was a different party,
a different charity event every night.

256
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,973
I had to keep my tuxedo
in my glove compartment.

257
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:46,562
Sexually--

258
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,851
she wanted it four or five times a day.

259
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,601
And always standing up.

260
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,401
Standing up, what?

261
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,901
How does that even work?

262
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,613
You're kidding, right?

263
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,652
Yeah.

264
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,031
She left me, Lemon,
'cause I was never enough for her.

265
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:05,700
So now I keep it simple:
nothing but endless, meaningless one-night stands

266
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:09,673
with a carousel of super hot women
I couldn't care less about.

267
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,713
That's heartbreaking.

268
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,291
And her?
She just keeps getting better.

269
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,463
She's lost weight.
She cut her hair.

270
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:19,303
Look at her over there,
taunting me.

271
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,801
Seeing her so happy
and normal makes me crazy.

272
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,510
You've got to move on, maybe.

273
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:24,811
Is she coming over here?
She's coming over here.

274
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,101
If she comes over here,
I'm gonna do something.

275
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,641
Okay, come on.
Let's go. Let's go dance.

276
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,233
- Oh, no, no, no. No.
- Yeah, come on.

277
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,141
It's a fast song.

278
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay, easy there, Jackie Chan.

279
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,112
- Are they in? They're not out?
- Yeah, be careful.

280
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:36,691
Oh. Hee hee.

281
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,572
That tickles.

282
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:40,491
Oh, my dear Jenna...

283
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,413
you are exquisite!

284
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,582
Uh, Gerhard...

285
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,452
would you like to dance?

286
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:51,962
Sadly, because my body does
not produce joint fluid, I cannot.

287
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:55,460
But I would enjoy watching
you dance for me.

288
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,922
Oh...

289
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,921
all right.

290
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,472
Jazz!

291
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,681
Tap!

292
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,940
Jitterbug!

293
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,100
Charleston!

294
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:14,523
Ooh.

295
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:16,773
Interpretive!

296
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,652
Twirl!

297
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,191
Twirl again!

298
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,652
Keep twirling!

299
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:25,993
Everyone thinks I'm 5'5",
but I'm only 5'4".

300
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:29,121
Wow! That is an amazing story.

301
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,293
Yeah.

302
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,540
What are you doing?

303
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:34,002
You are a married man.

304
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,583
I'm not doing anything wrong.

305
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:37,712
Just--I'm just dancing, Kenneth.

306
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:42,301
Do you remember the movie, Footloose,
where those evil kids won in the end?

307
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,182
You're going to make a mistake tonight.

308
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,180
You gonna make a mistake tonight!

309
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,680
Remember the vows you and your wife
took in that church.

310
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,473
Botanical garden.

311
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,891
Botanical garden.

312
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,521
You promised fidelity--

313
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:53,771
Lick her face.

314
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:54,851
Think of God.

315
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,732
Look, both of you calm down.

316
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:01,113
I'm just trying to have some fun
for the first time in, like, ten years.

317
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:04,663
Ladies und gentlemen,
if you will please direct your attention

318
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:09,662
to zeh center of zeh room,
it is now time for zeh cake.

319
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:10,912
(attendees) Aw.

320
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,371
You're 25?

321
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:15,291
Yes. Can you believe it?

322
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,460
Finally old enough to rent a car.

323
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,922
Ahck!

324
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,380
Ahck!

325
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:26,183
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

326
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,853
Oh, boy!

327
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,853
* Happy birthd-- * Zum geburstag viel gluck *

00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,151
Go on.

333
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:43,533
Pbbbbbt!

334
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:46,153
Pbbbbbt!

335
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,203
Sie sprechen Deutsch?

336
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,371


337
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,252
Yes. Yay.

338
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:59,963
Is that Jenna mit Gerhard?

339
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,883
Bianca.

340
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:06,681
Happy birthday.

341
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,432
Thank you.

342
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:17,601
Vicky.

343
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:18,811
No. This is the men's room.

344
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:21,150
I know. I just wanted to talk to you.

345
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,653
Oh, no, no.
You don't need to do that.

346
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,153
We should get back to the party, right?

347
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:26,743
I mean, shouldn't we?

348
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,660
- Mr. Hornberger.
- I mean, right?

349
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:28,953
- The party?
- Mr. Hornberger!

350
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,532
Never done it
in a men's bathroom before.

351
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:34,413
Well, in this building.

352
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,000
Wow.

353
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,423
You're...

354
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,582
Smooth.

355
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,213
Mr. Hornberger!

356
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,091
Kenneth?

357
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:45,801
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life.

358
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,432
Don't do it.

359
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,263
Oh, I suppose you're gonna tell me
I should do it.

360
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:51,853
No. I'm just lookin' for the lobby.

361
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,181
But, yes, you should do it.

362
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:54,390
(Ken) No, you shouldn't.

363
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:55,720
Please think of your children.

364
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,933
Be a Samson!

365
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,233
You're a better man than this.

366
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,363
She's so smooth.

367
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,482
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

368
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,573
I love my wife.

369
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,703
My wife is not a Delilah, Tracy.

370
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,373
Hey, that's beautiful.

371
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,041
I feel you, Hornberger.

372
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,332
Who's that tickling my feet?

373
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,421
I'm gonna kick you in your face,
I know that.

374
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,292
Just water, please.

375
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,883
Are you going to marry him?

376
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,750
Oh, hi. What?

377
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,673
Are you going to marry Jack?

378
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:31,221
Uh...I don't know.
We've talked about it.

379
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,891
I can tell from the way he looks at you
that he's serious.

380
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,101
That's going to get you pregnant
right away, I'm sure.

381
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:44,731
A little late-in-life baby
he can parade around Nantucket.

382
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,993
The whole thing makes me want to vomit.

383
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, no. You know what--

384
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,032
I can take the models--

385
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,122
the Rockettes to Shakira--

386
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,372
because ultimately
I know they are going to leave him,

387
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,160
but you?

388
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:03,252
You can actually make him happy.

389
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:06,840
And that makes me want to sit on a knife!

390
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,920
Wow.

391
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:11,722
I hate seeing Johnny happy!

392
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,801
Uh...

393
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:16,681
Oh, boy.

394
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:17,563
Oh, Jenna,

395
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,233
this is almost like something
out of a fairy tale.

396
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,152
[chuckles] Yes.

397
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,731
Almost.

398
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,033
Great news. Great news.

399
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:35,201
Bianca is neither normal nor happy.

400
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:36,452
You don't have to do this, Lemon.

401
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,492
I'm telling you,
she's not over you.

402
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,121
And get this:
she was all jealous of me.

403
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:43,082
She busted out crying over it.

404
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,292
That's impossible.

405
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,383
Oh...fine.

406
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,543
You don't believe me?

407
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:47,672
I'm gonna go over there,

408
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,673
I'm gonna tell her that
you just proposed to me,

409
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:51,671
and you watch her.

410
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:55,890
Watch how red her face gets, okay?

411
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,523
Bianca, I have to tell you,
Jack and I are engaged.

412
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:02,681
Ah!

413
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,351
Aah!

414
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,522
Let go. Aah!

415
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,941
You!

416
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,571
What do you know?

417
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,043
Jenna...

418
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:28,093
I know we have just met,
but I think I love you.

419
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,961
Do you love me?

420
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:31,510
[muffled] Mm-hmm.

421
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,382
Oh!

422
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:38,222
Knowing I have the love of a beautiful woman
has set me free.

423
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:45,731
I think you just lost an eyebrow.

424
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,230
To freedom.

425
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,770
To us.

426
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,162
Thank you, dear Jenna.

427
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,120
And good-bye.

428
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:03,952
Good-bye?

429
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:05,413
W-why good-bye?

430
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,462
Who let him drink champagne?

431
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,963
He cannot metabolize zeh grapes.

432
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:12,132
Someone call Dr. Spuchemen!

433
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,340
Uh-oh.

434
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:15,593
I think she pulled out
a chunk of my hair.

435
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:16,800
Really? Where?

436
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,261
Oh, yeah.

437
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,603
We gotta boogie, gang.

438
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:25,100
Meine damen und herren,

439
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,601
zeh Hapsburg line...

440
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,980
has ended.

441
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:35,073
You can pick up your gift bags
at zeh coat check.

442
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:48,542
Hey, Pete, really inspiring
what you did back there.

443
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:50,003
You're strong now.

444
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,172
When your wife get home,
you gonna mess it up?

445
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,173
Actually, I think I might.

446
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,881
Let's go.

447
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,600
You goin' down, Pete?

448
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:07,391
Uh... I'll take the stairs.

449
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,900
Hold the door, please.

450
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:14,863
Mmm! You look like a baby.

451
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,153
Well, thanks for a fun evening.

452
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,412
Sorry your friend died.

453
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,203
When Gerhard was born,
the doctor told his mother and cousin

454
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,913
he would either live for 15 minutes

455
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:27,041
or for 100 years.

456
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:31,001
Boy, he proved them all wrong.

457
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,542
No, please, come in.

458
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,460
The look on Bianca's face
just before she choked you.

459
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,472
- That was the most satisfying thing.
- It was pretty good.

460
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,262
Oh, just to know that she's filled
with bile over me warms my heart.

461
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,510
Attaboy. That's the Jack Donaghy I know.

462
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,430
What are these, your bike shorts?

463
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,311
All right, knock it off.

464
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,062
Lemon, I want to thank you

465
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:52,690
for showing me that
I can have a pleasant evening

466
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,273
with a woman my own age.

467
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,072
I'm 12 years younger than you.

468
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,611
A woman your age, then.

469
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,993
Jack, wait.

470
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,580
Oh, my God. I thought you were--

471
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,620
Oh, good lord, Lemon, let it go.

472
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,791
That's never going to happen.

473
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:13,880
I've been with beauty queens--

474
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:14,790
Yes, I get it.

475
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,093
Pilates instructors, acrobats.

476
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:21,551
- Get outta here so I can take my shoes off.
- Come on.

477
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:26,101
I had "lunch" with Martha Stewart
and "dinner" with her daughter Alexis.

478
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,641
Gross.

1
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,840
On my stage? No way.

2
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,230
Oh,hey there, little guy.

3
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,360
What the hell? We have rehearsal.

4
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,830
- He can't tell me-
- no,no,no,no,no--

5
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,340
the most important thing is to know who
you can trust and who you can't trust,

6
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,270
and that man cannot be trusted.

7
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,980
What are you worrying
about? You have the job.

8
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,410
It's not over till it's
over. The game is still on...

9
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,350
and nobody plays it like banks.

10
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,310
Stay clear of him, little buddy.

11
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,980
Then after you carbonate
it, you drink it!

12
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,880
Sounds like soda pop.

13
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,990
Damn it! Why is leaving your children
a legacy that'll live forever so hard?

14
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,730
It's been almost half an hour.

15
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,050
Maybe we should take a break,mr. Jordan.

16
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,570
Yeah,I need to clear my thoughtcicles.

17
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,940
Which one of my two favorite
pastimes shall I indulge in?

18
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,880
Video games or pornography!

19
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,450
THICK THIGHS/ARMY GAME OF DEATH

20
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,420
That's it! Make a porn video game!

21
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,860
Hey,liz. Ight?

22
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,010
where's your buddy jack?
Packing up his office?

23
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,910
I don't know anything about
jack, so you're wasting your time.

24
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,910
So you don't know about him
accidentally selling nbc to some germans?

25
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,080
- Uh,no.
- Really?

26
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,910
'Cause rumor has it that he's
trying to pull a death spiral:

27
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Inflating the company's value, shorting
his own stock and then making a killing.

28
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,830
What--no,that's
completely not true.

29
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,530
Jack was nowhere near that meeting.

30
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,310
He wasn't even in new york 'cause he was
off with his girlfriend leaving me in charge,

31
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,340
so take that,liz.

32
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,040
Oh,god. That was so easy.

33
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,730
Like taking candy from one of those guys
who gives out candy at gay night clubs.

34
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,970
Oh,my god. Please don't say
anything. I'll give you kenneth.

35
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,200
Well,as enticing as that
is, I'm straight now.

36
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,140
I think that my future father-in-law needs
to hear about jack's little career killer.

37
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,110
Well,then he'll also need to know
about the security camera footage

38
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,220
of you cheating on his
daughter with another woman.

39
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,730
What?

40
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,210
No. No! No! No!

41
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,690
Oh,god!

42
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,850
You loved it!

43
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,180
A porn video game? It can't be done.

44
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,760
Look,tre, history's
greatest perverts have tried:

45
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,110
Walt disney,larry flynt, the japanese, but
they can't do it because of the uncanny valley.

46
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,490
Let me show you something.
Check out this chart.

47
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,890
You see, as artificial representations
of humans become more and more realistic,

48
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,140
they reach a point where they stop
being endearing and become creepy.

49
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,600
Tell it to me in star wars.

50
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,690
All right,we like r2d2 and c3po.

51
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,550
They're nice.

52
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,360
And up here we have a
real person like han solo.

53
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,780
He acts like he doesn't
care, but he does.

54
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,320
But down here we have a cgi storm
trooper or tom hanks in the polar express.

55
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm scared! Get me out of there!

56
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,000
That's the problem.

57
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,530
You're in the valley now and
it's impossible to get out.

58
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,100
That's where you're wrong.

59
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,690
I was born to design a video game where characters
get weird with each other for golden points.

60
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,820
My genius will not be denied.

61
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,110
I'm like mozart.

62
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,270
You're like that guy that
was always jealous of mozart.

63
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,090
Salieri?

64
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,130
No,thank you. I already ate.

65
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,710
You will not deter me.

66
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,110
The world is gonna remember
the name tracy jordan.

67
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,810
Well played,lemon.

68
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,880
To get through it, I
pretended he was a sandwich.

69
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,070
It's good to have you in my corner.

70
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,800
Hey,you know, I've always got your back.

71
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,460
Lemon, where do you see
yourself in five years?

72
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,130
Realistically,teaching
improv on cruise ships.

73
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,410
Lemon,I'm promoting you to head of east coast
television and microwave oven programming.

74
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,520
What? When did you get microwaves back?

75
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,560
You're going to be my successor.

76
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,930
No--no,I'm not
an executive.

77
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,280
Executives are,like,
huh-huh-huh. And I'm,like, haa.

78
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,090
I mean,I'm a creative person.

79
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,120
Sure,there are times when
my job is frustrating,

80
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,930
like when lutz calls in sick with
march madness, but I mostly love it.

81
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,540
This is the starting salary.

82
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,500
Suck it,monkeys! I'm goin' corporate!

83
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,930
Word is the board is
meeting later this week.

84
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,690
Guys must be close to making a decision.

85
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,010
I wouldn't know anything about that.

86
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,960
He guys,let's change the
subject to sucking at golf,

87
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,050
so donaghy has something to talk about.

88
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm sorry about that.
I'm a little nervous.

89
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,820
Don't apologize. You're a natural.

90
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,220
I'm feeling pretty drunk.

91
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,190
Well it's business drunk.
It's like rich drunk.

92
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,570
Either way,it's legal to drive.

93
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,500
all right,gentlemen,
we should do some work.

94
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,480
You suck,stan!

95
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,640
As you know, we've sunk a lot of money into
developing this new microwave start button.

96
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,100
It's been four years and $10 million.

97
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,320
I think it's time we pull the trigger.

98
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,200
What do you think?

99
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,810
I kind of like the old button.

100
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,050
Button classic. I love it.

101
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,720
Button classic? It's hip and homey.

102
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,770
Oh,my god,guys. We're crushing it!

103
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,440
Your first executive decision and you've already
saved this company $2 million in future r and D.

104
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,020
- But what if I'm wrong?
- There is no wrong.

105
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,570
Lemon,you just have to find a
subordinate you can push the blame onto.

106
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,810
That's why I love jorgenson here.

107
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,140
I think you're ready
to meet the old man.

108
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,490
- Jeez,jack,offer to buy a girl dinner first.
- classic lemon!

109
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,770
I've never seen you
like this,mr. Jordan.

110
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,460
This project is consuming you.

111
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,450
No,for the first time in
my life i know my purpose.

112
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,570
I'm doing this for my children.

113
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,230
My genius has come alive, like
toys when your back is turned.

114
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,770
I see the potential for
erotica in everything around me.

115
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
This cup,this table...

116
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,440
even you,kenneth.

117
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,060
Well,I am wearing a
cuffed trouser today.

118
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,890
Tracy,what are you doing?
They need you in wardrobe.

119
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm inventing a porn video game.

120
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,370
Let this man work! No
one is to disturb him!

121
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,410
Don't hold your breath, pete.

122
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,050
It can't be done or else i
would've solved it a long time ago.

123
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,860
Yeah,I would have.

124
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,140
Hey,nerds!Guess who's got two
thumbs, speaks limited french,

125
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,620
and hasn't cried once today? This moi.

126
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,000
Liz.

127
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,090
You can't be serious about
going off with donaghy.

128
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,570
How can you abandon me like this?

129
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,630
No,I'm gonna promote you outta here.

130
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,160
You're gonna be an executive!

131
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,350
I don't want to be an executive.

132
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,910
This is your starting salary.

133
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,920
I know.

134
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,050
Uh,don.

135
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,610
I'd like you to meet liz lemon.

136
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,940
Aren't you the gal who pioneered
the button classic campaign?

137
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,760
That was me!

138
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,850
Where the hell has
donaghy been hiding you?

139
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh,my blood sugar is dropping.

140
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,900
Liz,sweetie,can you run out to the
dessert table and get me something?

141
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,010
Oh,sure,but you should
know that I work for tips.

142
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,130
You got the charm and spark
of a young leona helmsley.

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,860
Is that-- is
he finished?

144
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,110
Not yet, but don't disturb him.

145
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,910
He can't keep going like this.

146
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,090
He was up for six hours straight.

147
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,360
My god. He's a genius.

148
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,380
Ugh,look at that loser,
sitting all alone and sad.

149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
He's like me yesterday. I hate him.

150
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,180
Oh,I don't know, lemon. I'm actually
starting to feel sorry for the poor bastard.

151
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,080
Hoo,boy,got your period?

152
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,810
Business drunk! More
business juice, please!

153
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,670

Oh,right--geiss!

154
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,140
So are you enjoying the party?

155
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,230
Wha--how
could I not be?

156
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,220
Just can't wait to take this
sexual energy back to kathy.

157
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,290
Banks,don't do this. Don't marry kathy.

158
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,530
- It may not be worth it.
- Why not?

159
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,640
We're absolutely perfect for each other.

160
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,030
She loves that I work out
a lot and talk to people.

161
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,410
And I love how she enjoys crawling into
cabinets and vents and other enclosed spaces.

162
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,510
Like behind the dryer, for instance.

163
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
You don't really love this woman.

164
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,790
Look how miserable you are
at your own bachelor party.

165
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,430
That's not why I'm miserable, you idiot.

166
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,430
I'd marry 1,000 kathy geisses to be ceo.

167
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm miserable because I know
that I'm not getting it. Yeah.

168
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,570
Geiss told me that it
was gonna be you,jack.

169
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,480
At my own sham bachelor party.

170
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,850
Mr. Geiss,I'm sorry it took so long.

171
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,060
Mr. Geiss?

172
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh,blurgh!

173
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,470
So go ahead,donaghy. Rub it in my face.

174
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,630
Normally I'd say, "I bet you'd
like that," but today I won'T.

175
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,850
Devin, I'm the only other person who understands
what you were willing to do for this job

176
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,100
and how devastated you must be
that you're not going to get it.

177
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,850
It's like when christian won project runway
even though rami was clearly the better draper.

178
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,090
Oh,god. I've got to
call this wedding off.

179
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,130
Devin, I just want you to know...

180
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,600
I hate-respect you.

181
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,010
And I you.

182
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,850
I think geiss is dead.

183
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,330
We've got to call dr. Spaceman.

184
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,900
Duet becomes a trio.

185
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,500
A trio becomes a quartet.

186
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,550
And on and on. Do you have it?

187
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,220
You go too fast!

188
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,430
I've given my whole life to porn
and he does it in one day! One day!

189
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,690
What's wrong with him,leo?

190
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,070
Well,to the untrained eye, he'd appear to be
what we in the medical community call "sleeping."

191
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,320
But he is,in fact, in a diabetic coma, which
could've been avoided by what we call "eating."

192
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,780
Do whatever you can,leo.
He has to wake up.

193
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,690
Okay. This is the gross part.

194
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,880
Ew,almost done.
Almost done--

195
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,730
Oh,damn it. That shot
was just a placebo.

196
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,140
I was hoping this was psychological.

197
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,420
He may not be faking it for attention.

198
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,160
Jack,have you seen don?

199
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,910
Oh,boy, that doesn't look good.

200
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,620
Don't panic,jorgenson.
It's under control.

201
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,400
He just has to say one sentence.

202
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,250
Couldn't you just,you know, inject
something right into his heart?

203
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,820
Oh,I'd love to, but we have no
way of knowing where the heart is.

204
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,370
See,every human is different.

205
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,700
- Jack.
- It's okay.

206
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,850
Don isn't feeling well.
He's in a diabetic coma.

207
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,400
- But possibly faking.
- How did this happen?

208
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,290
It was jorgenson's fault!

209
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,950
Fair enough.

210
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,940
It's all right. I'm in charge now.

211
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,630
You see,yesterday i met with don and he
said I'm going to become his successor.

212
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,410
So I'm the ceo.

213
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,400
Jack,if this is a power
grab, it's in very bad taste.

214
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,330
No,no,he said it. He told
me to keep it a secret.

215
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,170
No,it's true. I heard
it secondhand from jack.

216
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,370
banks! Banks knows. He can back me up.

217
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,470
Jack...

218
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,820
jack,I don't know what
you're talking about.

219
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,530
Oh,daddy! Daddy,no! Daddy!

220
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,860
Is it 4-1-1
or 9-1-1?

221
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,970
Uh,new york. Uh,diabetes
repair, I guess.

222
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,450
jack,I know you're mad at me.

223
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,700
Lemon,I am not mad at you.

224
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,340
Look,tgs is really where i belong.

225
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
- I'm not cut out to be an executive.
- Nonsense.

226
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,160
Granted,you almost killed don geiss.

227
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,700
But let's not forget, button classic.

228
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,270
Right,button classic. I crushed that.

229
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,380
So we both had a mixed
day. That's business.

230
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,890
Today the board is meeting and
I am still their best candidate.

231
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,280
And after I state my case, I'm sure they will
want to fulfill don geiss's pre-coma wish.

232
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,630
Oh,okay,great. Because I
don't think i can return this

233
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,620
'cause I got business sick
all over it when I got home.

234
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,330
Get out of here,banks.

235
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,600
I have nothing to say to
you before this meeting.

236
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,460
Then I'll do the talking
for the both of us.

237
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,610
Whaddaya mean,banks?

238
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,030
I'll tell you,jack.
There is no meeting today.

239
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,940
See,I convinced the board to have
an emergency meeting last night.

240
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,220
I tried to call you, but not on a
phone, so you may not have heard me.

241
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,750
Devin,what did you do?

242
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,380
I did what's best for the company.

243
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,210
You see,I convinced them it was best to act
quickly to quell any fears among investors.

244
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,540
And everyone agreed that,
for the sake of continuity,

245
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,420
the geiss family's steady hand
should remain on the wheel.

246
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:15,250
Of course,kathy's gonna need some
guidance, but that's what her fianc? s for.

247
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,350
No,this can't happen.

248
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,260
Oh,it's happening.

249
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,280
Now get out of our office.

250
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,640
I didn't hear hand washing!

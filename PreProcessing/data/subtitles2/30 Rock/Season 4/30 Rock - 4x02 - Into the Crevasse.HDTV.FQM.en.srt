1
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,310
I wrote that! I'm Liz Lemon.

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,600
"If your man is over 30, and still wears
a name tag to work, that's a deal-breaker."

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,680
But not you, Mike.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,340
That's not you.

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,140
Mike, leave my cutout alone.

6
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,230
Okay, you know, I'm gonna do
the same thing to your cutout.

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,850
Oh, wait, you don't have
one, because you're nobody.

8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,850
Blam-O! Another successful
interaction with a man!

30 Rock - Season 4 Episode 02.
Edited by He7LOW0RlD

10
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,530
Yes, Mr. Geiss, of course.

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,140
Well, I'll only be in D.C. for
the day, but if I find time,

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,300
I'll be sure to go see Fonzie's jacket.

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,010
You sit on it as well.

14
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,130
Hey, if you're going to D.C., I lost my
retainer there during a junior High field trip.

15
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,710
What can I do for you, Lemon?

16
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,090
Well, I wanted to give
you a copy of my book.

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,190
They used your blurb.

18
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,290
"Lemon numbers among my employees.

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,140
"Sir, your bus to Washington
leaves in half an hour.

20
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,500
You're taking a bus?
I have to.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,070
Ever since these buffoons from
Detroit took private planes,

22
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,810
the rest of us have to put on a show.

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,830
And now, your president-who, by the
way, is Kenyan and smokes cigarettes,

24
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,490
has created an industry task force
for microwaves and small appliances.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,330
Why? Do you need to be bailed
out with my tax dollars?

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,600
Even if they wanted
to, I wanted take it.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
It's corporate welfare, Lemon.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,190
Granted, the microwave industry
isn't what it used to be,

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,300
and the American love affair with the microwave
oven has cooled since its postwar heyday.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,320
* and she told her daddy she
was doin' the microwave ?*

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,130
* do the microwave?*

32
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,230
Did that happen?

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,520
But, unlike Detroit, we don't
need handouts or regulation.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm gonna go down there, talk
circles around these hacks,

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,340
and catch the afternoon
bus back to Chinatown.

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,330
Now, where was the last place
you remember having your retainer?

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,810
I took it out to eat astronaut ice
cream at the air and space museum.

38
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,360
Air and space...

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,440
If your man collects action
figures, that's a deal-breaker?

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,090
What? Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,500
Last weekend, I picked up this girl after
practicing Jedi moves in prospect park.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,130
Also a deal-breaker.
I took her back to my house on the handlebars of my bike.

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,440
As is that.
Snuck her inside, past my mom.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,380
Wow, that's four. She sees my mint-condition
Hellboy figurine and starts quoting your dumb book!

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,910
Also, my girlfriend is mad.

46
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,310
In Canada.

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,380
Ms. Lemon, would it be all right
if I only worked 20 hours today?

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,630
I'm volunteering at an
animal shelter later on.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh, of course. I didn't
know you did volunteer work.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,020
Oh, yes. I also help out at the pants
for zoo animals program and big brother.

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,510
Really? I did big sister in college. That
little girl taught me how to use tampons.

52
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,830
Oh, no, this big brother isn't
affiliated with the mentoring program.

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,960
It's an organization that secretly watches
people and makes sure they're behaving properly.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,180
Liz, I don't if you saw the
crawl on the TV guide channel,

55
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,790
but I've agreed to star in a sexy, supernatural
thriller in the vein of twilight and true blood.

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,100
Oh, that's good. The vampire
movies are hot right now.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,240
This is actually a werewolf picture that,
for tax reasons, is shooting in Iceland.

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,580
I play a moon scientist who's trying
to get to the bottom of things,

59
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,850
and who-spoiler alert-may
herself be a werewolf.

60
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,450
We start shooting tonight.

61
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,860
You can't leave. You
have rehearsal tomorrow.

62
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,310
Oh, well, why don't you get the
New cast member to cover for me?

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay.

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,680
Look, I know that you're mad about
Jack's decision to bring in another actor,

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,980
and you want to punish me.

66
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,210
Punish you? Please, Liz.

67
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,590
I've just always wanted to shoot a
student werewolf movie in Iceland,

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,970
where I'm filling in
last-minute for Victoria Beckham.

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,130
Or we could sit down and
talk about this like adults.

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,670
Liz Lemon! You booger face! I'm
gonna kill you with a bazooka!

71
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,860
I bought my wife that dumb book of yours, and the
more Angie reads it, the madder she gets at me.

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,180
Well, maybe that's on you, tray.

73
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,730
No, it's off me!

74
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,950
A book hasn't caused me this much trouble since
where's Waldo went to that barber pole factory.

75
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,590
It's on you Liz Lemon.

76
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,950
And you will be punished.

77
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,690
This'll take ten minutes.

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,830
Let's hit the meadowlands
racetrack on the way home.

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,310
I've got a betting system
based on horse penis size.

80
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,010
Is it true, Mr. Donaghy, that your executives routinely
used company helicopters to dry their home tennis courts?

81
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,340
Yes, and no. yes, that did
happen. No, it didn't not happen.

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,910
And that G.E. kept a party clown on
retainer with a six-figure salary?

83
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,820
When silly Willy's fee was amortized
over all birthdays company wide-

84
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,330
I'm being told that company money
is being gambled at racetracks.

85
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,470
Yes, but I have a system.

86
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,180
In 2007, a G.E. officer used corporate funds to throw
a cabaret-themed Halloween party on fire Island.

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,400
As I recall, that was you.

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,540
Mr. Donaghy, I am overwhelmed by
the negligence and incompetence.

89
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,700
It is an affront to your shareholders
and, frankly, to the American people.

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,440
Listen, Banks!

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Mr. Banks, you go and tell
your president the truth.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,510
We don't need the government
telling us how to run our industry.

93
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,150
I've heard enough.

94
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,050
Why do you have a gavel? This
isn't the congress.

95
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,500
I brought it from home.

96
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,980
Congratulations, Liz Lemon.

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,720
Now Angie wants a break.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,960
So instead of going to a hotel, or
my houseboat, which I cannot find,

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,090
I'm staying with the woman that
started this problem in the first place.

100
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,420
What? No. Tracy, that is not fair.

101
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh, yeah, there's a garbage bag in
the hallway with a reef shark in it.

102
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,770
Just put him in the tub with a reef.

103
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,900
What's for dinner
tonight? I want pierogies!

104
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,580
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able
to find homes for all these animals.

105
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,930
But, uh, you know, the
most important thing is that

106
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,720
you not become emotionally
attached to any of them.

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,770
I grew up on a pig farm,
sir, where all the animals,

108
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,030
even the birds that cleaned our
teeth, were workers, not pets.

109
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,060
I never even had a dog, 'cause, as
my mom would say, you can't eat love.

110
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,000
And as my mom's friend Ron
would say, "the donkey died.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,760
You're the donkey now, Kenneth.

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,750
Just another animal.

113
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,670
Might as well be a rat.

114
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,790
An adorable rat, who shows you it's
okay to be scared during a thunderstorm.

115
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,930
Why, it seems crazy to me to
even give a dog like this a name.

116
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,700
For example, bandit.

117
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,960
And that's Reggie,
and up there is digger,

118
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,630
well, the dogs scheduled to be put
down today have red tags on them.

119
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,600
I will adopt all of them.

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,160
Jonathan, call don Geiss' office and
Les Winkler in corporate communications.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,380
Tell Susan Cunningham,
Alan Junkin, Mark-Jack.

122
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,870
What took you so long?
Banks, you son of a bitch.

123
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,350
You know, revenge is a
dish best served cold, Jack.

124
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,070
Like...sashimi. or pizza.

125
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,350
You prefer cold pizza?

126
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,290
The morning after, it's the best.

127
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,660
Better than hot pizza? That's insane.

128
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,440
You don't tell me what
kind of pizza to like.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,330
You don't tell me
anything anymore, Jack!

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,170
It was a year ago that
you kicked me to the curb.

131
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,110
I began plotting my
revenge that very day.

132
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,390
I knew that I had to align myself
with something more powerful than G.E.

133
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,870
And since American idol is not on till
January, that left the United States government.

134
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,000
So I spent all last fall raising money,
worming my way into the Obamas' inner circle.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,140
Oh, my god, Malia, he did not say that!

136
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,080
Let's text him now.

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,010
After the election, I could have
had any ambassadorship I wanted.

138
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,230
Even to the world's
gayest country, Ireland.

139
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,490
Instead, I suggested that
I take on this task force.

140
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,010
See, I had you in my
sights the whole time.

141
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,520
What kind of gun was that?

142
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,780
It's a laser gun. It’s unstoppable.

143
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,310
You listen to me, Banks.

144
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,230
You keep your spray-tanned
little hands off this company.

145
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,210
Too late.

146
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,120
Your testimony's gonna make headlines in
every paper across the country tomorrow.

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,220
But...it wasn't a public hearing.

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,310
Somebody must have "weaked" it.

149
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,260
You did. You "weaked" it!

150
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,490
And I'm just getting started.

151
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,600
By the time I'm done, you're gonna make AIG
look like the Lehman brothers of microwaves.

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,750
You would destroy an entire
company just to get me?

153
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,050
Think of the pensions, the employees, the
kittens we use to test microwave strength.

154
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,690
Enjoy the view while you can, Jack.

155
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,620
You'll be here for
about three days, tops.

156
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, that's all I'll
need, Banks, you watch me.

157
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,710
I'll make this company profitable so fast, the only
headline will be, "Donaghy saves G.E., marries your mom.

158
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,440
“See you in a couple days, Jack.

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,640
Laser shield.

160
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,460
Tracy and Liz's
residence. Tracy speaking.

161
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,370
Tracy, it’s Jenna. Is Liz there?

162
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,820
It's Jenna, from work.

163
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,930
Jenna, it's 2:00 in the
morning. What’s going on?

164
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,850
Night stalkers has encountered some production
speed bumps that are complicating my schedule.

165
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,500
Well, I need you back by
Friday. What kind of speed bumps?

166
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, Iceland appears to have
a different sun than America,

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,500
because this one is not setting.

168
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,760
Ugh, yeah, of course,
'cause it's so far North.

169
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,150
And you probably don't know this,
because you've never played a moonologist,

170
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,180
but werewolves only come out at night.

171
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,560
Yes, I remember that
from the thriller video.

172
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,980
Too soon.

173
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,640
What is your plan, Jenna?

174
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,500
Well, evidently, as it gets later in
the year the sun will start to set.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm told tomorrow night we may get
as much as a minute of darkness.

176
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,470
Really? So you're gonna shoot this movie
one minute at a time, just to punish me?

177
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,370
Liz, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

178
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,850
What New cast member? Bye.

179
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,110
No, you...

180
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,110
What's wrong, roomie?

181
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,930
Well, two of my coworkers are driving me insane,
so I'm gonna kill them in their sleep tonight.

182
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,560
Tracy and Liz's. Tracy speaking.
Tracy, put Lemon on.

183
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,770
Hello?

184
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,790
Okay, as a single woman, would you be
more inclined to buy a New microwave

185
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,500
if it could be programmed
to ask you about your day?

186
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,970
Before you answer,
consider your loneliness.

187
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm hanging up now.

188
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,390
Now that we're all up, you want to
talk about the elephant in the room?

189
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,100
No, I don't. I don't even know
why you brought that thing.

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,200
I mean the figurative elephant!

191
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,650
Liz, I been reading your book.

192
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,230
Now I see why Angie's mad at me.

193
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,060
"If your man has seven cell phones,
but won't give you any of the numbers,

194
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,580
that's a deal-breaker?"

195
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,720
"If your man owns a diamond
necklace that says open marriage,

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,610
that's a deal-breaker!"

197
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,660
Liz Lemon, every little
thing I've done is in here.

198
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,560
You used me to write your book!

199
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,280
What? No, maybe some of
it is inspired by you.

200
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,250
You stole my life.

201
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,180
And you're gonna pay for it.
Really?

202
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,650
You're gonna make my life
worse than it is right now, how?

203
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,060
I'll take all of them.

204
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,910
Tracy and Jenna are like children.

205
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,350
And like children, you can't
reason with them when they're upset.

206
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,990
All you can do is turn the heat
up, pour some whisky in their juice,

207
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,520
and wait for sleep to save you.

208
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,110
Well, that's not gonna work for me,
because Jenna is immune to whisky,

209
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,180
and Tracy is afraid of juice.

210
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,670
Oh, and not to add to your
problems, but Paula read your book.

211
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,990
Attention, creative
types. Brainstorming Session.

212
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,660
Let's try to stop
mouth-breathing for one minute.

213
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,870
What is this?

214
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,220
It's an idea. An idea that started
this company, changed the way we live,

215
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,300
and made this country
great. This is Dinesh Mehta.

216
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,260
He's a design engineer
from the microwave division.

217
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,040
All Dinesh and I need from you is one
idea that is as good as the light bulb.

218
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,030
What?

219
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,740
I have two days to make
people buy a lot of microwaves.

220
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,290
Well, it's kind of annoying when
you're microwaving, like, a burrito,

221
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,820
and the burrito won't
rotate because it's too big.

222
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,950
It just gets caught against the
sides and the tray under it rotates,

223
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,370
but it doesn't rotate.

224
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,460
Bigger ovens. Americans
like big, yes. What else?

225
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,760
What if microwaves broke down more easily, so
people would have to buy New ones more often?

226
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,840
Yes, shoddier, excellent.

227
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,370
Bigger and not as well-made.

228
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,880
Wow, that sounds exactly like the philosophy
that almost destroyed the U.S. auto industry.

229
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,530
This isn't the auto industry, Pete. The auto
industry was run by a bunch of out-of-touch

230
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,670
White guys selling consumers
a product they didn't want.

231
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,060
We're G.E., damn it.

232
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,480
And we're gonna make a
giant, flimsy microwave.

233
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,950
Frank, I can't! If I make it any
bigger, the door will be too heavy.

234
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,550
Fine! Forget it.

235
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,850
Wait.

236
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,660
Say that again.

237
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,410
I said forget it.

238
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,530
For...get it.

239
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,620
Four smaller doors.

240
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,050
We'll crack this yet
"We’ll" crack this yet.

241
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,120
Wheel. Put wheels on it.

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,360
Nice.
Donaghy

243
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Okay, it's go time. Are you ready?

244
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,710
I'm in character and everything.

245
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,840
All right, let's do this! The sun
is setting! We get one shot at this!

246
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,890
Thank you.

247
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,750
And action!

248
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,550
Claire, I'm sorry. Which hand did I have
the flashlight in when we were inside?

249
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,890
The right! You had it in the right.

250
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,560
Thank you.

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,930
Cut!

252
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,980
Great day, everyone.

253
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,690
You guys are the real stars.

254
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,980
Since I have neither the time nor the energy to
even pretend that your situation is a real problem.

255
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,510
She doesn't like to refill the Brita.
I will cut the baby in half.

256
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,040
And I will take the top half. For
that is the part with the face.

257
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,900
Lemon, you wrote about
Tracy's life for your own game.

258
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,830
Tracy should be allowed to
use your life as he sees fit.

259
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,260
I'll have Jonathan call legal and
get a life rights contract drawn up.

260
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,910
Wait, what do you mean? Tracy
will own my life story?

261
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,910
What are you gonna
do with my life story?

262
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,110
Something humiliating.

263
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,710
Thank you, Jack.

264
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,620
Thanks a lot, Jack.
It's your only move, Lemon.

265
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,300
Sometimes the way back up down.

266
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,890
Let me tell you a story. It's 1994.

267
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,810
I went ice climbing,
and I fell into a crevasse.

268
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,130
I hurt my leg, and I
couldn't climb back up.

269
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,280
So fighting every natural instinct, doing
the thing that seemed most awful to me,

270
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,050
I climbed down into the darkness.

271
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,530
And that's how I got out.

272
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,630
And when I got back to base camp,
I went and found my fellow climber,

273
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:25,010
the one who had cut me loose after I fell, and
I said, "Connie Chung, you did the right thing.

274
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,130
Thank you.
Climb down, Lemon.

275
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,370
Climb down.

276
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,720
Hey, you're back.

277
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,820
Night stalkers is taking
a brief, permanent hiatus.

278
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, maybe now we can talk.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,100
Jenna, I'm your friend, no
matter what, and I will always

280
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,570
oh, Liz, I would really love to do this.

281
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,320
But I have to go home for the day.

282
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,800
Gotcha. So you're sticking with
the passive-aggressive acting out.

283
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
No, it's not acting out.

284
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,910
I have Mercury poisoning from
obsessively taking my rectal temperature.

285
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,240
And cup holders. Everyone
loves cup holders.

286
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay, I've been up for the last 50
hours, but I think this is a good idea.

287
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,970
Let's get rid of the oven entirely
and replace it with an AM/FM radio.

288
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,370
Okay, it's a car. We’ve
invented the Pontiac Aztec.

289
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,530
Thank you, Subhas.

290
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,860
You are the deal-breaker!

291
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,400
This is a Bill.

292
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,650
Tracy.

293
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,310
Hey, roomie. Did you order
pay-per-view at my apartment?

294
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,860
I'm willing to go splits-ies.

295
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,580
I'm not paying for any of this. You
ordered six adult movies in two days.

296
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,100
"The curious case of
Benjamin Butt." Lovely.

297
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,370
"I'm a do us?" What does that even mean?

298
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,290
That's a pun on Amadeus, dummy.

299
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,000
I will not be judged by you.

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,670
You caused this whole folderol.

301
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,000
Until you're adequately debased, you will
subsidize my predilection for erotica.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,330
Oh, yeah, and I used your credit card to buy
a vocabulary course from the teaching company.

303
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,920
So you're saying once you
figure out how to get back at me,

304
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,590
you and the dogs will
leave my apartment?

305
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,420
Affirmative.

306
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,020
I have to climb
down...into the darkness.

307
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,620
I know what you should
do with my life rights.

308
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,800
Pete, keep tours out of the
studio for the next couple days.

309
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,890
I need you to build a set that looks like my
apartment and get all the hand sanitizer you can find.

310
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,880
Wait, wait, why do you need Tracy
is producing a porno based on my life.

311
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,310
And I'm writing it.

312
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,540
I didn't think it would
end like this, Jonathan.

313
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,060
Not with a bang, but with a whimper

314
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,460
a whimper indeed, Jack.

315
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,000
I only came by to wish you
luck on your New venture.

316
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,300
What do you think that'll
be? Selling fake weed to NYU students?

317
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,820
I'll have you know that Barry Diller and I
are working on a whole New approach to media,

318
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,340
combining the digital - God!

319
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,900
Just let me drink.
See you around, Jack.

320
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,570
Thanks for letting me be such a big
part of you hitting rock bottom, huh?

321
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,010
Not yet, Banks.

322
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,490
I can go lower.

323
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,690
Into the crevasse.

324
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,740
What?
You played this all wrong.

325
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,470
You want to humiliate
me? You want to destroy me?

326
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,760
You should have walked
in here with a check.

327
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,730
Again, what?

328
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,350
Sure, maybe you've ruined my
career. Maybe you'll never see me again.

329
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:41,380
But if you had forced me to take
government bailout money, you'd be my Boss.

330
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,890
Oh, my.

331
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,590
You'd have to come down to Washington.

332
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,530
Report to me, like
a little school boy...

333
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,410
Your hands sticky from candy.

334
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,930
And the worst part is, I
wouldn't even want the money.

335
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,610
No, you wouldn't. Jack Donaghy
taking welfare? It'd kill you.

336
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,850
With so many jobs at stake.
You'd have to take it.

337
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,950
I'd make you. I'd make you take it all.

338
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,800
I'd roll over and let you give it to me.

339
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm honestly not trying
to make this sound gay.

340
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,220
No one is. It’s just happening.

341
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,900
One word to the president, and I own you.

342
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,310
I own this office.

343
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,600
I own that...fancy
little fellow outside.

344
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,490
It'd kill me.

345
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,210
But I'd do it for the company.

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,570
Hey Sasha, is your dad home?

347
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,580
What? You have to invite everyone
to your party? Even Zach S.

348
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,730
Everyone settle.

349
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,440
And action.

350
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,880
It's not just about the new cast member.

351
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,990
When you always put the show ahead of me,
it makes me feel like we're growing apart.

352
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,970
Jenna...you're my friend.

353
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,880
No matter what.

354
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,650
I will always look after
you. That's not going to change.

355
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:57,290
Oh, Liz, thank you for giving
me the hotter porn Lady.

356
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,840
Okay...we should get out of here.

357
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,790
Yeah, we should.

358
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,360
Everything good with Tracy?

359
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,550
Yea, I think so. And Jenna and
Frank and even Subhas. And you?

360
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,940
I live to fight another
day. But at what cost?

361
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, boy, I know the
feeling. What a week, huh?

362
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,080
Lemon, it's Wednesday. But
it's not all...

363
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,460
Bad news.

364
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,390
My retainer. Now my
dad won't be mad at me.

365
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,950
Take it out, Lemon!

366
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,670
You take it out, Donaghy!

367
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,300
Everything good with Tracy?

368
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,570
I think so, and Jenna too,
and Frank, and even subhas.

369
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,070
And you?

370
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,740
I live to fight another day.

371
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,220
But at what cost?

372
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,180
Boy, I know the feeling.

373
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,580
What a week, huh?

374
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,060
Lemon, it's Wednesday.

375
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,220
But it's not all bad news.

376
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,270
My retainer.

377
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,670
How will I ever thank you?

378
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,010
And cut. This is disgusting. Shut it down.

9999

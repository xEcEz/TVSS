76
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Okhvadwa your weapons -

77
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,700
The apostles
"Oh," Bob

Enough, live to fight day
Last and this nonsense?

79
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
They will not stop
Bastards now

80
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,300
If we stay here would not survive Believe me -
You have escaped -

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,200
I will work for a coward named

Strong and solid
And very handsome

87
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,200
That officer is
Normal, in fact

88
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
Strange that
Major still

89
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,900
But I attributed this to growing up
His father, a famous botanist

90
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,700
Gap and all
Around the world

This?

98
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Major

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,200
I think your position as a coach
Delayed slightly

115
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm going to do
Operations?

Radar is not it? -
Yes, it is a technique may Terbhana war -

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
And the problem is that
Germans also possess

122
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,500
German aviation draws
Objectives for wireless signals

123
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
While the pilots remain very
Working compass and the stars

124
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,700

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
German radar
Called Freer

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
Admiral allowed me to
The establishment of a commando unit

Small group
And the process

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,300
And what I want from you is the infiltration
To one of these stations

Tzbbwa and chaos and
Accustomed safety information

134
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,200

How much will I get a man? -
Leader and eight men and a specialist -

138
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,300
This process will not be
Unfortunately stemmed from officially sanctioned

139
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
And we have six
Weeks

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Deprive us any longer
Of landing at night

Perhaps they need to
To cease

151
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
How is

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,400
And not a coward, or on the run
Or a thief or rapist

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400

I have read about you
And did not really know your presence

198
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
I thought this kind
Of publicity

199
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,700
We can get out
From here

200

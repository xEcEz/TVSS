1
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,121
Ooh, meaningful eye contact
with Beau Brody.

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,609
- God, he's so cute.
- He is a God...

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,403
but that was hardly meaningful.
It wasn't even a two-second hold.

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:16,020
Well, maybe he's just shy. Ooh,
what if he asks you to fall fling?

5
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,081
Dawn, Beau Brody is the captain
of the soccer team.

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,637
A guy that far from the food chain
would never ask me.

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,188
I wear a penguin hat.

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,696
Okay, don't look,
but he is looking over here again.

9
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:30,029
Okay, don't look! Ooh,
what if Beau is asking Joey Donner...

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,468
if he and Chastity want to double date
with you and Beau?

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,364
God, you two would make
the cutest couple.

12
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:36,120
Hey, five-head.

13
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:42,263
That was my swimwear walk.
I don't think it works with jeans.

14
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:44,714
- No, it does.
- Thanks. So, listen...

15
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,334
you want to go to fall fling
with my friend Beau over there?

16
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,618
- Why? Does he want to go with me?
- Yeah, but he wants me to ask you.

17
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,737
He says he gets shy
around pretty girls.

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,027
Shut up.
He said that out loud?

19
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:59,356
I told you. I swear to God,
sometimes I think I'm psychic.

20
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,907
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

21
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:11,666
- No. No way.
- Please. This is momentous.

22
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,191
This is a milestone moment
in my young life.

23
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:17,835
My chance to finally have my first date,
and not just any date...

24
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:21,928
but a date to the most important dance
of the fall with the cutest boy at school.

25
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,934
I thought you said
Joey Donner was the cutest.

26
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:27,947
Who's not taken. I've had a crush
on Beau Brody all week long.

27
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:30,578
Ooh.
Have you picked out invitations?

28
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,991
Kat, I'm begging you.

29
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,922
I think Beau
and I could be soul mates...

30
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:38,579
like you and Patrick Verona.

31
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,888
Wow. You realize
this isn't sweet valley high, right?

32
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,489
You leave me no choice.

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,220
- Patrick?
- Don't you dare.

34
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,895
Please take my sister
to fall fling.

35
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,046
Excuse her. She was dropped
on her head as an infant.

36
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:52,271
Now she has these episodes.
Let's get you medicated.

37
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:55,673
Look, deep, deep down beneath
my sister's crusty exoskeleton...

38
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:59,380
- she has a soft spot for you.
- I'm going to kill you in your sleep.

39
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,028
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.

40
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,705
My father is a freak who won't
let me date until she does...

41
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,846
so will you please
take her to the dance?

42
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:12,583
You can consider it a charitable contribution
to the free Bianca Stratford foundation.

43
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,934
Okay, I'll do it.

44
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,235
- What?
- What?

45
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,978
I'll take her to that dance.

46
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,428
Even if you are serious,
what makes you think I'd go?

47
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,679
Don't ask questions.
Just say yes.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,674
I am serious. I'd like to see
how you look in a dress.

49
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,736
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

50
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:34,100
- We both have dates to the dance.
- Sleep with one eye open.

51
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:42,859
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

52
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,995
I'm bummed. Chastity and I aren't going to the
dance 'cause she's getting her gums scraped.

53
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,557
Uh-huh.
So tell me more about Bianca.

54
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:58,212
Oh, she's really cool. She's great at chemistry,
and she's got this really great face.

55
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:02,071
It's- it's symmetrical but not too symmetrical
'cause that could get boring.

56
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:06,281
Right. So she bought all that stuff
about me being shy around pretty girls?

57
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:08,462
Why wouldn't she buy it?
It's true, right?

58
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,770
Dude, I'm the David Beckham
of Padua High.

59
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:15,111
I don't need to be shy, but girls dig it.
It's nonthreatening.

60
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,369
Not cool, Beau.
Because of you, I lied to her.

61
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,209
- Hey, man, I'm sorry--
- She's a nice girl.

62
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,623
You better treat her right
or-- or I'll treat you wrong.

63
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:31,252
Jeez. Touchy, touchy.

64
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:36,219
Yeah, she can't be that sweet.
After all, she did sleep with Mr. Ross.

65
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,518
I plan on treating her right.

66
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:48,622
You're talking to Beau.
Ah, thanks for getting back to me.

67
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,316
Can I book a room
for Saturday night?

68
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:54,502
Two people.
No, no, no, no. One bed.

69
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,966
I mean, what do you really know
about this Beau guy?

70
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:03,691
He's cute, and he has
the best smile, and...

71
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:07,955
if I tell you something, do you swear
to never repeat it to anyone?

72
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,016
Sure.

73
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,819
This is going to be
my first date ever.

74
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,219
- This is your first date?
- Shh. Not so loud.

75
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,468
I don't want anybody
to think I'm Amish.

76
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,469
But, Bianca, your first date
should be special...

77
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,984
with someone who cares
about you and respects you.

78
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:26,973
How much more special can you get
than to go with the super-hot captain...

79
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:31,267
- of the soccer team?
- But are- are his intentions honorable?

80
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:35,756
We're going to a high school dance,
not colonial Williamsburg.

81
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,878
I don't know. I just have
a bad feeling about him.

82
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,717
I know. Why don't you cancel,
and we can go together?

83
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,066
Oh, you don't have a date.
Well, that's okay.

84
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:51,563
You can go with another friend--
Someone like, um, Benji!

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,108
Hey.

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,275
Bye, Cameron.

87
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:03,377
It's not see-through.
That's good.

88
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:07,593
Three inches above the knee.
Denied.

89
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,494
But, daddy, this is the sixth dress
you've rejected.

90
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:13,264
Why don't you wear that nice one
you wore to last year's school play?

91
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:15,811
It was my costume.
I was playing Helen Keller.

92
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:18,135
It was very flattering.
Even she could have seen that.

93
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,115
Hi, daddy.

94
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:21,248
Kat, I'll need to approve
your outfit as well.

95
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,280
- I'm going in this.
- Approved.

96
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,458
You can't wear that to the dance.
Patrick said he wants to see you in a dress.

97
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,290
- So I should give my date everything he wants.
- Give your date nothing he wants.

98
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,241
Come with me.
I'll get you fixed up.

99
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,654
- I don't need your help.
- You're right. What you need...

100
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:41,338
is a team of professional stylists,
but I'm what you got.

101
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,826
Patrick is going to love me.

102
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:48,214
- Bianca, that dress is still too short!
- I'll slouch!

103
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,314
Here we go.

104
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,256
- Uh-uh. This is scary.
- Don't blink.

105
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,726
Trust me, this dress will not
look good with an eye patch.

106
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:59,121
Why do women do this?

107
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:01,339
Do men say, "Oh, gosh, you know,
she'd be perfect...

108
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,743
if only she had black crap
all over her eyelashes"?

109
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:06,724
I finally get to make you over,
and you're sucking all the joy out of it.

110
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:07,832
Sorry.

111
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:10,567
Wow. I've been tuning
you out for so long...

112
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,522
I never realized
you're actually pretty.

113
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,943
Oh, my God,
I look like a princess.

114
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:25,009
This is my first date, and I'm so excited,
I think I might pee in my pants.

115
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,262
Please don't.
These shoes are open toe...

116
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,732
and unlike you, I actually have
realistic expectations.

117
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,929
- These things are never fun.
- How would you know?

118
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,164
You've never been to one.

119
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,765
It's Patrick.
He's here.

120
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:42,514
Wait till he sees you looking like that.
He is going to die.

121
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,444
Not if I die first.

122
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,577
- I should go save him from dad.
- No, wait.

123
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,485
You have to wait for your descent.

124
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:54,183
- What are you talking about?
- Your descent down the stairs.

125
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:58,163
There's one in every great movie,
like she's all that, the classic film...

126
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,435
about the pretty-ugly girl
who becomes pretty.

127
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,802
Coincidence?
I think not.

128
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:05,948
You realize you're not actually
living in a teen movie, right?

129
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:08,295
Be sure to go so slowly...

130
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,208
it looks like you're moving
in slow motion.

131
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,864
That will give him time to realize
he's falling in love.

132
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,660
Seriously, read a newspaper.

133
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,592
Wait.

134
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,019
Take this lip gloss just in case
he gets past your defenses.

135
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:48,089
This is the baby crowning.
Oh, this is what placenta looks like.

136
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:51,632
Here's the father cutting the cord.
Of course, that's only symbolic...

137
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,563
because he's responsible
for that baby for the rest of his life.

138
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,740
Got it.
Sex makes babies.

139
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,007
Are you done
with your inquisition, dad?

140
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:01,369
We have a stupid
teen cliché to be at.

141
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,037
I was just showing your friend
with the disturbingly deep voice...

142
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,825
who looks much older than 17
what could happen if he's not careful...

143
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:10,516
and by "careful," I don't mean, use a condom.
I mean, keep it in your pants.

144
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:13,568
Dad, I'll be home by curfew.

145
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:16,084
I'm so sorry.
His tourette's is acting up.

146
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:20,078
Okay, he just really cares about you.
Plus it's funny how fast he turns red.

147
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,812
It is, isn't it?

148
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:23,936
We taking my bike?

149
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,113
Please tell me he's talking
about his 10-speed.

150
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,981
We're taking my car.

151
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:32,230
Don't worry.
I have my stun gun.

152
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:36,694
Kat.

153
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,969
- Seat belts?
- Yes.

154
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:50,685
* Don't you
don't you wanna, wanna *

155
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,629
* Don't you *

156
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,081
* Don't you wanna
see me flaunt what I've got *

157
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,561
* Don't you
don't you wanna, wanna *

158
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,552
* Don't you *

159
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:08,063
* Don't you wanna
see me flaunt what I've got *

160
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,938
* Baby *

161
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:14,461
* Come a little closer *

162
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:18,157
* Come and get to know me *

163
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,349
* And what I've got *

164
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,198
Cameron, he stood me up.

165
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,094
* Would you come and save me? *

166
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,613
* Would you come and be with me *

167
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,245
* And see what I've got *

168
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:44,589
I didn't get to show off
this dress.

169
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:48,886
I didn't get to slow dance.
I didn't get my first kiss.

170
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:51,854
Beau is such a jerk!

171
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:56,554
He's king of the jerks.
He rules jerklandia.

172
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:02,136
Well, just because he ruined your date
doesn't mean he should ruin your evening.

173
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:06,367
He also ruined my Monday,
when I have to face everyone at school.

174
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,039
Bianca, this is crazy.

175
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,093
Let's go to the dance.

176
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,065
But this pity party's
just getting started.

177
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,091
The deejay's going to spin
some serious Kelly Clarkson.

178
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,174
Fine. Your loss.

179
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:22,466
But if we don't go to the dance,
you'll never get to see my sick moves.

180
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,321
- You have sick moves?
- Are you kidding?

181
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:29,552
I'm the conductor
of the hot tamale train.

182
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,608
I'm sorry, Cameron,
I just...

183
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,815
don't think I could do it.

184
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:39,823
If we go to the dance...

185
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,089
all they'll be talking about Monday
is how beautiful you are.

186
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,010
* Turn it up and let loose *

187
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:51,630
* Turn it up and let loose *

188
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,193
* Turn it up and let loose *

189
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,729
* Turn it up and let loose *

190
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,245
* Turn it up and let loose *

191
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:01,889
* Turn it up and let loose *

192
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,406
* Turn it up and let loose *

193
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,941
* Turn it up and let loose *

194
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:10,002
Wow. And I thought
school was bad in the daytime.

195
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,498
What do you think will happen first,
a conga line or the electric slide?

196
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,494
Pretty sure I feel
the "macarena"coming on.

197
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,895
No "macarena".
Darn.

198
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,165
Well, that's all right.
This is just as awkward.

199
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:32,664
I'd hardly call this dancing.
These kids are just dry-humping to music.

200
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:35,148
In that case, care to dance?

201
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:36,763
No way.

202
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,099
Oh, I see.
You can't dance.

203
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,991
- Oh, I can dance.
- Yeah? Prove it.

204
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,320
* That you can care
for someone so *

205
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,144
* You hold on tight
just to let go *

206
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:58,226
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll try to let you lead.

207
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,627
Oh, this I got to see.

208
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:06,455
* Just let me be *

209
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:09,595
* To walk alone
on empty streets *

210
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:13,284
Wow, I can almost forget
I ate lunch here yesterday.

211
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:18,417
- There will be other first dates.
- You're right.

212
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,802
Thanks for being so sweet.

213
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,687
I love this song.
Do you want to dance?

214
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:25,155
Thank God you're here.
I'm kind of on the fence about Eric.

215
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,689
Do you think eyeliner
is sexy or just weird?

216
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,574
Yeah, I think so, too.
Uh, so where's Beau?

217
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,739
- He stood me up.
- Oh, my God, we hate him.

218
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,211
- Tell me everything.
- No, wait...

219
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,525
- Hey, string bean.
- Hey, Benji.

220
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:49,002
* I found out
that nothing could please *

221
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:52,438
Wow. I think this is the longest
I've ever seen you quiet.

222
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,268
Ah, and there goes
a nice moment.

223
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,773
All right! Yeah!

224
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,364
Whoo!

225
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:05,430
- Yeah, I can't do this.
- Me either. You want to get some punch?

226
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,749
- Did you really just say that?
- Yeah, I did.

227
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,208
Okay.

228
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,513
Time for my sick moves.
You ready?

229
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:24,177
Oh-oh-oh, yeah.
This is called the roller coaster.

230
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,325
That is sick.

231
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,854
Or perhaps you prefer
to dance with an Egyptian.

232
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,664
I'll be your Cleopatra.

233
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:37,219
*Hey I've got the frequency
to turn you on *

234
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,517
- Why you got to be like that, baby?
- Don't call me baby. I don't like it.

235
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:44,074
You are my baby,
and I need babies to get strong.

236
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,540
Babies are smarter than me.
Want to make out?

237
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,924
So, listen, I never thanked you
for the other night...

238
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:55,703
during the fire.

239
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,948
Yeah, that kiss
was pretty good, right?

240
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:01,387
No. For rescuing
my mom's records.

241
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:04,126
Maybe you weren't raised
by wolves.

242
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,505
- Was that almost a compliment?
- Almost.

243
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:12,106
* I've got the frequency
to turn you on *

244
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:15,508
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

245
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,150
- And go where?
- Anywhere. The beach.

246
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:24,134
That's exactly what this dress
is missing-- Tenth.

247
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,842
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

248
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:31,012
Oh, don't be scared. I'm not
going to try and kiss you again...

249
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:33,171
not even if you beg me.

250
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,509
Don't hold your breath.

251
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,056
Meet me downstairs.
I've got to take a leak.

252
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,559
Good to know.

253
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:44,092
- By the way, I was right.
- About what?

254
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,388
About how good
you'd look in a dress.

255
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,910
* I've got the frequency
to turn you on, hey *

256
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,218
* Something you done
to keep it on, hey *

257
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:02,666
* Hey *

258
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:08,753
Step, step, step, cha!
Step, step, step, cha!

259
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,128
This is so cheesy
and so much fun.

260
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:18,569
* If we could live
in this moment *

261
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,954
* Then you would know *

262
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:26,313
* That every line I ever said
was meant to grow *

263
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:29,469
* I traded all of my chances *

264
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,162
* And now I see *

265
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,320
- Up close, you're really tall.
- Yup.

266
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:39,466
- Up close, your hair smells nice.
- Really?

267
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,567
It's this new shampoo.
It has jojoba oil in it.

268
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,393
Oh, wow.

269
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:51,036
Cameron, thanks for making me come.
You... saved my night.

270
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,908
I'm always here for you.

271
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,341
* After all this time *

272
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,215
* Now that I *

273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,333
* Have finally found me *

274
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:08,833
Bianca, there you are.
I am so sorry.

275
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:12,648
* Now the sun is shin... *

276
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,317
You'll never guess
what happened.

277
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:23,272
Look, I know you're mad.

278
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,489
This is me annoyed.
You don't want to see me mad.

279
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,840
I would have been there at 7:00, but some
stupid kids let the air out of all my tires.

280
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:31,052
- You could have called.
- I can't find my phone.

281
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,403
- I've looked everywhere.
- You couldn't find another phone?

282
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,920
I didn't have her number,
not like it's any of your business.

283
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,037
Don't you dare
talk to him like that.

284
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,056
While you were out thinking up
lame excuses, he was there for me.

285
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,806
- That's my phone.
- I think it's echoing off the walls.

286
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,583
- It could be anywhere.
- No, it's close.

287
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,665
- Just...
- Cameron.

288
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,254
Dude, you stole my phone?

289
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:05,849
Why would I do that?
I already have a phone, Beau.

290
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:09,045
It must've fallen in there.

291
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,092
Wait here.
Cameron, what's going on?

292
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,351
I overheard him talking
in the locker room.

293
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,828
He was planning on taking you
to a hotel room.

294
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,112
So you deflate his tires
and steal his phone?

295
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,743
Sounds a little crazy
when you say it like that...

296
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,003
- but I did it to protect you, Bianca.
- Protect me?

297
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,637
You ruined my first date, and I can
never have a first date again.

298
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,902
No, listen.
You can't trust him.

299
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,980
Can't trust him? I can't trust you.
I thought we were friends.

300
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:41,238
- We are friends, but I have--
- Just stay out of my life, Cameron.

301
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:43,849
Let's go.

302
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,957
Bianca!

303
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,882
Whoa-ho!

304
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,656
I'm so trashed, for a second
I thought you were Patrick Verona.

305
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,031
It's me, Keith.

306
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,827
Nice try.
You wouldn't come to a dance...

307
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,648
unless you're a narc.
Is this a bust?

308
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:07,649
I'm not a narc. I'm here on a date.
Do you mind?

309
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:11,342
No, actually, I'm glad you're here.
I feel way less lame now.

310
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:14,992
You want some? It's medical.
I have early stage glaucoma.

311
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:20,318
I told you
I smelled something illegal.

312
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,253
* It's getting much too easy
to resist you *

313
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,355
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

314
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,930
* And when you're gone,
it's hard to listen *

315
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,380
* All the tears I ever cried *

316
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,215
* All the lies you'd love to try *

317
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,915
* Everything's been said and done *

318
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,664
* You're out again
I hope you're having fun *

319
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,197
* Baby *

320
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,669
* 'Cause I ain't having none *

321
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,009
* Not gonna be
your plaything anymore *

322
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:19,631
- So, where do you want to go?
- I don't care. Just drive.

323
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,791
I do have that hotel room.

324
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,909
- Take me home.
- Okay.

325
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,896
- Are you up?
- Yeah.

326
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:54,335
I had the worst first date ever.
Boys are vicious, cruel creatures.

327
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:57,773
Remember that the next time
you watch she's all that.

328
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,720
- Why aren't you with Patrick?
- Who knows?

329
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:03,974
You'd have to ask him.

330
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:08,814
I saw you guys dancing with my own
two eyes unless I need glasses.

331
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:13,361
No, I could get sexy,
smart ones like Tina Fey.

332
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,467
- Are we seriously talking about eyewear?
- I'm sorry. Not important.

333
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,474
Let's talk about Patrick.
What happened?

334
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,803
I don't want to talk about it.

335
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,253
Got it.

336
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:31,227
I can tell you about my disaster
of an evening.

337
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,975
I don't want you to talk either.

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,089
Fine.

339
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:49,123
You know, dad warns us every day
about getting pregnant.

340
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:52,051
You're lucky.
He warns me twice a day.

341
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:56,630
Yeah, well, he never mentions
all the other ways a guy can screw you.

342
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,324
Amen, sister.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

Hate About You"...</i>

2
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:05,156
Stop seeing that dee
p-voiced man-boy.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,891
Dad, you don't even know him.
You're right.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,460
Invite him over for dinner.
You break up with him,

5
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:10,995
and I'll give you your life back.

6
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,997
If you don't come over,
he says we can't hang out.

7
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,500
You are nowhere near qualified
to see my daughter. Get out.

8
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,501
Get out.

9
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:20,771
Dad, we made all of that up.
You've been punked.

10
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:23,808
This past week with
you has been amazing.

11
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,176
You're not choosing me?

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,012
I broke up with Joey so
we could stay friends,

13
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,914
and then I got back
with him a second later,

14
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,551
because I realized real friends
would never make me choose

15
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,622
between them and my totally hot,
wonderful new boyfriend.

16
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,624
You said yourself,
you don't even know this guy.

17
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,325
If I learn he's bad news,
he's gone.

18
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:46,230
So there's no actual
meat in this meatloaf?

19
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:48,232
No, just lentils.

20
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:51,769
- -
- Please be a pizza.

21
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:01,445
Oh, it's Joey.
Watch this and learn.

22
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:06,317
I'm sorry, young man,
but if you'd like to see Bianca,

23
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:09,220
visiting hours are from 3:
30 to 5:00 on Tuesdays.

24
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,989
I've actually come to see you, sir.

25
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,893
It is my hope...

26
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:17,695
That you'll grant me permission

27
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,430
to date your daughter.

28
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,166
Here's my driving record,
vaccination card,

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,668
and a list of references.

30
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:26,671
They can't be-- Friends,
family or fake. I know, sir.

31
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:31,909
Did you put him up to this?
Good girl.

32
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:34,178
Let's go to my study
and make some calls.

33
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:38,316
If they all check out, I'll
need an itinerary for your date.

34
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,850
Is your phone GPS-enabled?

35
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,786
Wasn't that so romantic?

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,022
So romantic. Maybe they'll
negotiate your dowry while they're
at it.

37
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,724
How many camels do you
think you're worth?

38
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,626
You're just jealous. I'm nauseous.

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,863
It's the "Meatloaf". At least
Joey asked me out on a real date.

40
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:54,565
Has Patrick ever asked you?

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,868
Look, if I wanted to go on a date
with him, I'd ask him myself.

42
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,470
Feminism, ever heard of it?

43
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:02,506
isn't that the thing
that killed romance?

44

45

Thank God it's Friday.

46
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,158
Or, if you're an atheist, thank
the spinning rotation of the Earth.

47
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,160
I'm sorry, did I offend you again?

48
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:28,165
It's all right, I'm used to it.
Don't get me started on the pledge
of allegiance.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,333
Big plans this weekend?

50
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:30,835
I think I'll check out
this new documentary

51
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:33,838
on the private life of plants.
Sounds kind of scandalous.

52
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:38,609
You are one weird chick.
Have an educational weekend.

53
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,879
Maybe we can hang out.

54
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,353
Well, I am really busy, so if you
want to hang out, maybe we should
set a time.

55
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:51,489
Are you asking me on a date?

56
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:54,392
I'm just saying, if you give me a
time frame, maybe I can fit you in.

57
00:02:55,394 --> 00:02:58,429
- How about tonight?
- A more specific time frame.

58
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,731
Does 7 work, or will you be
watching your plant movie?

59
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,768
7's fine. It's a-- Deal.

60
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,452
<i>Oh, hey, Hacksaw Manor 4 opens
tonight. You want to go?</i>

61
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:24,455
Sorry, dude, it's the Sabbath.
No electricity allowed.

62
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,123
You never observe the Sabbath.

63
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,125
Nana's visiting.

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,995
Got to jet. Mom's making
me pick up the challah.

65
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,135
So where are you taking me tonight?

66
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,640
I'll give you a hint.
These are knives.

67
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,308
<i>We're going to see Hacksaw
Manor?</i>

68
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:45,443
No, Benihana.

69
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:48,479
He's taking her to Benihana?

70
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,648
That's where he took
me on our first date.

71
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:53,150
Okay, Joey's pathetic.
He totally lacks imagination.

72
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:56,821
<i>I'm bored with this topic. Hey, do
you want to go see Hacksaw Manor 4
tonight?</i>

73
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:59,490
As much as I would love to see
aristocrats torn to shreds,

74
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:00,991
I have a date tonight.

75
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,426
Fine. I know Janelle
wants to see it.

76
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,428
She hates aristocrats
because her family's poor.

77
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,430
Um, Janelle and her boyfriend
are busy tonight, too.

78
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,099
We're sort of going
on a double date,

79
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,767
but you could totally come, too.

80
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,436
And be the fifth wheel? No,
thank you.

81
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,438
I was invited to, like,
four different parties tonight,

82
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:17,108
and one of them is at
a celebrity's house.

83
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:21,779
I wish I could tell you who, but
the church of Scientology might
get upset.

84
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,114
Totes. All right, I'll see you.

85
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:24,482
Okay.

86
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:34,992
Mark this day in your calendar,
Bianca. I am asking you for advice.

87
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,760
- Burn them.
- I'm serious.

88
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,430
So am I. You can't wear
those on your date,

89
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,098
and you can't wear
that ponytail, either.

90
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,100
Guys only find those
sexy on cheerleaders.

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:48,205
A, what? And B, it's not a date.
At least, I don't think so.

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,741
You don't know? Would you
just help me pick the shoes?

93
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,377
Well, did you ask him
or did he ask you?

94
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,446
That part's a little unclear.

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,616
See, this is what you
really needed advice about.

96
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,784
Here's how you know
if it's a date--

97
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,220
If he's made a plan,
and if he pays.

98
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,590
<i>I'm sorry, did I just stumble into
Mad Men?</i>

99
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,994
Trust me, those women knew
when they were on a date.

100
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,229
I got your 911 text.
What's the emergency?

101
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,665
I can't decide between
these two earrings.

102
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,535
A true crisis.

103
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,404
- Daring or distracting?
- Way distracting.

104
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,239
That's what I thought.
Thank God you're here.

105
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:24,542
Come on, let's lip gloss.

106
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,511
Are you so excited?
Joey is such a catch.

107
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,780
And Chastity always
said he's amazi in bed.

108
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:32,816
Athletic, sensual and hygienic.

109
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:37,254
Oh, my God. Do you think
he expects sex tonight?

110
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,723
I doubt it. I mean,
it's the first date.

111
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,260
This may be California,
but we still have some standards.

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,396
Did you do it on your
first date with Mr. Ross?

113
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,463
Crap.

114
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:49,033
Joey still thinks I had
sex with my teacher.

115
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,601
Because you did.

116
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:56,040
Oh. You still think I did, too.
Um, look, Dawn...

117
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,109
Don't hate me, but I lied to you.

118
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,647
I'm still a virgin.
I was just trying to fit in.

119
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,984
Oh. Yeah, that makes more sense.

120
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:12,056
Oh, my God. That's Joey.
I should just tell him, right?

121
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,758
No. If you're honest now,
it might turn him off.

122
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:17,094
What if he tries to
have sex with me?

123
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,763
Don't panic. Just make out with
him like you normally would,

124
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,700
and if he tries to go further,
make up excuses.

125
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:27,905
Ouch, I think I pulled
my groin during Pilates.

126
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,607
Ooh, I think I'm
getting a cold sore.

127
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,642
Exactly. High school
boys are so stupid,

128
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:32,810
they'll believe anything.

129
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,478
And by the time you
tell him the truth,

130
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,413
he'll be so in love with you,
he won't even care.

131
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,949
Oh, my God, I love this plan.

132
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,320
And this is the baby crowning.

133
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:48,359
Wow. You never really think
about it, but it's a baby.

134
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:51,295
A whole baby that just
grows in there from scrah,

135
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,663
like a brownie.

136
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:56,033
A brownie that costs $250,
000 to raise.

137
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,635
And that's just in
the first 18 years.

138
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,638
If that brownie goes to college,
which it better,

139
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,840
you can tack on at
least $100,000 more.

140
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:05,743
My brownies will get
sports scholarships.

141
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:08,912
- You're missing the point.
- Hi, Joey.

142
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:12,249
Wow, you look amaze-balls.

143
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,951
I'm sorry, what?

144
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,586
Don't worry, Daddy,
it's a compliment.

145
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,954
Have her back by 10:00.

146
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,789
Remember what I said
about the brownies.

147
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,027
Don't get near her oven.

148
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,334
Hi, Patrick.

149
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,870
Have fun on your date, or whatever.

150
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,573
Hello, son.

151
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,878
If I come in, do I have to
watch the slide show again?

152
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:42,579
Yes, but we'll go
through it faster.

153
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:51,121
Okay, I have a last minute
surprise for you, Five-o.

154
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:54,191
Oh, goodie. I love surprises.
Should I close my eyes?

155
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,927
Sure. Just put this
blindfold on first.

156
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:08,105
So where should we head
for tonight's adventure?

157
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,141
I don't care.
I figured you'd have a plan.

158
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:14,211
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's go eat. Cool.

159
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,748
How about Hal's Steak House?
I'm dying for a rib eye.

160
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:19,750
You know I don't eat
anything with a face.

161
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,920
They usually cut that part off
before they serve it to you. You
don't say.

162
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,455
How about Vegan Nirvana?

163
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,424
No, thanks. I'll just chew
on a tree and save 20 bucks.

164
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,960
You know what? I'll just drive.
We'll find something.

165
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:38,902
<i>#  The boy meets the girl # <i
># Somewhere in a crowd #</i>

166
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,941
This doesn't look like Benihana.

167
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:48,946
Because it's my house. Voila.
I set the table myself.

168
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,281
I even cooked a dish I
invented for myself.

169
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:54,318
I call it chicken a la Joey.

170
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,787
And it's only 300
calories per serving.

171
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:00,457
Wow. Joey, this is so thoughtful.

172
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:03,560
Well, I really wanted
tonight to be special.

173
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,834
Don't move. I'm going to
get us the hors d'oeuvres.

174
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:15,005
Oh, I almost forgot the best part--

175
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,373
My parents are out of town.

176
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:19,076
We have the place all to ourselves.

177
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,479
Want to go somewhere
more comfortable?

178
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:35,283
Uh, sure, but do you think I could
have another piece of pie first?

179
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:40,522
Sorry, babe, you finished it.
Let's move to the couch.

180
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,163
Um, okay. You're so tense.

181
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:51,833
Really? I don't know why.
I couldn't be looser.

182
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,169
I don't mean that I'm loose.

183
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:57,439
I just... I'll give you a massage.

184
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:05,714
<i>Look, 20/20.
Man, I miss Ted Koppel.</i>

185
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:09,885
I'll record it. Just relax.

186
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,156
Did you feel something?

187
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,258
I think there was an earthquake.

188
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,430
Nope, didn't feel a thing.

189
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,679
Baby, what's wrong?

190
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:41,516
Do you have any aspirin?
I have a splitting virgin.

191
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,756
Finally. I'm starving.

192
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,091
We would have been eating
an hour ago if you ate fish.

193
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,793
Nothing with a face.

194
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:59,100
- This place is expensive.
- We're not going anywhere else.

195
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:02,204
Hi, my name is Winston. I'm going
to be your waiter. Can I take your
order?

196
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:03,705
Actually, we haven't finished--

197
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:06,374
Look, in 45 minutes, I got to
kick you out of this table.

198
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,043
We got some VIPs coming in.

199
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:11,980
So more time with the menu,
less time eating.

200
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:14,816
I'll have the chicken.

201
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:18,453
<i>The passion fruit poisson
or the fricassee?</i>

202
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,855
The first one.

203
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,690
And for the lady?

204
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,860
I'll just have the side salad.
And please don't call me lady.

205
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,396
- And for your entr?©e?
- That is my entr?©e.

206
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,166
Look, I'm just letting you know
that the side salads are side
salads.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,734
They're quite small.

208
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,704
That's why they call
them side salads.

209
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,639
Get whatever you want. I got it.

210
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,875
You sure? Don't worry about it.

211
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,413
I'll have the ginger chipotle tofu,

212
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,048
but without the chipotle.

213
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,084
Okay, just so you know,
that's not the way

214
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:51,086
the award-winning chef designed it.

215
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,089
And for your water,
sparkling or still?

216
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,292
Tap. Of course.

217
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,000
Actually, I'd like
sewer water, please.

218
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:09,037
I'm going to get you for that.

219
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,714
You know, Hacksaw Manor 1,
there wasn't enough blood.

220
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,484
Hacksaw Manor 2,
way too much blood.

221
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,519
Hacksaw Manor 3,
too many babies died.

222
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,726
Chastity Church?
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:32,961
Are you by yourself?

224
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:37,432
Of course not. I am on a date.

225
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:45,073
Okay, I can't really tolerate a
man screaming during a movie.

226
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,075
It is so unsexy.

227
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:52,314
So I told him to sit in the back.

228
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:57,352
Oh, that sounds exactly like you.

229
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:01,356
I'm going to get some popcorn.
Will you save my seat?

230
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,024
Oh, could you get me a hot dog?

231
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,192
Yeah, sure.

232
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:07,362
And some licorice.
Black. I hate the red.

233
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,030
And maybe some nachos.

234
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:11,366
But only if they
have nachos supreme,

235
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,569
but not if the nachos
supreme have sour cream.

236
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,704
Could I just-- Yeah.

237
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,707
- Yeah. - Is that all?
- And a diet soda.

238
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,276
And hurry back. You don't
want to miss the previews.

239
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,178
Okay.

240
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,458
Here you are, safe and sound.
And two hours before curfew.

241
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,360
Thanks for walking
me to my door, Joey.

242
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:40,595
Tonight was...

243
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:41,896
Great.

244
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:45,800
Dinner was amazing.
I'll e-mail you the recipes.

245
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,406
Up top, Five-o. Awesome night.

246
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:56,077
Joey, wait.

247
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:59,748
Are you sure you're okay
with me being a virgin?

248
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:04,019
Totally. <i>No problemo.</i>

249
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,854
Everyone's a virgin at some point.

250
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,223
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

251
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:10,892
Then can I have a kiss good night?

252
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:16,925
Sure. Good night.

253
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,879
I know the drummer
from Orchid Breeder.

254
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:31,980
Shut up. How?

255
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:34,182
This guy I know met him in rehab.

256
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,583
This guy I kvow. Was it you?

257
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,252
You got me. I'm a sex addict.

258
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:40,188
Oh, my God. I thought I
recognized you from group.

259
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,623
You were the guy
wearing the hoodie.

260
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:44,259
You should have seen what
I was wearing underneath.

261
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,660
Nothing.

262
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:50,031
If you hand me your card now,
it'll save time.

263
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,900
I'd like to review the check first.

264
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,006
Thanks, Patrick.
I'll totally get the next one.

265
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,777
Cool. But this time...

266
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:07,048
Run. Come on.

267
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:19,290
I can't believe you did that.
What were you thinking?

268
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,559
We have to go back
and pay that bill.

269
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:23,160
Excuse you.

270
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,429
This is not funny. That was wrong.

271
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:27,932
What's wrong are those prices.
Who pays that much?

272
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,568
All the other people
in the restaurant.

273
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:33,771
Lighten up. That waiter was a jerk.
What's the big deal?

274
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:37,008
The big deal is that I don't want
to commit a crime on our first
date.

275
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,243
Oh, I didn't realize
this was a date.

276
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:40,878
Neither did I,
until you offered to pay.

277
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,914
- Ah, but I didn't pay.
- Ah, yes, I remember.

278
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,916
Fine, this isn't a date.

279
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:48,352
What's your problem?
I thought you were cool with this.

280
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:49,687
With what?

281
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:51,522
With going on dates and
not calling them dates?

282
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:52,857
What's so terrible about a date?³

283
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:56,193
Because a date comes with all
these expectations on me,

284
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,528
and I didn't sign up for--

285
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,465
Are you okay?

286
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,606
Is something wrong?

287
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,043
It's not fair.

288
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,145
I know. They're just aristocrats

289
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,147
whose carriage broke
down in the wrong manor.

290
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:22,153
No, you idiot. My life.
My life isn't fair.

291
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:26,157
I dumped Joey, and now he's
on a date on a Friday night,

292
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:31,162
and I'm here alone.
I'm here, Chastity.

293
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,164
Exactly.

294
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,901
Oh, my life is such a mess.

295
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:40,504
Why is this happening to me?
I don't know.

296
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,174
Can it happen somewhere else?
We're trying to watch a movie.

297
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,311
Hey, hey, give her a break.
She's been through a lot.

298
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,793
Please tell me what
Joey did to you.

299
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,462
Can you just leave me in peace

300
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,398
<i>with my ice cream and my Sex and
the City marathon, please?</i>

301
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,534
Did he try to have
sex in your city?

302
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,805
I don't want to talk
about it right now, Dad.

303
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,640
Why didn't they make
you with an off switch?

304
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,209
Fine. Then I'm going
to call and ask him.

305
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:22,279
- I'll just get his folder.
- Nothing happened, Dad.

306
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:30,721
You really want to
know what happened?

307
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:34,158
At the end of our date,
he gave me a high five.

308
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,726
Are you happy?

309
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,164
Ecstatic.

310
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,609
- That was scary.
- So scary.

311
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:55,513
Who knew there were so many ways
to kill people with one hand tool?

312
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,482
Yeah. And if anyone
finds out about tonight,

313
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:01,152
I'll find one more.

314
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,099
Hey, Dr. Stratford.

315
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,435
I missed you, too. Is Bianca home?

316
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,104
She's in her room.

317
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:23,140
Just leave the door open-- And I
know you will, because you're a
good egg.

318
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:28,078
Look, Joey, I didn't mean to
overdo it with the slideshow.

319
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:30,948
You may kiss her good night.

320
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:35,753
- Chastely.
- Is that with or without tongue?

321
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,455
- Without.
- Okay.

322
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:48,465
- You okay?
- I'm never eating tofu again.

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Promise? Hey,
look on theright side...

324
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,039
Our first date was memorable.

325
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,444
But I'm not giving you
a good night kiss.

326
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,046
Your breath is seriously nasty.

327
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,252
- Oh, my god. Is she drunk?
- No, food poisoning.

328
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,690
Okay. Come on inside.
We'll get you some Gatorade.

329
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,625
Maybe pump your stomach, huh?

330
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:26,704
- Patrick, about the check...
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

331
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:31,275
- I'll take care of it somehow.
- Do not pay for the tofu.

332
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,356
Joey, what are you doing here?

333
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,692
I came to apologize.
I freaked out on you.

334
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:52,997
No, I'm sorry.
I should have been honest.

335
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:56,700
It's just-- I was expecting our
relationship to be an R-rated
movie.

336
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,603
Actually, I thought we
might even be NC-17,

337
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,373
since you slept with your teacher.

338
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,742
And then I found out we were PG,

339
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:07,711
and I uldn't remember
when my last PG movie was.

340
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:11,382
And then I was driving home,
and I remembered.

341
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,817
<i>Transformers 2.</i>

342
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,723
That's the last PG movie I saw.
And Megan Fox was so hot in it,

343
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:24,758
- And she didn't even flash a boob.
- Okay.

344
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:28,399
What I'm saying is is that

345
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,101
no matter what kind
of movie we are,

346
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:35,105
if we're going to be PG,
then you're my Megan Fox.

347
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,741
That is so sweet.

348
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:41,545
And over time, we can eventually
build up to being R-rated.

349
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,416
Cool. That works for me.

350
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:54,591
When you say eventually,
do you mean weeks or months?

351
00:20:54,592 --> 00:21:05,209

1
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,851
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi honeys.

2
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,800
Sorry I wasn't there this morning
to make pancakes for you, but...

3
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,580
you never know when Mr. Stork
is gonna pay a visit.

4
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:17,058
You realize we know where
babies come from, right ?

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,141
Do you realize where they come out ?

6
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:21,116
Trust me. Not pretty.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,335
It's the first day of school,
remember the most important thing :

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,678
Don't get pregnant !

9
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,228
I'm just saying. Boys want to put
a baby in you. Are we clear, Bianca ?

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,262
Well, they'd have to do it in vitro,
since I can't date until Kat does.

11
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:37,870
Then we're clear on the rules.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,416
I only make them because you
girls mean so much to me.

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,009
Your mother...

14
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,644
predicted what smart, beautiful,

15
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,505
young women...
you'd grow into, and how right she was.

16
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,590
She'd want you to know that.

17
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,884
- Thanks, dad.
- She'd also want you to know...

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,096
syphillis, gonorrhea and genital
herpes are on the rise...

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,431
- among American teenagers.
- Bye, Dad !

20
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,436
Push.

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,475
We're heading to high school,
not the Academy Awards.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,994
You never get a second chance
to make a first impression.

23
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,795
We're talking about teenagers.
They're impressed by shiny objects

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,599
Thus, my earrings.

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,660
You could just try being yourself.

26
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,859
Spoken like a true unpopular person.
That never works.

27
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,843
Using exhaustive Facebook, I've identified
the most popular girl at school.

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,752
I've then deconstructed her
profile and used that data...

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,892
to carefully plot out
our first encounter...

30
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,923
so as to easily befriend
and beguile her.

31
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,201
Beguile ? Big word, Shakespeare.

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,975
Pull over here.
I want to make an entrance.

33
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:43,258
Your door is stuck.

34
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,256
Your Highness.

35
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:57,992
How do I look ?

36
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,822
- Shallow.
- Thank you !

37
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,532
You're the one speeding
in a school zone.

38
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,263
Do you mind ?

39
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,946
This is my spot.

40
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,347
- I was told spots aren't assigned.
- No. They are assigned.

41
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:40,695
By Charles Darwin.

42
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,388
So, why don't you
and your dinosaur head to the back...

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,638
with the rest of
the extinct species.

44
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,215
Oh, my God.

45
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,492
My car !

46
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,019
My dinosaur wanted to
jurassic park here.

47
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:22,037
- Hey, sophomore.
- What are you wearing ?

48
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,862
It's the new look for the new Michael.
Goodbye, Mikey.

49
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,426
Hello, Michael.
Emo, hipster musician.

50
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,477
You played piccolo
in the marching band.

51
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:32,617
High school is how you spin it.
Even the biggest dorks can be cool.

52
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,622
As long as they play
their cards right.

53
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,488
- Look at Shia LaBeouf.
- I don't care about cool.

54
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:39,152
I just want a girlfriend.

55
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,883
every girl here remembers
that tornado drill

56
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:43,602
in 4 grade when I wet my pants.

57
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,267
Can I press pause on
this lifetime TV movie ?

58
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,807
This is our year, man.

59
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,854
Change is in the air. I can feel it.

60
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,553
Hey, Mikey.
What are you doing out of your locker ?

61
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:53,770
Hey, Big-A.

62
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:55,879
Back here on the senior year, I see.

63
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,220
Hear the new Fallout Boy yet ?
It slays.

64
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,307
It's really good, man. You should
check it out, they're a great band.

65
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,466
My locker hates me.

66
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:16,943
I could help you.

67
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,279
17, 13, 11.

68
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,722
Great combo,
you'll never forget this.

69
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,246
- Descending prime numbers.
- Yay, math.

70
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,332
You're new here ?

71
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,855
Yep, my family just
moved here from Ohio.

72
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,316
Well,...

73
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:37,750
if you need any directions,

74
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:41,043
class advice or,
or CPR, I am certified.

75
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,242
- My name's Cameron.
- Bianca.

76
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,352
Thanks a lot.

77
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,554
Love you.

78
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,526
This is a very serious matter.

79
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,300
Girls, tell me what happenned.

80
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,593
What happenned is this...

81
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,292
girl,

82
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,464
mauled

83
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,374
- my Mini Cooper.
- No,

84
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:11,560
I asserted my right to park.
Those spaces are communal proper...

85
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,941
Chastity, are you okay ?
Does anything hurt ?

86
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,710
My neck is a little bit sore.

87
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,816
Probably from
flipping your hair too much.

88
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,938
You should go see
the nurse right now.

89
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:22,863
After all, we can't risk our head
cheerleader having an injury just

90
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,945
days before the first pep rally.

91
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,761
Go, Penguins !

92
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,566
So, get out of here.

93
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:30,992
And have a wonderful first day.

94
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,057
What you did was dangerous.

95
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:39,920
Very, very, very dangerous.

96
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:43,272
I was going two miles an hour.
Not exactly The Fast And The Furious.

97
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,791
Listen, Carol... Karen... Katherine.

98
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:49,491
I can tell from your transcripts
you're gonna be a very effective...

99
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,870
activist someday.

100
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,764
I'm sure you'll really
stick it to the man.

101
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,271
But here at Padua High, the man...

102
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,537
is Chastity.

103
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:01,294
The daughter of the school
board superintendent.

104
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,817
This is a public school,

105
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:06,356
where every student deserves to be
treated with dignity and respect.

106
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,395
No. That's private school.

107
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,082
Here we keep Chastity happy,
so that we keep our funding.

108
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,692
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to kiss some ass.

109
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,453
Mr. Verona, what a surprise !
Come in.

110
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,527
Without the sharp object.

111
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,980
Personal space. Ever heard of it ?

112
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,860
What's she doing now ?

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,345
Other than looking beautiful,
of course.

114
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:42,981
She's taking off her shirt

115
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,020
Man, I figure they're a B-cup, tops.

116
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:50,317
I don't have much time before
her social status is determined.

117
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:53,510
It's like she's about to reach
into the sorting hat at Hogwarts.

118
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,748
Well, then get over there Harry
Pooper and pull out your wand.

119
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:08,790
What do I say first ?

120
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,252
Careful.

121
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:14,033
Go slow, all right ?

122
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:15,616
Sorry.

123
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,381
So brave.

124
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:22,823
Watch out.

125
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,850
I wouldn't want you
to fall in those...

126
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,233
fierce shoes.

127
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,792
- Marc Jacobs ?
- Betsey Johnson.

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,369
Besides, as my grandma used to say :

129
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,748
"I can't be caught dead
without my mascara"

130
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,078
My grandma used to say that.

131
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:37,039
No way.

132
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,664
My favorite ban it's Coldplay,
I love scrabulous.

133
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,461
And my dream car is a metallic
blue convertible Mini Cooper.

134
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,879
I'm Chastity.

135
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,195
Walk with me and tell
me your life story.

136
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,160
- Well, we just moved here from Ohio...
- Wow, great story !

137
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,106
You should try for cheerleading.

138
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,562
Too late. Voldemort's got her.

139
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,258
Not so fast.
All we need is a plan.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,906
- Your mom is at Wine Club tonight.
- It's scary you know that.

141
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,655
She gets a little flirty after...

142
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:12,741
But, tonight, when they're gone,

143
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,894
- we're gonna throw a party.
- The last party we went to

144
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,816
was a Bar Mitzvah. Yours.

145
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,125
If we throw the first rage of
the year we will be legends.

146
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,554
And Bianca will be able
to talk to you in public.

147
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,566
- My mom will be home at midnight.
- We call the cops at eleven...

148
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,964
they break up the party
and make it even more epic.

149
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,196
Come on. Picture...

150
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:35,696
greeting Bianca as she walks
into this raging party...

151
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,360
at your house.

152
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,310
- At my house.
- Yeah.

153
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,940
We're not exactly Clooney and Pitt.
How do we get people to come ?

154
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:46,275
Trust me.

155
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,632
I do.

156
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:01,582
Don't worry, I won't bust you.
Just had to get out of the lunch room.

157
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,985
Apparently, it's no longer socially acceptable
that you eat with your mouth closed.

158
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,336
What's your name ?

159
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,767
When you're a big time artist, I want to be
able to say I knew you back in high school.

160
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:13,158
Provided you're not
in jail for vandalism.

161
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,490
Mandella.

162
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,353
Who is Captain Intensity over there ?

163
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:28,025
Patrick Verona. People say
he knows the taste of human flesh.

164
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:29,453
Please.

165
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:32,473
He's trying to act mysterious
so he can get laid.

166
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:33,906
Watch.

167
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,799
Maybe we should stand somewhere else,
somewhere out of state.

168
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,393
There. Do you work
in any other mediums ?

169
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,407
- Favorite dog ?
- Labradoodle.

170
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,141
- Efron or Timberlake ?
- No contest. Timberlake.

171
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,770
- Project Runway ?
- Love it.

172
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,914
Want Tim Gunn to
officiate my wedding.

173
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,396
Well, we are so alike, it's scary.

174
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,674
Hold this.

175
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,569
Bianca...

176
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,592
this is Joey Donner, my boyfriend.

177
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,393
And Padua's starting quarterback.

178
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,237
Babe. I told you I don't know if
I'm gonna be starting this Friday.

179
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:47,086
Well, let's hope so,
because I don't date second...

180
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,216
I'll see you at tryouts.
I really hope that you don't suck.

181
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:56,765
She's a sprit fire ?

182
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,722
I can see why you love her.

183
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,159
Yep. She's the best.

184
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,849
- So I'm late for Chemistry.
- Well, I'm late for Chemistry.

185
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,235
After you.

186
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:18,859
Tabitha, go !

187
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,140
I'm Tabitha Cook,
student council secretary.

188
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,255
A new school year is upon us.

189
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,740
And you can just feel
the excitement in the air.

190
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,439
In order to get everyone excited,
we'll be holding...

191
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,733
Attention,
Padua High School students.

192
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,270
Is the end of summer
bringing out your dark side ?

193
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,684
Well, nothing cures the back
to school blues better...

194
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,773
than a kick-ass intergalactic party.

195
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:41,125
Right, Chewie ?

196
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:45,726
If you like to party, and you want
to do it tonight... text 555-0127.

197
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,914
Luke, I am your father.

198
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,569
Hurry ! If we get caught in here,
I'll get kicked out of the A/V club.

199
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,784
You're one of two members.
It's highly unlikely.

200
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:58,128
- You think it worked ?
- Yeah. It worked.

201
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,569
- Nice wookie, by the way.
- Thanks.

202
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,597
Megan ! Enough.

203
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,389
You all did really great
at try-outs today...

204
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,731
give yourselves a round of applause.

205
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:16,528
The reason
that we called today try-outs...

206
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,661
is because not everyone can make it.

207
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:20,872
If everyone could make it,...

208
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:23,181
well, they instead would
be called sign-ups.

209
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,167
And that means that some...
No,

210
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,792
Most of you won't make the squad.

211
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,839
Those of you who don't may
beat yourselves up about it.

212
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,698
Heck, some of you may regret
it for the rest of your lives.

213
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,968
You'll think back on, tomorrow,
when I post the list,

214
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,768
as the moment...

215
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,468
when it all went

216
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,366
wrong.

217
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,947
So, good luck.

218
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,652
Great speech.

219
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,351
Very inspiring.

220
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:04,340
But no one cried.

221
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:12,207
Sorry.
I'm expelling their loser energy.

222
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,381
After all, you and I, are winners.

223
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,932
There's Road Rage girl again.

224
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,908
Of the ten things I hated about today,
she is number one...

225
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,091
number five, and number eight.

226
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:30,040
Christ, will they allow
anyone into public school.

227
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,764
You're right. Dad's going to
kill us if we're not home for dinner.

228
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,002
Quit the charades
and get in the car.

229
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,439
See you tomorrow.

230
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,783
By the way, you look...

231
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,635
amazing in this light.

232
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,017
Amazing !

233
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:57,910
She hates you.

234
00:13:58,531 --> 00:13:59,703
I'm touched.

235
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,488
You've ruined my chances
at being popular.

236
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,988
I'm sorry, but that girl sucks.
She's a teenage Kim Jong-il.

237
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,226
Speak English, you show-off.

238
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,686
Kim Jong-il,
the dictator of North Korea. Dad !

239
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,605
North Korea ? So, what ?

240
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,632
I'm talking about our high school...

241
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,207
where I'm going to become unpopular.

242
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:22,957
My life is unworth living.

243
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:26,531
Yes. It's way worse than having
bound feet or wearing a burka.

244
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:28,761
- English !
- Enough !

245
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,988
Bianca, honey, look.
I know you're upset, but Kat's right.

246
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:37,667
Sometimes you get obsessed with popularity,
keep things in perspective, that's all.

247
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,237
- May I be excused ?
- Already ? That's like a record.

248
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:43,299
I don't need to carbo load.
I'm not running a marathon tomorrow.

249
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,660
- Thank you, dad.
- For what ?

250
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,082
For agreeing with me that popularty is
a shallow, superficial thing to pursue.

251
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,642
I don't agree with you.

252
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:55,018
What ?

253
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,874
What's wrong with being popular ?
I loved it.

254
00:14:58,377 --> 00:14:59,362
I loved being

255
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,237
captain of the football team...

256
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:03,443
president of the student council.
Any girl I wanted.

257
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,274
That was uncle Jimmy.

258
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,281
So, what ?

259
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,470
Look, the problem is,

260
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,134
it's the popular girls...

261
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,887
and the popular boys,
when they have S-E-X.

262
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,874
Could you get the parmesan, please ?

263
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,185
How much longer do I have to
use this thing in the house ?

264
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,257
Until you learn
that a car is not a toy.

265
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,931
- Today's actions could have much worse.
- Told you. It wasn't an accident.

266
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:36,413
Dad !

267
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,117
You bit me.

268
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,095
That's the first thing you learn
in my victims no more class.

269
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,927
Where are your car keys ? I have to go
to tell Chastity that you're adopted.

270
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,797
You are not taking the car.
You haven't even had Driver's Ed.

271
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,394
It's a big go-kart,
how hard can it be ?

272
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,308
Fine.

273
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,008
You drive me.

274
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,047
No way, Miss Daisy.

275
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:23,010
I'll tell dad you're not a virgin.

276
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,860
You have one hour.

277
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:40,539
See, I didn't realize the person
who throws the party

278
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,752
is also supposed
to supply the alcohol.

279
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,904
But I have a surprise !

280
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,591
Keg's here.

281
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,808
Courtesy of me.

282
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,939
Mike Bernstein, sophomore,
musician and legend.

283
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,414
Enjoy, everybody.

284
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,502
How did you get a keg ?

285
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:09,348
- It's non-alcoholic beer.
- My God. They're going to know.

286
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,315
By the time they figure out they're not
drunk the cops will have busted up the party.

287
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
- Yeah ?
- She's here.

288
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,148
- Welcome to my home.
- Thanks, Cameron.

289
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,154
- It's nice.
- I can't take credit.

290
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,750
I have an gay uncle
who dabbles at decorating.

291
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,620
This theme was Suburban Rainforest.

292
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,045
How fascinating.

293
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:35,017
Listen, do you know
if Chastity is here ?

294
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:36,837
I don't.

295
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:39,557
But I could help you look.

296
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,676
Enough.

297
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:09,906
All right, Hannibal Lecter.
Let's cut to the chase.

298
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,589
You want some of this ?

299
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,480
No ? Now, how about some of this ?

300
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,429
What do you want ?

301
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,009
What do you mean ?

302
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,214
I mean :
Do you want to deal me drugs ?

303
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,518
Or, steal my car ?

304
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,799
Or, harvest my organs ?

305
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,481
Why are people scared of you ?

306
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,900
Why are people scared of you ?

307
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,912
- People are not scared of me.
- Sure they are.

308
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,484
That's why I find you interesting.

309
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,622
Tell me more about liking Ohio.

310
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,754
Well, they have a good outlet mall.

311
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,829
Oh, fascinating. What stores ?

312
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,703
A little closet time ?

313
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,436
Is it true ?

314
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,981
I swear I never showed anybody
our video.

315
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:20,356
No ! Is it true that Tommy is starting
in Friday's game ?

316
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:23,380
Coach said I needed to work
on my three-step drop.

317
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,710
Which is what
you should have been doing all summer

318
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:28,708
instead of taking
those stupid modeling classes.

319
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:32,348
Maybe this is a sign
that modeling is my future.

320
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:33,936
Joey...

321
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:38,054
I am the youngest head cheerleader
in the history

322
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,663
of Padua high school.

323
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:42,457
My future is dating the quarterback.

324
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,504
Not a catalog model.

325
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,005
- Look, I could be high fashion.
- OK.

326
00:19:59,016 --> 00:19:59,938
Bianca ?

327
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,496
I thought that you were Chastity.

328
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:06,694
She thinks it's dumb that I want to be
a male model, but check this out.

329
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,070
You're really smiling
with your eyes.

330
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,124
Modelling is hard work.
I mean, I'm making it look easy.

331
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,203
People think it just happens.

332
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:18,922
I know how you feel.

333
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:21,775
You want to be a model too ?

334
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,417
- No.
- I mean, I think you could.

335
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:29,310
- You've got a great bone structure.
- <i>Why aren't you chasing after me ?</i>

336
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,951
- How dare you ?
- It's not what you think.

337
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,610
We have Chemistry together.
The class, not the other thing.

338
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,999
We match.

339
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,104
Get out.

340
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,463
Hey, how's the party ?
Right, buddy ?

341
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,281
Let's do this.

342
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:04,175
We're the world's last superpower

343
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,150
and yet we don't have universal
health care.

344
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,195
Are you talking to me,
or the Democrats in your head ?

345
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:13,977
Dad, have you seen
that box of old piano sheet music ?

346
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,244
No, honey. Why ?

347
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,028
Since I'm not going to be popular,
I guess I'll join the show choir.

348
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,014
Closeted gay guys are fun.

349
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,825
- She doesn't seem like herself.
- I know, isn't it great ?

350
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:30,396
Come on. Dad, she's obsessed
with what other people think.

351
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,873
Mom would not approve.

352
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,462
You know,
your mother saw Bianca's ability

353
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:38,503
to fearlessly dive into any social
situation as one of her best traits.

354
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:41,132
- She did ?
- She did.

355
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:44,414
She also loved your respect for others,
and your sense of fairness,

356
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:48,050
which is why I find it strange that someone
so passionate about universal health care

357
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:51,075
could lack any compassion
for her own sister.

358
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,386
You're good.

359
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,888
You're the one who played the dead
mom card. I just served it back.

360
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,946
Oh, my God, I love this part.
Seeing all their crushed, sad,

361
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:12,372
little faces makes me realize
how lucky we are.

362
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,286
And we should never forget it.
I'll meet you girls outside.

363
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm gonna do a second coat.
Build the suspense.

364
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:19,914
See ya.

365
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:23,146
- I love this part.
- I knew it.

366
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:38,194
I don't want to be a part
of any lesbian locker room fantasy.

367
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:41,561
- I'm here to talk about my sister.
- Oh, what a coincidence !

368
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:44,160
I was just about to send her
to social Siberia.

369
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,979
Look, Bianca and I are
completely different people.

370
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:49,659
I wanna be somebody,
and she wants to be... you.

371
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:52,537
Big deal, every girl on this school
wants to be me.

372
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,239
And the guys in show choir.

373
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,164
- Put her on the squad.
- Not a chance.

374
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,480
- Move it, Elphaba.
- Bring it on, skinny bitch.

375
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:06,702
What are you doing ?

376
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:08,803
Stop. I wasn't ready. It's morning.

377
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,193
I signed up
to be yearbook photo editor.

378
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:15,601
I'm sure that'll look really good
on your community college application.

379
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:18,396
Which means I'm in charge
of all the photos that go in it.

380
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,783
Put her on the squad,
or in every page

381
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:24,894
you'll be sporting a double chin,
a muffin top or cankles.

382
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,273
Freaky friends forever.

383
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,288
Bianca ! Hey.

384
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:45,656
Listen,

385
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:48,106
I think I was a little bit hard
on you.

386
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:50,219
After all, you can't help who...
or what

387
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:53,020
or what your sister is.

388
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,881
And Joey told me about his confusion.
He's confused. A lot.

389
00:23:57,267 --> 00:24:00,063
And I guess buying the same blouse
does show that you have good taste.

390
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,685
I asked a hundred people in Times Square
who wore it best.

391
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:04,715
You won.

392
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,575
I am prepared to give you
a second chance.

393
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,653
I'm a cheerleader ?

394
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,568
Not quite.

395
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:20,383
But, you can be the mascot.
Percival the Penguin.

396
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,669
- The mascot.
- Well, you'll be on the squad.

397
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,041
One of us. Only covered in fur.

398
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,800
Which means you don't have to worry
about fixing you hair color.

399
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:30,510
So, what do you say ?

400
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,252
Poor Percival.
You know he had two kids ?

401
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:46,264
No, I didn't.
But I do know the inside of his head

402
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,307
smells like a field of armpits.

403
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:51,121
Hey, at least
I made the cheerleading squad.

404
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:52,253
You did.

405
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,949
Happy day.

406
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:57,156
Now I can focus on passing French.

407
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,445
It's way beyond what I had in Ohio.

408
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,843
I could tutor you.
I mean, if you want.

409
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,368
You would do that ?

410
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,633
See ? I didn't get any of that.

411
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,534
You're a lifesaver.

412
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:15,479
See you tomorrow.

413
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,551
Adiós.

414
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,590
I mean, Ciao.

415
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:22,806
I've gotta learn French.

416
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:31,154
You guys could really be wearing
helmets.

417
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:35,756
Safety first.

418
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:42,801
Let's go before someone sees me
in this piece of crap.

419
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:47,003
Tough talk from the girl
carrying the giant penguin head.

420
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,131
I made the squad.
That's what counts.

421
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:54,043
It turns out, Chastity is a real sweet,
forgiving person.

422
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,721
Nothing like that Long Duck Dong.

423
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,513
- Kim Jong-il ?
- Whatever.

424
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,515
No more NPR.
It's giving me a menopause.

425
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:11,843
What was that sound ?

426
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:12,990
Justice.

427
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,533
You have got to be kidding me !

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

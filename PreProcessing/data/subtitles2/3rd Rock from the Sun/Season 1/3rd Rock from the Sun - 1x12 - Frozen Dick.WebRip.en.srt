1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,998
Guess what, you guys,
I got a new job.

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:06,686
Another job? Where?
- At Gung-ho videos.

3
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:07,892
My command
of the vernacular

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:10,704
impressed both Mr. Gung
and Mr. Ho.

5
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:13,100
Congratulations, Harry.
- Good for you, Harry.

6
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,828
It's freezing out here.
Dick, can we go inside now?

7
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:19,446
No, we're here to experience everything on
this planet, even the uncomfortable parts.

8
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:20,447
I have some
very uncomfortable parts.

9
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,442
They said on the news that
the dew point is dropping.

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,932
What does that mean?
- I don't know.

11
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,872
It just caught my attention '
cause it sounded kind of dirty.

12
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:33,557
Why do humans spend so much
time worrying about the weather?

13
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:35,981
They can't go 15 minutes
without getting an update.

14
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:36,982
Don't these people
have windows?

15
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,369
I cannot do a book report out here Dick,
my fingers are going numb.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,370
Can we please go inside now?

17
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,781
Absolutely not,

18
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,931
this is research. No one goes
in without a damn good reason.

19
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:56,857
Does anyone remember
what color our napkins are?

20
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,600
I think we should go check.
let's go find out.

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,279
Whew! I am freezing.
- Why don't you wear a longer skirt?

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,427
With these legs?
I don't think so.

23
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,569
Did you pick up
my tickets?

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,378
Yes, and your reservation for your
hotel in Chicago. There's your itinerary.

25
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,918
Nina, I can't believe
this is happening to me.

26
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,898
Not every anthropologist
receives this kind of honour.

27
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,996
I've worked my entire life
for this award

28
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,426
I know,
the Louis Leakey award.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,658
To stand in front of
a conference of educators

30
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,507
and express my thoughts
about my work.

31
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,385
This is going to be
the best weekend of my life.

32
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:13,617
Why are you looking at me that way?
- No reason.

33
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:15,338
Dr. Albright!
Dr. Albright!

34
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:18,701
Guess what.
You and I are on the same flight.

35
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:22,262
Same row, side by side,
strapped in at 38,000 feet.

36
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:24,316
Isn't that great?

37
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:28,114
Why are you going
to the conference?

38
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,105
They're giving me
some kind of academic award.

39
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,273
They hand these things out
like candy mints.

40
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,062
Once we get that out of
the way, the two of us

41
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:37,869
get to experience
the magic that is Chicago.

42
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:40,797
Well, once again

43
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:42,130
something wonderful
in my life

44
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,579
has been turned into
a giant crap fest.

45
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,824
What's the matter?
You!

46
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,585
I guess she's just saving up
her excitement for the crap fest.

47
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,970
You just don't get it, do you?
- What do you mean?

48
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,902
There are people
who have stress

49
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:57,637
and people
who give stress,

50
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:01,020
and you... are a giver.
- That's nonsense.

51
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:03,290
Dr. Solomon?

52
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,791
Well, come in, Leon.

53
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,576
Come in, come in,
come in, all the way in.

54
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,810
Can I have the weekend
to turn in my paper?

55
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,659
Leon, do you find that
I cause you stress?

56
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,090
Did someone say I said that?
- No.

57
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,470
It was all a
misunderstanding. I love physics.

58
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,537
I find it very soothing. I
don't know what you've heard.

59
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,744
Please don't fail me. I'll
turn the paper in by Friday.

60
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,484
That was a stress reaction, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

61
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:31,031
Thank you, Nina.
You've opened my eyes.

62
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,256
I'm going to make sure
that Dr. Albright's weekend

63
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:35,362
is stress-free,
hassle-Free,

64
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:37,320
and completely
without unpleasantness.

65
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,477
Oh, you're not going?

66
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,696
Oh, Tommy. What are
you doing here?

67
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:50,941
I thought you had that
book report due on dickens.

68
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,269
I was doing it,
and it was so boring.

69
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,773
I realized I could save myself a lot
of work if I just watched the movie.

70
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,352
I can't believe no kid
ever thought of this before.

71
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:03,666
I'll help you as soon as I'm
done reorganizing this place.

72
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,708
Why? What was wrong with it?
- It was a mess.

73
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,416
Everything was just
lumped together.

74
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,936
You know, all the "A's,"
all the "B's."

75
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,473
26 unrelated categories,

76
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,895
except for "x"
which has its own room.

77
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,644
Well, how does
it work now?

78
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,924
Things are much
simpler now. Look.

79
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,162
Good movies.

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,329
Bad movies.

81
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,005
Movies I haven't seen.

82
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:34,633
Pardon me, where
could I find "aliens"?

83
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,978
Nowhere.

84
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,681
Not here,
that's for sure.

85
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,768
Nobody here
but us humans.

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,070
Stop looking at me!

87
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,195
Do you really think this
trip is such a good idea?

88
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,642
Chicago's really far,
and I saw on TV something about a...

89
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:02,077
..low pressure front moving in.
- Low pressure?

90
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,340
That's exactly what
Dr. Albright needs.

91
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,585
Ah, there she is now.

92
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,194
This doesn't feel
right to me, Dick.

93
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:11,332
Separating from the unit for
an entire weekend is madness.

94
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,893
As first officer in charge
of security, I forbid it.

95
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,977
I'm high commander,
and I'm going.

96
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:19,029
Come on, why?
- Lieutenant, don't worry.

97
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm prepared
for every eventuality.

98
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,706
I think you're taking this
far too lightly.

99
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:26,651
You've never travelled here
before. How do you know what to pack?

100
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:29,385
How will I reach you in Chicago?
- I'm taking the phone.

101
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,816
You know the number.

102
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:34,331
Why are you taking
refrigerator magnets?

103
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:36,959
Chicago, the windy city?

104
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,794
I think it's obvious.

105
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,017
What do you mean?

106
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,048
Let's say
an urgent message

107
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,351
comes in for Dr. Albright,
and she's out sightseeing.

108
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:46,738
I lay it
on the nightstand

109
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,154
because I have no way of
securing it to a metallic surface.

110
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:52,162
A gust of wind blows it
under the bed,

111
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:55,254
and Mary never discovers
her long-lost identical twin,

112
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,140
all for want
of a magnetic banana.

113
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:03,895
That's exactly the kind of needless
agitation that I intend to prevent.

114
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,164
Understood.
Travel well, commander.

115
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,428
I shall return.

116
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,741
What are you doing?

117
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:24,161
I'm entering the pod.

118
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,385
For god's sakes, just sit
down and behave yourself.

119
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,799
Of course I will, Mary.
Here I am, sitting.

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,272
You just be calm.
Take a deep breath.

121
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,719
Welcome to
Northview Airlines Flight 604 to Chicago.

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,381
Oh, my god!
Out there!

123
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,627
There's something
on the wing!

124
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:47,164
It's an engine!
- This thing is a deathtrap!

125
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,103
Sky waitress!
Sky waitress!

126
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,802
Please be quiet
during safety procedures.

127
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:55,116
Safety? On this flying
donkey cart? That's rich.

128
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:58,017
How can this woman stay calm
when, at any second,

129
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,395
we could go careening out of the sky
in a flaming heap of twisted metal?

130
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:03,135
Sir, everything is going to be..
- At least give her

131
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,214
a gelatin-filled helmet
to keep her brain intact.

132
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,257
She's receiving an award!

133
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,308
Please sit down.
- No!

134
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,637
We're getting off!
Who's with me?

135
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,933
I've never been kicked
off a plane before.

136
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,763
Be grateful it was
still on the ground.

137
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:21,135
You could of least told me you were afraid to fly.
- Only on airplanes.

138
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,823
Instead of a 45-minute flight,
I have a seven-hour drive.

139
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,652
Don't worry. I've anticipated your needs,

140
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:29,129
and I'm ready to fill the
remaining six hours and 50 minutes

141
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,129
with mirth and merriment.
I brought "mad libs."

142
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,582
I need the name
of someone in the room.

143
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:39,497
Dick.
- Dick.

144
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:43,946
This is funny already

145
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,609
Look, it's
starting to snow.

146
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,813
Oh, my god.

147
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:51,468
What's the matter, haven't you
ever seen a snowflake before?

148
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,743
Yes, and I prayed
I'd never see them again.

149
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,621
Turn on the high beams.
They fear the light.

150
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,419
Where can I find
"remains of the day"?

151
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,369
Oh, that would be in the
"I didn't see it" section.

152
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,851
Wow, I've finally found

153
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:20,005
what I was looking for..
"David Copperfield."

154
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:22,520
It doesn't look boring.
He saws himself in half

155
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,503
and makes the statue
of liberty disappear.

156
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,194
Hey, look
out the window.

157
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:34,006
They're here!
They're here!

158
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,778
Albino brain chiggers!
Cover your ears!

159
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,572
Harry! Harry!
It's snow! Snow.

160
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,226
Oh.
- I learned it in science class.

161
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,920
Come on outside with me and I'll
show you how to write your name in it.

162
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,471
Oh, my god.

163
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,878
It's covering everything.

164
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,269
The whole town is
being obliterated.

165
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,133
I'm up here.
I'm up here!

166
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:10,329
Uh... okay, I know
the term paper's late,

167
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,801
but my car wouldn't st..
- Who cares? You're alive.

168
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:16,891
You're alive.
Who are you?

169
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:20,386
Oh, I-I'm a student of Dr.
Solomon's. My name's Leon.

170
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,401
I'm a sister of Dr.
Solomon's. My name's Sally.

171
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,264
Yeah, I know.
I saw you one day

172
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,265
when you dropped off
his lunch.

173
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,178
And then you went
to the dry cleaners,

174
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,891
and then to
the shoe repair place,

175
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,431
and then the car wash.

176
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,793
And then you went home and
read a book by the window

177
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:38,672
for three hours.
- I remember that day.

178
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,123
Listen, Leon, I don't want
to freak you out or anything,

179
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,912
but I think the earth is
spiraling out of the sun's orbit

180
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:45,621
and we're heading
for a new ice age.

181
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:49,692
Uh... did they say
that on the news?

182
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:53,336
No, but trust me,
I've seen this happen before.

183
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:57,213
We could be the last two creatures on earth.
- I don't know about that.

184
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,311
Our first responsibility
is to breed.

185
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:04,553
We must, must copulate
as much as we can.

186
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,737
Well, now that
you mention it,

187
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,948
I didn't see any people
on the way over.

188
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:18,589
Damn!

189
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,381
How are we supposed to
do it with the lights out?

190
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,979
A boy like that
will kill your brother

191
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,092
forget that boy
and find another

192
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:32,924
one of your own kind,
stick to your own kind

193
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,053
a boy who kills
cannot love

194
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,037
a boy who kills
has no heart

195
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,619
and he's a boy who
has no heart, very smart

196
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,725
oh, no, Anita, no, you should know.. ?
- Oh, my god.

197
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,884
Fear has made you hysterical.
- Oh, no, no, no.

198
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,342
I just like to sing
show tunes on long trips.

199
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,779
Before I found anthropology, I
was going to be a theater major.

200
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,584
Did I ever tell you
why I became a teacher?

201
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,220
I don't think this is the best time..
- Like all little girls,

202
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,722
I had a thing
for neolithic archeology.

203
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:01,894
My father used to cut up my barbies
and bury the pieces in the backyard

204
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,209
so I could
discover them.

205
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,463
Only problem was,
on my first dig

206
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,843
I discovered I was
afraid of skeletons.

207
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,708
Boy, it's really coming down now.
- Poor, sweet, tiny Mary.

208
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,138
You can drop the brave front.
We're under attack. Pull over.

209
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,647
What?
- I'm commandeering this car.

210
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:19,930
Oh no, you're not.
- It's a full-scale invasion!

211
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,269
I'll save you!

212
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,865
Are you getting the
feeling back in your hands?

213
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,966
No.
- Well, the walk wasn't too bad.

214
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:36,273
Oh, yeah, the last
four miles just flew by.

215
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:40,644
You plowed my car
into a snow bank.

216
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,741
I know.

217
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,221
And we thought it was going
to fight back. Aren't we silly?

218
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,714
If anything is wrong
with that car,

219
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:50,180
I am holding you
responsible.

220
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:51,736
We've got to
stick together.

221
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,868
The roads are closed.
And look around.

222
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:57,312
We're surrounded
by Neanderthals.

223
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:01,093
That's a fair assessment,
isn't it, fellas?

224
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,126
Are you
all right, honey?

225
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,858
Yes, I'm fine,
thank you.

226
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,466
You know, your boyfriend's
kind of cute.

227
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,240
Him?
- The way he spent the last hour

228
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:20,457
knocking himself out trying to get your attention.
- He's an idiot.

229
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,617
Honey, they're
all idiots,

230
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:26,755
but this one is looking at you like
you're the only woman on the planet.

231
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:29,040
Although you're real pretty,
you're not exactly

232
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,220
the last ham sandwich in
hungry town, if you get my drift.

233
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,952
Yes? It did?

234
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,746
Oh, my god.
Where?

235
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,426
And you're sure?

236
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,472
Thank you.

237
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,356
Mary.
- Hmm?

238
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:48,134
That plane that I got us thrown off of...
- Yes?

239
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,158
It never
reached Chicago.

240
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,833
Oh, my god!

241
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,831
Oh, my god! Oh!

242
00:12:55,832 --> 00:13:02,179
Yes, the airport was closed, and they
were diverted to Gary, Indiana.

243
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:12,457
Gary is 20 minutes
from Chicago.

244
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,699
Well, but it's an
inconvenience nonetheless.

245
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,953
I think someone
owes me an apology.

246
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,257
Okay, here are
our rations..

247
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,013
tuna salad
on whole wheat.

248
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:35,627
Sorry, all we have to drink
is this giant bottle of wine.

249
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,825
It has a modest bouquet,

250
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:41,753
but I think you'll be amused
by its presumptuousness.

251
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,793
Whatever.

252
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,378
Well, Leon,

253
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:50,805
to the survival of the species.
- Oh, hmm, yes.

254
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:57,393
Why are you nervous?
- Well, it's just that

255
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:59,670
I've never been with
a woman of your...

256
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,973
good-lookingness before.

257
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:05,080
Yeah, I know, I'm hot.

258
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:07,459
It's kind of exciting
for me, too.

259
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,857
All the men I've met have
been strong and decisive,

260
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:14,254
and you're neither
of those things.

261
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,435
Well, I can be, maybe.

262
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,907
Probably not.

263
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,598
Oh, Leon,

264
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,667
think what our offspring
will be like.

265
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:30,124
They'll have my skills
as a warrior

266
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,736
and your fierce
intelligence.

267
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:42,621
Dr. Solomon doesn't talk
much about me, does he?

268
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,768
I think you're just
trying too hard.

269
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,511
It's exhausting.
Nothing I do is right.

270
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,222
and believe me
I do everything.

271
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,053
You see, that's
your first mistake,

272
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:55,409
you see what I'm saying? Women
don't want you to do everything.

273
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,539
According to who?

274
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:01,124
Oprah.

275
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:05,466
Yeah, Oprah.
- So what do I do?

276
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:09,019
Well, you want to give her
what she wants when she needs it.

277
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,494
And you've got to try
and understand it

278
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,250
when she needs her
freedom to want what she needs.

279
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,594
Yeah, and if she's free to
want it when she needs it or not.

280
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,389
You see what we're Sayin'?
- Yeah.

281
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,446
What a man needs
to do is this.

282
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:25,310
You have got to pay
attention to what she likes

283
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,522
and share it with her.

284
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,096
You see what he's saying?
- You see what I'm saying?

285
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,098
You see what we're saying?
- Yeah, uh-huh,

286
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,886
I see what
you're saying.

287
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,963
But what does she like?

288
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,906
Oh, oh, oh!
I know the perfect thing.

289
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:41,565
No, she hates that.

290
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,500
Ooh, I know!

291
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,926
No, that made her
throw up.

292
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:50,529
It's hard, isn't it?
- It is damn hard.

293
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,312
Oh-hhh...

294
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:03,829
...klahoma where the wind
comes sweeping down the plain

295
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,830
don't even try it.

296
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,724
And the wavin' wheat
can sure smell sweet

297
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:16,969
when the wind comes
right behind the rain

298
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:21,401
oh-hhh-klahoma

299
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:25,216
every night
my honey lamb and I

300
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,681
sit alone and talk

301
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:30,106
and watch the hawk
making lazy circles

302
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,041
in the sky

303
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:35,169
we know we belong to the land

304
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,464
and the land
we belong to is grand

305
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:42,614
yippee-yi,
yippee-Yay, yippee-yay

306
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,616
and when
we say, yeow!

307
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,726
Ayipioeeay, yeow!

308
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,761
We're only Sayin',
you're doing fine

309
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:56,363
Oklahoma

310
00:16:56,364 --> 00:17:00,654
Oklahoma
o-k-l-a-h-o-m-a

311
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:07,242
Okla-hooo...

312
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,243
ma!

313
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,610
Yay!

314
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:20,517
I don't know why I was
so afraid of the snow.

315
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:22,564
It's actually
quite beautiful.

316
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:25,064
You know that slush
down in the gutter?

317
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:28,002
You call me crazy, but you put
a little cherry syrup on that,

318
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:33,274
you got yourself
a cool, refreshing treat.

319
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:35,868
Here, listen to this.

320
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,867
"Charles dickens' 'David
Copperfield' is an extraordinary book

321
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:41,723
about a man who accomplishes
many incredible feats

322
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,821
involving Claudia
schiffer handcuffed

323
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,615
in an underwater tank
with sharks."

324
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:49,240
That's good.
- Where are all the tapes?

325
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:52,921
Well, we had a big night,
but fear not.

326
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:56,569
We still got five copies
of "johnny mnemonic.

327
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,695
If that's not your cup of tea,
we've also got

328
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:03,266
"the making of
johnny mnemonic."

329
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,617
How about adult movies?

330
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,910
We got
"fat Fräuleins."

331
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:16,803
"A lusty romp through the
cheese and sausage shops

332
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,645
of communist east Berlin."

333
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,606
Forget it.

334
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,869
All right,
give it to me.

335
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,956
So then Freddy stivender
beat the crap out of me.

336
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:36,695
It was the talk
of the school.

337
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,158
I was so embarrassed.

338
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,235
But after weeks
of plotting,

339
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,869
I got my revenge.
- What did you do?

340
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,203
I had my mom
tell his mom.

341
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:51,242
I like your tactics.

342
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:54,727
You know, it may just
be the wine talking,

343
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:56,623
but I'm beginning
to think

344
00:18:57,714 --> 00:19:00,297
in a crazy world
like this,

345
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:01,747
you and me

346
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,743
just might make sense.

347
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,906
Hey, lights!

348
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:11,432
They'll be out again
in a second,

349
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,667
if there's a god
in heaven.

350
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:16,010
People are outside
shoveling snow.

351
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,367
We're not the last people alive on earth.

352
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:22,363
Leon, now we don't have
to sacrifice ourselves.

353
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:26,886
You don't have
to impregnate me!

354
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:30,021
Uh... oh, good.

355
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,968
Not to mention the ominous
behavioral parallels

356
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,888
between Australopithecus,
euralopithecus...

357
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,132
this is stupid.
- No! No, it's not.

358
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:49,249
So in accepting this award,
I must pose the question,

359
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,130
"has our journey from
primate to man finally concluded,

360
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:56,139
or has it just begun?"

361
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:00,055
Wonderful, wonderful Yes!

362
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:03,455
Excuse me, Dick, but
that road has been cleared

363
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,013
for a good half hour
out there.

364
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,857
Be all right if we just
scoot on out of here?

365
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,418
Sure. Sure.
- Thank you, ma'am.

366
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,047
Ma'am, I surely
am sorry

367
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,067
you didn't get to pick up
your Leakey award.

368
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:24,352
Oh, Dick, I feel
I owe you a thank you.

369
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:27,140
You certainly
made the time pass.

370
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,836
I can't blame the
weather on you. Well, I could,

371
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,405
but I won't.

372
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:36,009
Sometimes things just don't work out.
- Oh, I don't know.

373
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,535
Sometimes on the way
to what's supposed to happen

374
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:41,736
something even better
happens,

375
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:45,355
which is why I am pleased
to present you with this orb

376
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:48,171
containing a diorama
of the city of Chicago

377
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,584
in a state
of perpetual blizzard.

378
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:57,631
It's remarkable, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

379
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,293
And I have something for you.
- You do?

380
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:03,495
The crimson shovel.
- Oh, thank you.

381
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,963
Let's go dig out the car.
- Absolutely.

382
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:11,669
It should be easy to find.
I left the lights on.

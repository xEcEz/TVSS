1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,157
Aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,969
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,760
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,208
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,059
Earth is a place
where backing down,

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,555
causes equal problems.

11
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:29,042
Backing up causes
severe tyre damage.

12
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,276
What are you doing?
- I'm waxing the floor.

13
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:06,748
You know, it's nice to know that every
time I take some responsibility,

14
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:09,149
I move a step closer
to my promotion.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,211
You're on the road
to the top.

16
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:12,527
And I don't care who
I step on to get there.

17
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,528
Well, nice job, Harry.

18
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:17,910
Ha! Floor's so shiny,
I can see up my own dress.

19
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:20,908
That's enough.

20
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:23,389
Sally..

21
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:30,382
you touched my radio.
- No, I didn't.

22
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,185
Yes, you did.

23
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:34,186
I always leave it tuned
to big country 902.1.

24
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,945
I turned it on, and out
came mucho salsa 106.

25
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,934
Well, you used my leg razor
to shave your stupid face.

26
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,039
That's because the delicate
handle is easier to grip.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,920
Listen, Mr. Anal,
I am sick..

28
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,189
hey! Am I gonna have
to separate you two?

29
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,773
All we seem to do is argue
ever since we came here.

30
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,184
I don't want to talk about it.
- We studied nine galaxies in perfect harmony.

31
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,204
And we didn't leave
scuff marks.

32
00:01:57,556 --> 00:01:59,896
We seem to be annoyed
with each other.

33
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:03,039
And as fascinating as that
is, it's irritating as hell.

34
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:06,255
Sally?
- I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

35
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,514
I just got a shooting pain in
my head when you began to speak.

36
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,491
You know, August finds us
quite charming

37
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,658
in our naive determination
to stay together.

38
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,434
You tell your little girlfriend
August to mind her own business.

39
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,670
Yeah, and don't drink out of the milk carton.
- Fine.

40
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,050
Look at this. We're
failing here. We're a family.

41
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,156
We're supposed to be getting
along. We've got to work on this.

42
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,895
Could you please take this
argument off my linoleum floor?

43
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,739
Come off it, Harry.
- Harry, you know what?

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,013
I'll give you your promotion if you
don't say "really" in the next two minutes.

45
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:33,479
Really?
- You lose.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,273
Dick, she tricked me.

47
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:36,484
I don't want
to talk about it!

48
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:43,429
Well, I guess I just can't have
nice things.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,609
What are you doing under my desk?
- Sleeping.

50
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,467
Why?
- Because the top of your desk is hard and cold.

51
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:11,148
You do have a bed
at home, don't you?

52
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,488
Yes, but I can't
stand my house.

53
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,090
It's filled with......Family.

54
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:19,392
If I lived with my brother,
it wouldn't last a week.

55
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,391
You have a brother?

56
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,543
That's great.
Tell me about him.

57
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,621
Well, he hasn't quite
gotten settled yet.

58
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,217
I don't think he's
met the right woman,

59
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:30,900
not that women are put
off by him. Well, some are.

60
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:32,477
Most are.

61
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:34,730
What does he do?

62
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,130
Oh something different
every year.

63
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:39,276
Right now he's restoring houses.
I have a picture of him somewhere.

64
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,767
Is this him? What a gut.
- No, that's my mother.

65
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,258
That's Roy.
- Why don't you call him? I'd like to meet him.

66
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,635
We don't get together much.
- You don't get along?

67
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:51,082
No, it's just hard.
- Does he live far away?

68
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,365
From my house?
Three,... four blocks.

69
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,828
So you choose to have nothing to do with him?

70
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,355
That's not true.
- You don't see him.

71
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:01,015
Not very much.
- But you'd like to see him?

72
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,472
N-not very much.

73
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:05,115
Then I was right, you don't want to have
anything to do with him.

74
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:06,770
I didn't say that.
- Well, why don't you call him?

75
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:09,074
Fine, I'll call him.
- Yes!

76
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:12,327
We've been meaning to get together.
I'll ask him to drop by.

77
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,313
Wonderful.

78
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,562
And when he gets here,
just act normal.

79
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:20,545
I'd ask you to do the same,
but I'm afraid that ship has sailed.

80
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,071
Hello.  Roy?

81
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,363
Tommy, would you sign
my worksheet?

82
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,053
Sure. What
did you do?

83
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:35,572
Well, I pre-peeled
all these bananas

84
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:37,264
for eating ease.

85
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,279
Well, good job, Harry.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,169
Mangia.
Mangia.

87
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,473
Now I know
why I like you, Tommy.

88
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,713
You're always supportive
and patient with your family.

89
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:50,911
Well er, just the kind
of guy I am.

90
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:54,981
You spend a lot of time taking
care of other people's needs,

91
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,586
except mine.
- Yeah, well..

92
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,395
wait, am I in trouble?
How did I get in trouble?

93
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,715
You're not in trouble.
We're in trouble.

94
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,607
I really hope we
don't have to break up.

95
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,752
Break up? We're not..
when did we break up?

96
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:11,035
I just saying, I think it would be good if
we focused more on each other.

97
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,476
I'll show you focused. Let's
go to a movie Friday night.

98
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,070
I don't know.
- August, please. Please?

99
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,722
You're so needy.
- I'm sorry.

100
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,711
No, I like that
in a man.

101
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,438
No, Sally, I will
not apologise.

102
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,923
And let me
tell you..

103
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,324
hello? Hello..

104
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:42,088
Sally, I am the high commander, and
you are not allowed to hang up on..

105
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:44,756
hello?

106
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,548
Sally?

107
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:59,108
Dr. Solomon, this
is my brother Roy.

108
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,991
Whoa! Your head
is huge.

109
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,422
Oh, thank you.

110
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,624
Enormous!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

111
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,139
How do you get
any work done

112
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,457
with all these 18-year-old
butts waving in your face?

113
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,465
Oh, I try, I try.

114
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,082
So, tell me all about yourself.
- Well...erm..

115
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,648
It must be
fascinating restoring houses

116
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't restore houses.
I sell vinyl siding.

117
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:25,795
I think you under estimate
the effect vinyl has on houses.

118
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:30,145
Listen to her. She's always
bragging on me 'cause she loves me,

119
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,121
'cause she's my monkey girl.
- Don't do the monkey girl..

120
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:35,072
aren't you the monkey girl?
No, you're the monkey girl.

121
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,681
You want to hear the monkey sound?
- Please.

122
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:39,130
Please, not the monkey sound!
No-- Ow! No, stop.

123
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,520
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

124
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:43,811
This is wonderful.
Playful sibling aggression.

125
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,547
It's fantastic.
Please continue.

126
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:47,950
no--  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

127
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,988
You must be Roy.
We've spoken. I'm Nina.

128
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:54,270
Hey! It's nice to finally meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

129
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:57,139
Gosh, you don't sound
black on the phone.

130
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:01,057
It's just something
I picked up in spy school.

131
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,536
Ooh, he's nice.

132
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:07,919
I have a great idea.

133
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,823
Why don't the two of you come
over for dinner tonight at 7:00?

134
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,102
No, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:17,157
I think the monkey might want to go.
- Yes, yes, yes!

136
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,014
Oh, wonderful. Roy, you
are the perfect brother.

137
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:22,222
This is the guy you said
was a pompous ass?

138
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,326
That's me.

139
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,464
Sally, the albrights will
be here any minute now.

140
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,865
This is a special occasion.
Where's the salmon mousse,

141
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,026
the duck terrine,
the smoked chub?

142
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:57,881
You know, Dick,

143
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:01,093
I have a cleaver
in my hand.

144
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:03,489
I have a date with August. Don't wait up.

145
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,501
Oh, no. No!, no.

146
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:07,447
Dr. Albright
and her brother

147
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,732
are coming to dinner tonight.
- So?

148
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:12,311
You've got to see
them together, they're just..

149
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:13,884
adorable.

150
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:17,435
Their relationship is
everything that our family's isn't.

151
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,603
Well, can you just
take good notes,

152
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:22,454
because tonight is my chance
to get into Braville.

153
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,597
You can go to Braville
some other time.

154
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,548
hello!  Is it safe to come up?

155
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,034
Come on up!
Come on up!

156
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,583
Welcome,
Albright children.

157
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:36,771
Oh, allow me
to take your coats.

158
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:40,654
Dick, make a note of it. I am
taking initiative and their coats.

159
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:41,658
Good for you, Harry.

160
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,869
That's my brother Harry,
and this is Tommy, my son.

161
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,973
Oh hey, partner!
How're you doin'?

162
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,620
Hey, what's that?
A quarter?

163
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,861
Oh, I get it. You're
trying to impress a youngster

164
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,514
with what you think is a
mystifying feat of trickery.

165
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:01,988
He's a smart one,
this one.

166
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,037
Cut your hair.
You look like a girl.

167
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,070
Here. Sit down.

168
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,118
Everybody just make yourselves
comfortable. Let me have that.

169
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,460
Can I have a glass of that now?
- Harry, take the wine.

170
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:14,681
Wine taken.

171
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,126
Jordan H. Almonds!

172
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,769
You are one
beautiful woman.

173
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:22,791
Why does
every man I meet

174
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,079
have to remind me of that
like I'm going to forget?

175
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,431
Sally, as siblings,

176
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:32,056
Roy and Mary
are fun-loving and playful.

177
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,562
You know, Mary and I are
thick as thieves.

178
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:36,799
Hey monkey, remember the time

179
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,346
mom found all my "playboys,"
and you said they were yours,

180
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,147
and you had to spend
two years in therapy?

181
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:48,501
Harry, come on in here.
Let's all, uh...be sociable.

182
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,902
Here..
- I was sitting there.

183
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,400
Just..
just relax.

184
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,142
Interact naturally.

185
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:01,577
Okay, Roy, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you start things off by

186
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:04,442
telling us some amusing
family story?

187
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,727
Well, I don't know
how amusing this is,

188
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:09,901
but this is the most amazing
thing that ever happened to me.

189
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,386
No one wants to hear
your stupid story.

190
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,509
No, I think they do want
to hear my stupid story.

191
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,735
No, they don't.

192
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,922
Yes, they do want
to hear my stupid story.

193
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,294
this is fascinating. Roy, Roy, Roy!

194
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:27,607
Please continue.

195
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,462
You're going to think
I'm crazy, but...

196
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:36,497
I was once... abducted
by an alien spacecraft.

197
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:46,727
Excuse us.

198
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,078
you promised you
wouldn't talk about that.

199
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,226
No, I promised I wouldn't talk
about your chin implant.

200
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,833
No, no, no!
We're not killing anyone.

201
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,777
Spacecraft, you say?

202
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,624
I guess a layman

203
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,292
would call it
an abduction,

204
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,824
but what those space people
did to me that night

205
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:22,437
was more of
a spiritual kidnapping.

206
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,396
Yeah, right, aliens travelled billions
of light years through space

207
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:35,031
to ram a probe up
Roy Albright's butt.

208
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,825
Tell us about
the space people, Roy.

209
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,876
I'm driving along the road
one night really late,

210
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:45,172
and then I pull off
into this cornfield.

211
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,447
And then all of a sudden,

212
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,605
I see this rip
in the atmosphere.

213
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,089
And then hovering
right over my head

214
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,593
is this giant
hovering thing.

215
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,619
It was
a weather balloon.

216
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:07,787
Except weather balloons don't
poke you in the eyes with needles.

217
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,408
Well, that doesn't sound
like anyone we know.

218
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:17,194
I mean...."we know".

219
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:18,762
Go on.

220
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,012
I'm in the spaceship,

221
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,165
and I'm surrounded
by all this...

222
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,971
foam?

223
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,050
Exactly.

224
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,687
Roy, you were never
in a spaceship.

225
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:30,287
I was in a spaceship and I
have the scars to prove it!

226
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:33,116
Roy lewis Albright, if you
have one decent bone in your body,

227
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,457
you will not
do this to me.

228
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,749
So, anyway,
you can see where they are.

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,712
that's it, no more.
I need some air.

230
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:43,012
Dr. Albright!
- Let her go, Dick. Go on, Roy.

231
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,489
Well the next thing I know,
I'm being sucked up

232
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,633
inside this big hose.

233
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,136
the big hose?
- the big hose.

234
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,882
Roy, will you excuse us?

235
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:00,986
Now we have to kill him.
- You are overreacting.

236
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,148
Dick, he could turn us in.

237
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,197
Do you really want
to be the subject of

238
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,578
some alien autopsy show
on the fox network?

239
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:08,629
You're jumping
to conclusions.

240
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,207
And fox is
not a network.

241
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,624
We don't have
all the facts yet.

242
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,045
Dick I'm in charge of security,
and I say we kill him.

243
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,045
Well I'm the high commander,

244
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,755
and I'm putting
this decision on hold.

245
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,015
I'm going to check on Dr.
Albright. You go entertain Roy!

246
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,141
I'll pull a quarter
out of his ear.

247
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,862
I'll pull his brain
out of his ear.

248
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,948
You all right?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,187
I'm sorry about Roy. I told
him not to tell that story,

250
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:40,178
but he never does anything I ask.
- That's Sally all over.

251
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,652
It's hard being the oldest. They
think we're trying to run their lives.

252
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,762
When all we're trying
to do is control them.

253
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:49,616
Do you think that Roy...

254
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:53,097
actually was...
abducted by aliens?

255
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,253
No,

256
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,710
but I prayed for it
every night as a kid.

257
00:13:58,311 --> 00:13:59,113
What about you?

258
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:02,269
Do you think there's
intelligent life up there?

259
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:03,625
There?

260
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:07,720
Oh no, not there.
There!

261
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,824
Dick, can I talk to you for a second?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

262
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,355
Okay, let me
rephrase this.

263
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,473
Dick, can I talk
to you for a second?

264
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,149
Excuse me.

265
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,690
This had better be important.

266
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,091
I don't know if it's important or not, but,

267
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,639
you know that cornfield down by the interstate?
- Yes.

268
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,927
Well Sally took Roy there to kill
him. But sorry to interrupt.

269
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,556
Oh, damn!

270
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,648
She's willfully
disobeying my orders.

271
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:39,555
And in a cornfield?
That's such a cliché.

272
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:44,249
So, hey, the kids went down to
the cornfield to have a little fun.

273
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,008
Let say we join them.
- I don't want to go to a cornfield.

274
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:49,015
Maybe the monkey wants
to go to a cornfield.

275
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,819
What?
- Does the monkey want to go to a cornfield?

276
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,037
Don't you dare.

277
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,981
All right, all right, all right!
- Good, let's go!

278
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:58,963
Hello?

279
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,267
August?
- We had a date tonight.

280
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,064
Cornfield time.

281
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,102
Either you go with him
and live his life,

282
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:13,000
or you come with me
and live yours.

283
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,390
But he needs me.

284
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,301
Fine.

285
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:19,269
Maybe next week you can
try and get to first base

286
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,697
with your dad.

287
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:23,252
Tommy!

288
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,447
bye bye, Dick.

289
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,190
I like the way
you work.

290
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:35,267
You looked,
and saw, you took.

291
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,067
Now, can you lose
Forrest gump over there?

292
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:42,454
You're absolutely right.
I'll go talk to him.

293
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,454
I can handle this
myself.

294
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,136
Please, Sally,
let me kill him.

295
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:54,203
It'll look so good on my résumé.
- The answer is no.

296
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,148
Oh, Sally, please.

297
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,518
Please.

298
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,293
All right. You want the job, it's yours,

299
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,710
but we do it my way.

300
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,589
Hey, what's going on
over there?

301
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,298
The action's over here.

302
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,148
Coming!

303
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,804
Okay, take this rock.

304
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,949
When you hear me say the words,
"big dipper" bash him over the head.

305
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,392
Can you do that?
- Prepare to be dazzled.

306
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,485
So you couldn't shake him, huh, babe?
- No.

307
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:28,418
Uh...

308
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,937
Oh..Roy, look over there.
It's..it's the big dipper.

309
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,637
Roy?
- Oh, yes.

310
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:37,515
No, that's Orion's belt.

311
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:40,443
Excuse me.

312
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,701
Give me the rock, rockhead!
Now just stand guard.

313
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,992
Prepare..
- Shut up!

314
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,925
You sure you don't mind
seeing this movie?

315
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,166
Oh, no.
Anne Bancroft,

316
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,139
Olympia dukakis,
and holly hunter?

317
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,597
What teenage boy wouldn't
want to see this movie?

318
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:05,032
August, do you get along
with your family?

319
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,181
No. My father doesn't
give me any credit.

320
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:10,115
He still treats me
like a little kid.

321
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:13,114
He doesn't recognise how old I am on the inside.
- Me, too.

322
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:16,849
You know, we really have a lot in common.
- Yeah, yeah.

323
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,596
Hey you really want
to see this movie?

324
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:20,086
There's no one
in my house.

325
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,043
I want to see the movie.
- Me, too!

326
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:25,966
See how much
we have in common?

327
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,465
Two, please,
for, um...

328
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,030
"They came to talk".

329
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,392
You're a big girl,
aren't you?

330
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,411
You know what
really makes me hot?

331
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,203
Tell me.

332
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,203
The back
of a man's head.

333
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:52,191
Well, then feast
your eyes on this.

334
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:55,336
Oh, yeah!
- Whoa! Dick is coming.

335
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:57,577
Halt operation kilroy.

336
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,180
Dick,
what a pleasant surprise.

337
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,122
You'll know this one.
Now, is that the big dipper..

338
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,184
don't try to kiss up.
Your ass is grass.

339
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,404
I can't believe
you, Roy.

340
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:12,664
This is where that
Ufo story always ends up..

341
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,955
you and a woman
in a cornfield.

342
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,520
You make me sick.

343
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,512
I did not ask
to be beamed

344
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:21,688
on board that ship
of unspeakable horror.

345
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:25,093
Excuse me. Beamed?
You said "sucked".

346
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:28,099
No, I said "beamed."
- Who heard "sucked"?

347
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,325
Well, yeah.

348
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,216
You're lying. I'm lying.
He's lying.

349
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,171
I have had it
with you.

350
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,929
Name one thing
I did wrong tonight.

351
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,250
You lied, you
embarrassed me, you were yourself.

352
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,520
Well, if you're
going to nitpick,

353
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,202
I'm leaving.
- Thank god.

354
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,501
So, I'll see you
on mom's birthday?

355
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:54,635
Yeah. You want to go in on a present?
- Nothing over 40 bucks.

356
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:55,583
You got it.

357
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:02,958
I need a ride.

358
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,885
Oh, really?
- Sally.

359
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,888
Whatever.

360
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:11,986
Hey, wait for me.

361
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,229
What just happened here?
- What do you mean?

362
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,133
You're going to see him
at your mom's birthday?

363
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:23,485
Yeah. It's a birthday.
He's family.

364
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:27,489
So, no matter
how obnoxious you are,

365
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,071
how much of a burden
you become,

366
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,382
you can still count on the
forgiveness of your family?

367
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:33,734
Yeah.

368
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,439
Even if they touch your radio
and refuse to make smoked chub,

369
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,240
and disobey your orders
not to kill?

370
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,095
Yeah, even then.

371
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,916
That is so beautiful.

372
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,629
I'm a brother.

373
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,762
All right, Dick,
come on.

374
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:03,234
I disobeyed orders. I deserve
some punishment. What'll it be?

375
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,381
Well, Sally, ordinarily I'd
send you to some desolate moon,

376
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:07,927
and make you stand
in a crater

377
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:09,152
and think about
what you've done.

378
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,273
But I've realized,

379
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:15,792
that I've got to accept your
flaws and your inadequacies,

380
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,091
because you're
my sister now.

381
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,790
And even though
sometimes you tick me off,

382
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,412
I think I...
I love you.

383
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,041
What?
- You're my little sister,

384
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:29,707
and I love you.

385
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,665
Now, how does that
make you feel?

386
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:35,288
Well, um...

387
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,244
I want to blame you for
everything and push you off the roof.

388
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,473
Well, that's great,
because Dr. Albright

389
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,611
loves her brother
and she feels the same way.

390
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,305
Great, 'cause
that's how I feel.

391
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,225
I'm so glad we've got that settled.
- Me, too.

392
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,243
Whoa!

393
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,435
I love you, too.

394
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:59,438
I'm so happy!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,826
You notice how this James
Brown is always getting somewhere?

2
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:21,455
He's getting up,
getting down, getting back.

3
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:25,216
We should contact him.. I mean, as part of
our mission to study life on this planet.

4
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,120
Yes, but according to this,
he's more of a machine,

5
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:28,741
a sex machine.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,701
Oh, look!
It's the campus police.

7
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:36,545
Is there some kind of problem?
- Ooh, actually, yes.

8
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,497
There's a star missing
right there.

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,745
And we think
we know who did it.

10
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:45,012
This is your family?
- Why, yes.

11
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:46,682
That's exactly
what we were going for.

12
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:50,098
Sally's the woman. I'm the tall,
dashing man. Tommy is the adolescent.

13
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,642
And Harry is...
the funny looking one.

14
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:54,834
I'm gonna have to see
your driver's license, please.

15
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:57,369
Why? We're not driving.
We're parked.

16
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:59,940
Yeah, but you're parked
on university property.

17
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,410
Oh, I am university property.

18
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:04,014
Here's my photo I.D.

19
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,148
It's just my head,
but I assure you

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,054
the rest of me is
anatomically correct.

21
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:11,433
Well, Dr. Solomon,
it's 2:00 A.M.

22
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,744
So, let's pack this up and move it out.
- Right away.

23
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,979
Dick, what's
a driver's licence?

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,235
It must be some kind
of human validation.

25
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,077
We should get one if we're going to blend in.
- I'm on it.

26
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:25,869
Listen.
It's that guy again.

27
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:30,306
God, it's amazing. How does he
sing like that?

28
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:35,013
Dick, remember how I said
I wanted to learn to sing?

29
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:37,091
I've changed my mind.

30
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,204
As many intelligent people know..

31
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,933
.. aliens are all around us.

32
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,963
This is the story of four
such explorers.

33
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,168
Where are you?

34
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:42,558
Very well, I can wait.

35
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,962
You're not watching me.
I'm not watching you.

36
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,827
You're somewhere
in the room, I can feel it.

37
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,439
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
- Yah!

38
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:55,957
What is it, Nina?
- Here's the mail.

39
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,750
Oh, it's a letter
for Dr. Albright.

40
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,970
She'll hold this
in her delicate hand,

41
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,835
insert a finger and rip
through the mucilage.

42
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:05,887
She's just wonderful.

43
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,593
I knew you had
a thing for her.

44
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:10,701
Yes, but I understand I'm
not allowed to show it to her

45
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:11,871
without her permission.

46
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,756
Good morning,
Dr. Albright.

47
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:17,690
Good morning, Dr. Albright.
- Good morning.

48
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,173
Dr. Solomon, I was just thinking of you.
- You were?

49
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,925
Yes. I have a meeting with the
rules committee on Friday night,

50
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,238
and I just can't make it.

51
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,019
It's too late
to try and get out of it now,

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,245
unless you can talk
some idiot into replac..

53
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,445
oh.

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,915
You look wonderful. Is that a new jacket?
- I'm entirely new.

55
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,680
Everyone on the rules committee
wants to meet you. - Really?

56
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,008
Oh we all think of you as the resident genius.

57
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,653
oh please, I need you
to substitute for me.

58
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,591
You need me?
I never dreamed

59
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,131
that I would be
the man you needed.

60
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,945
I need you desperately.

61
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,296
Let me know if it's going
to get any deeper.

62
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:56,925
I'm wearing
open-Toed shoes.

63
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,505
I'm not prepared.
- It's a dull, mindless group.

64
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,883
It's "the night
of the teaching dead."

65
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,945
Maybe I can shake things up
with some fresh ideas.

66
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,375
No one there would recognize a
fresh idea if it bit them on the ass.

67
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,257
Just pass these out
for me, please.

68
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,662
All right,
I'll do it.

69
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,112
Oh, thanks.
You've saved me.

70
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,841
Well, I am a manly man.

71
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,915
Well done.
- Another five minutes,

72
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,361
and he would have
given me a kidney.

73
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:32,755
Next!

74
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't believe how much we have
to go through to get a licence.

75
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,725
Yeah. Then why
are we here?

76
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,750
Because I want one.
If I have to be the woman,

77
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,141
I'm not about to be stuck at home.
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,810
"Stay behind orange line".

79
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,140
That's why nobody
ever gets to the window.

80
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,071
Hey, let's pull up
the slack here.

81
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,985
Oh! There must be some sort of

82
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:59,547
flesh-melting force field
at the orange line.

83
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,559
Next!
- No-Ooo!

84
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,092
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,381
You know, cars must have some
huge power we haven't discovered yet.

86
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,686
Look at this.. the lines,
the waiting, the testing.

87
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:16,298
Can you imagine what you must
have to go through to get a gun?

88
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,149
Next!

89
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,695
What is it they don't get?
That woman says "next".

90
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:28,315
The first person
goes to the window.

91
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,938
The second person moves to
the orange line, becoming first.

92
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,764
The third person becomes second,
and the rest of us pull up the slack!

93
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,547
There are just too many
gaps in this line.

94
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,857
We should each only be a
single person-thickness apart.

95
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:40,756
Good point.

96
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:43,832
I think everyone
should hear it.

97
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,280
You think so?

98
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,493
Okay, people, listen up
and nobody gets hurt!

99
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,846
Tommy, have you been sitting
in that same chair all day?

100
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,206
Hmm, let me think
about this one...Yeah!

101
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:07,214
You're supposed to be
experiencing human adolescent behavior.

102
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:10,223
Well, as an adolescent,
everything annoys me,

103
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,940
especially the sound
of your voice right now.

104
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,324
Nothing. - yes you did.

105
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,729
I did not.
- Don't try to blame it on me.

106
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,736
Did you get your license?
- We were thrown out.

107
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:21,025
On the bright side,
we did outrun the police.

108
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,127
What went wrong?

109
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:26,493
Everything. What do people have to do
on this planet to get what they want?

110
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:29,553
Today Dr. Albright wanted
something from me. All she did was ask.

111
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,908
What did she say?
- She said she needed my help

112
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,375
and I looked wonderful
and I'm a genius.

113
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:37,103
She said that?
- About you?

114
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,412
Yes.
- And you bought it?

115
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,762
Well, I am the high commander.

116
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,760
Wait a minute, something about
this doesn't wash.

117
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,992
She's doing something.

118
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,193
Now I remember,
I read about this.

119
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,135
She's distorting
the truth.

120
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,496
Dr. Albright would
never lie to me.

121
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,627
Ohh wake up and snort
the coffee.

122
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,045
Just because you don't lie
doesn't mean people here don't.

123
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,621
We're colleagues.
I trust her.

124
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,147
I command you
to be more like her.

125
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,575
Like what?
- Like a woman.

126
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,116
Fine. I can woman.
- Good.

127
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,412
Commander, permission to speak freely?
- Granted.

128
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:15,102
As the oldest member of
this crew, I feel it's my duty

129
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,969
to inform you all that
this planet both

130
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,005
wipes and sucks...
in that order.

131
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,332
What is your problem?

132
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,774
Something's wrong.
My transfer's not holding.

133
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,541
I'm growing hair,
and my armpits smell,

134
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,767
and there's a constant
circus in my pants.

135
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:35,064
Aw, our old man
is becoming a boy.

136
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,331
No, no I'm serious.
The seal's broken,

137
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,909
and I'm losing oil.
Look at this.

138
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,485
ooh! What is it?

139
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,348
It's a nipple.

140
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,820
What am I going to do about it?
- I don't know,

141
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:48,944
but until we figure it out, maybe
you should sleep in the shower.

142
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,573
Gentlemen, we have a guest
member of the rules

143
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:00,199
committee
with us tonight.

144
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,042
Dr. Solomon, would you
care to share with us

145
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:05,203
some of Dr. Albright's feelings?
- Oh, yes, of course.

146
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,349
Well, first, on behalf
of Dr. Albright,

147
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,099
I would like to say welcome
to this big waste of time.

148
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,228
I'd say I've always wanted
to put a face with those men

149
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,686
whom she
affectionately calls

150
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,478
"the night of
the teaching dead".

151
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,344
And may I say you
do not disappoint.

152
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:24,315
I can tell at a glance that you
indeed are a mindless and dull group.

153
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,931
So, I would like to start
with a fresh idea

154
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:29,339
that you won't recognise
when it bites you on the ass.

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,289
Excuse me, does Dr. Albright
know you're speaking on her behalf?

156
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,050
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

157
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,030
Dr. Solomon..
- Freeze! He's still there!

158
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:45,176
Oh! You have
a mole.

159
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,227
A big, ugly mole.

160
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,914
Well, you're in early.

161
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:56,099
Dr. Byron told me about
your little speech.

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,171
Sorry I missed it.

163
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,011
Rest assured,
I gave you full credit.

164
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:05,139
What the hell are you trying to do?
Ruin me?

165
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:11,479
It will take me weeks to
repair the damage left in your wake.

166
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:14,273
Weeks.

167
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:17,331
All you had to do was
show up and feign interest.

168
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,468
Feign? I will not be
a party to feigning.

169
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:20,975
I always tell
the complete truth.

170
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,264
The truth? Then I will be brutally Frank.

171
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,685
Good, I'll be
genuine Dick.

172
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,739
I thought, foolishly,

173
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,818
this would be a good opportunity
for my colleagues to get to know you.

174
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:38,278
No one wanted to meet you.
I made that up.

175
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,194
So you lied?

176
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,922
I was bending the truth to
flatter you. There's a difference.

177
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:47,286
Oh I see. So when we met, you
said you were pleased to meet me.

178
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,304
Was that a lie or "truth-bending"?
- "Figure of speech".

179
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,663
And when you said you were impressed
with my résumé? - "Light conversation".

180
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,965
When I moved in, you said you
didn't mind sharing your office?

181
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,922
"Diplomacy".
Anything else?

182
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:01,052
Yes, is that really the color of your hair?
- Absolutely!

183
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,446
You're upset,
aren't you?

184
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,763
Tell the truth.
- Yes.

185
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,939
I thought I could
trust you. I can't.

186
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,682
Trust me? You're the one
who lied and tricked me.

187
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:16,921
No. It's not how you
lie to trick someone.

188
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,644
First, you start by.. you
have something on your tie.

189
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,739
Ah-ha, very clever.

190
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:28,911
Yes, I see how that works. You
have something on your shoulder.

191
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:38,693
That's not how it works.
This is how it works.

192
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:41,129
Your shirt tail's on fire.
That's how.

193
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,405
Your blouse
is on fire.

194
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:43,979
Stop.. get
your hands off me!

195
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,092
Don't move!

196
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,300
Whyyy!

197
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,990
That was my fly.

198
00:10:58,822 --> 00:10:59,989
I know.

199
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:08,702
On the subject
of universal truth,

200
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,127
Albert Einstein
once said..

201
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,021
any thoughts on that?

202
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,449
Anyone? Yes, Caryn.

203
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,550
Dr. Solomon, I think
you were speaking German.

204
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,695
Er yes, German.
Einstein spoke German.

205
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,794
Okay, I'll simplify.

206
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,504
"Scientific proof is nothing
more than conditional truth".

207
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:40,337
We all understand
what truth is, don't we?

208
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:44,135
Now, I have three of
Einstein's equations on the board.

209
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,692
Two of them are false,
and one is true.

210
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:47,346
Who can spot the true one? Anyone?

211
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,836
How many of you think
it's number one?

212
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,700
I'll give you a hint:
it's not number one.

213
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,023
Here's another hint:
it's not number two.

214
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,451
How many of you think
it's number three?

215
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,363
Well, you're wrong.
I lied. I made them all up!

216
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:05,353
You see, lying
accomplishes nothing.

217
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:07,167
You can't trust
someone who lies.

218
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:09,833
You work with them. You think you
know them. They ask you to substitute.

219
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,362
You make a fool of yourself. They get mad.

220
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,537
And your sister can't even
get a driver's licence.

221
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,138
Dr. Solomon, is this
going to be on the final?

222
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:21,153
The point I'm making is,

223
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,538
you have to tell
the absolute truth,

224
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,848
or else you just end up
confusing people.

225
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:29,091
But, Dr. Solomon, sometimes
you just can't tell the truth.

226
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,406
But why not?
Anyone?

227
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,902
Leon, I'm going to
ask you a question,

228
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,096
and I want you to tell me
the complete truth.

229
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:37,667
This won't affect
my grade?

230
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,580
Absolutely not.
What do you think of me?

231
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,379
Uh... you make me
really nervous.

232
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,343
I don't know what's
going on half the time,

233
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,069
and when you walk around
the room, I'm always afraid

234
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,559
you're going to hit me
in the back of the head.

235
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,963
Thank you.
There, you see...the truth.

236
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:02,948
By the way, Leon,
you're failing.

237
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:07,060
I thought you said it wouldn't affect my grade.
It didn't.

238
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,708
Anybody home?
Anyb-- Oh, hi.

239
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,668
I brought you folks
your extra key.

240
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah, right.
Good excuse.

241
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,357
You just wanted to come up
here and stare at pimple boy.

242
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:27,299
You poor kid. I remember
how it feels to be your age.

243
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,569
Yeah, I remember how it feels
to be your age.

244
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,148
Listen, I'm going to go out and get some
smokes. You want to take a ride?

245
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,445
Yeah, whatever.

246
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:40,175
It's really not fair. I can
grow a pimple but not a mustache.

247
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:41,856
What's your secret?

248
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,499
Solomon, Sally.
- Here.

249
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,528
You failed the written exam.
Come back in three weeks.

250
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,153
I can't come back.
I can't.

251
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,574
Sorry, those are the rules.
- I need a licence now.

252
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:01,910
I'm the woman.

253
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,396
I really need your help.

254
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,326
You must be a genius.

255
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:21,991
Your line is so big,
but it moves so fast.

256
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,068
Well, I do my best.

257
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,852
There's got to be
some way you can help me.

258
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:30,424
I mean, I know you have
a heart in that..

259
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:33,659
big,hairy,
wonderful chest of yours.

260
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,662
I bet pretty girls
beg you all the time, huh?

261
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,125
Okay, you can take
the test again.

262
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,318
Thank you.

263
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,978
I could get
very good at this.

264
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,227
Hey, what did you put
under "weight"?

265
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,834
Tommy, are you all right?
Where have you been?

266
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,939
The mall, Dick.
I was at the mall.

267
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,606
It may be the most
emotionally satisfying place

268
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,868
I've ever been.

269
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,642
Were you able to observe
other life-forms?

270
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,278
Definitely.
Everybody there

271
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,543
was as oily
and disgusting as me.

272
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,257
It was a food court
of mutants,

273
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:21,156
a catalog of horrors,
a freak show,

274
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,516
and I was
their lizard king.

275
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,172
Oh. What do you do
when you're there?

276
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,654
Hang.
- What do you see?

277
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,241
Stuff.

278
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:34,347
I belong now.

279
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,328
Oh, yeah, stay out
of my room!

280
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,706
Dick? Dick, look,

281
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,292
I got my driver's licence.

282
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:49,427
According to this, you're a
55-year-old, 300-pound Asian woman.

283
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,140
And an organ donor.

284
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,732
Dick, I got
my driver's permit, too.

285
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,740
Yes, I expected you would.

286
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:04,551
I just want to say that I
not only accomplished my goal,

287
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:06,464
but... I've discovered

288
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,917
a softer place
within myself,

289
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:12,381
and it is all because of you and
your extraordinary ability to command.

290
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,417
Thank you, lieutenant.
- You have so many facets to admire,

291
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,517
time prohibits
my naming them all.

292
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,283
Shall I speak
of your courage,

293
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,276
how you've led a ragtag crew
of misfits across the galaxies,

294
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,095
fueled by
your brave spirit?

295
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,709
Or shall I confess
that your boyish good looks

296
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,245
are stunted only
by your personal bigness?

297
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:41,371
Oh, where to begin simply exhausts
my feminine mind.

298
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,823
What are you doing?
- Lying.

299
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:49,666
You like it?
- It's incredible.

300
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,360
I love it!
- Really?

301
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,563
Yes! How did you do it?
- Anybody can do it.

302
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:57,910
Look at me, I've just done it once,
and here I am, whipping it out there.

303
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,957
I thought the truth
was potent,

304
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,817
but it's nothing
compared to this.

305
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:05,491
This makes me feel
powerless and susceptible,

306
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,105
and ready to yield
to your every..

307
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,225
I've got to find
Dr. Albright.

308
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,157
This is Wednesday. She
calls it "over the hump day".

309
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,068
I don't know what that means
, but I know where she humps.

310
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,345
Tommy, we're going out.

311
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:22,483
I'll drive.
- No, I'll drive.

312
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:22,939
Dick...

313
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,908
Harry called it.

314
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,486
Shotgun.
- I don't want to ride in the back.

315
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,836
Dr. Albright, hello.

316
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,766
Hello. Sorry we don't
have a chair for you.

317
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,708
Not a problem.

318
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:39,838
You know Dr. Byron.
- Yes, of course.

319
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,274
You really should have that thing
removed. It's all I can look at.

320
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,464
Excuse me.
- I--

321
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,072
looks like there's
just the two of us.

322
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,201
I'll have a pitcher
of that stuff.

323
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,528
May I see your driver's license?
- You bet you can.

324
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,762
Okay, Mrs. Wu.

325
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,485
I discovered something today,
and I really need to try it out.

326
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,418
Thorazine.
I'll get you some water.

327
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,756
You see, you know
these things.

328
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,428
You're so smart,
and your...

329
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,366
your looks..
your looks are like...

330
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,075
a beer tap,

331
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:19,795
a golden rush of drunken
beauty with a nice head

332
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:23,032
which spills
all down your blouse,

333
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,905
leaving you sweet
and pungent.

334
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,132
That was pathetic.

335
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,376
Well, I'm sorry I'm not
as good a liar as you are.

336
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,176
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving.

337
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:38,277
Wait! You're not
finished with me yet!

338
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:39,919
Do you mind?
We're talking.

339
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,842
Okay, you win.

340
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,780
What is it?
- I've realized something.

341
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:49,599
I can't lie to you.
I wish I could.

342
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,914
It's just not something that
I'm good at, like.. like...

343
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,246
actually, I'm good
at everything.

344
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:57,339
 Can I tell you the truth?
- Why not?

345
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,688
The real truth is,

346
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,700
you're delightful.

347
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,292
I love looking
into your face.

348
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,903
I don't know what it is
about you this evening,

349
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:09,919
maybe it's the way the light
hits your eyes, maybe it's the wine,

350
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,674
but you look puffy.. you
should go home and sleep.

351
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,170
There.
Is that better?

352
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:22,000
Sadly, yes.

353
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,340
May I walk you home?
And be honest.

354
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,306
Okay.

355
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,038
You know, if someone
had told me a year ago

356
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,869
that I'd be
driving a car

357
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,657
and sucking the flesh
off a dead bird,

358
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,113
I'd have
called 'em a liar.

359
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,474
Being human is far more
complex than I thought.

360
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:53,442
There is no absolute
personal truth here,

361
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,314
and these bodies don't come
with an owner's manual.

362
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:59,573
So every day these people
have to make up life,

363
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,714
and truth becomes
highly individual.

364
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,220
Oh, my god, Dick,

365
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,848
what if this lying thing falls
into the hands of the politicians?

366
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,902
Ooh, that's
a horrifying thought.

367
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,546
I think these humans
bend the truth

368
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,138
because this is
a difficult place to live.

369
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:20,292
It's a lonely blue dot

370
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,925
on the far end
of the galaxy.

371
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,298
And all the half-truths
and flattery and diplomacy

372
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,124
are the lubricant that
people spread on each other

373
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,432
to get over
the rough spots.

374
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:33,224
It's a lot easier on our
planet. No one ever lies.

375
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,522
Except, of course, when you
don't want to help somebody move.

376
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,780
I was sick that day.
- I helped you move.

377
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,708
I had two boxes.

378
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,952
Who packed the boxes?
okay, listen, if we're gonna...

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

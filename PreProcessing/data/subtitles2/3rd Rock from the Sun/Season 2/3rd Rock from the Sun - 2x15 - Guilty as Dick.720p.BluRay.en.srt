1
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:04,925
Oh, hi, Nina.

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:07,388
Would you stand up on the
desk and adjust that vent?

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:09,029
It's blowing
right in my face.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,177
Uh, yeah. I'll get
to that real soon.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,198
Until then,
you just do it yourself.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,542
Fair enough.

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,095
Oh hi, Dick. Would you adjust my vent?

8
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,138
With Nina
in the room?

9
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,064
Get up on the desk
and adjust my vent.

10
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:34,337
Oh, of course. Nina, please leave the room.
- No problem.

11
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,745
I can't reach it
from here.

12
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,329
Put your foot on the chair.

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,551
Are you sure?
It's.. it's wobbly.

14
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,340
Well, I'll hold it down.
- Well, all right.

15
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:49,500
A little further.
- Okay.

16
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:53,942
Ah, there, how's that?
- Hold on, I'll check.

17
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,064
My foot!
My foot!

18
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,310
Oh, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

19
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,566
It should have been you!
It should have been you!

20
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,989
That should do it,
Dr. Solomon.

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,885
Well, that's unbelievable.
I feel no pain.

22
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:45,676
Well you may feel some
discomfort when the shock wears off.

23
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:50,074
No. Obviously, the fall has
made me impervious to pain.

24
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:54,589
You should go home and try to stay
off your foot as much as possible.

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,522
Keep it elevated,
keep ice on it.

26
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,186
Just use good judgment.

27
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,784
I have
excellent judgment.

28
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:00,407
Yep.

29
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,119
In fact, Nina,
hand me the staple gun.

30
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:07,884
Call me if you need me.

31
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,819
Oh, thank you, doctor.
I'Il take him home right now.

32
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:14,975
I can drive myself.
- Oh! Don't be silly! It's the least I can do.

33
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,285
I'll take you home, come
back here, pick up my car,

34
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,726
go to the drug store, the grocery
store, pick up anything you need.

35
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:23,329
Okay.
- I'll just bring the car around, okay?

36
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,792
Wha.. why is she
doing this?

37
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,873
Sit back and relax.
You're in pain,

38
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:30,589
she knows she caused it,
she feels guilty.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,768
Wha.. why should she
be guilty? I'm not in pain.

40
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,901
I have a superhuman
threshold for pain.

41
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,638
And wha-lah!

42
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,351
Harry?

43
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:54,857
I'm in my room!

44
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:03,064
This isn't a room. This is a
shower curtain in a hall way.

45
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,627
Is that so? Then why
are my linens here?

46
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,139
Because your linens fell off
the washing machine.

47
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,046
I'm sick of sleeping
on the washing machine.

48
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:16,630
Oh, sure, a vibrating
bed impresses the ladies...

49
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:20,888
but I want my own room! Dick
said that I could have one.

50
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,380
No. Dick said that under no
circumstances could you have your own room.

51
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,641
Let's not quibble
over semantics.

52
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,303
Besides, you guys
have your own rooms.

53
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,679
I sleep in a storage space
behind Dick's chimney.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,302
And my room is an uninsulated
alcove overlooking a toilet.

55
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,570
Room with a view...
rub it in.

56
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,468
Harry, you can't
sleep in the hallway!

57
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,320
Home wrecker!

58
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,748
What's wrong?!

59
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,071
She hurt me!
- It was an accident!

60
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,210
Oh an accident?

61
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,924
We can make accidents
happen too, lady.

62
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,638
Here, let me
elevate that foot.

63
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,671
No touching!
No touching!

64
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:06,764
Ooh, what did my body
ever do to deserve this?

65
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:09,982
What did I ever do to you?!
Mary, turn it off!

66
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,857
Well I can't. The doctor said he
doesn't give drugs for a sprain.

67
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,667
But that's good news,
isn't it? It's not broken.

68
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,337
Well I heard sometimes a sprain
can be worse than a break.

69
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,247
Oh, is that one worse?!
- Yes, it is! Much worse!

70
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:23,999
Well, I said
I was sorry!

71
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:25,618
Can I fix you
something to eat?

72
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,140
Just fix my foot! I don't care
if I starve, just fix my foot!

73
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,261
I.. I'll get you
some ice.

74
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,917
Look at my foot.

75
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,507
It's one big boo-boo.

76
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,182
Dick, you sound pretty pathetic.

77
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:40,079
Is it pathetic
to sprain your foot,

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,251
worse than anybody ever in the
history of the world. Sally!

79
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,022
Sorry, Dick. But you know
nothing about earth pain

80
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,933
until you've been
a woman, okay?

81
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:51,626
One week every month, I feel like
I got a pair of pliers in my pants.

82
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:55,078
You got a boo-boo? I'm in
the national guard of pain.

83
00:04:56,828 --> 00:05:00,415
What was I thinking? I am
so stupid! I am so stupid!

84
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,584
Mary seems to understand
my pain.

85
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,924
Dick?
I too understand your pain.

86
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:07,748
It's right here.

87
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,780
Ah, crespin,
two boxes?

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,565
Rupsin, johnny,
one box.

89
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,402
Solomon?

90
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:24,388
Fifteen?

91
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:28,260
You really think you can sell
fifteen boxes of chocolate?

92
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,432
Sell?

93
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:31,857
That's right.

94
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:34,729
After school, on the weekends..
until every bar of chocolate is sold.

95
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,594
No one's gonna wanna
buy this crap!

96
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,070
It doesn't even have raisins!

97
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,048
I'll give you raisins.
- Or Nougat!

98
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,841
I'm gonna nougat you, Solomon!

99
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,825
What do I get
for selling this crap?

100
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,017
You get the satisfaction
of helping to pay to

101
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,182
send the band
to Washington!

102
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:50,815
Now how's that for compensation?!
- Oh, all right, cool.

103
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,614
That's that.

104
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm Gonna practise some ball passing.

105
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:56,877
I want half of you
over there,

106
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:57,765
half of you over there,

107
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,977
the other half
come with me.

108
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,928
I brought you some soup.

109
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:16,019
Let me just fix
this foot here.

110
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,389
Eat your soup.
- Okay.

111
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,890
Mmm, this tastes
sumptuous.

112
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:30,046
My mother used to make this soup
for me whenever I ..

113
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,776
Did she always serve it
this cold?

114
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,353
I'll heat it up some more.
- Thank you, Mary.

115
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:37,847
Thank you.

116
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,304
Is something wrong?
- Oh...

117
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,278
no, but, could you also
get me some crackers?

118
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,326
Sure.

119
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,150
Are you okay?
- Oyster crackers?

120
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,891
Mary,
I just wanted to say,

121
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:19,130
I'm so happy that it was
you who hurt me so horribly.

122
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:24,430
All right. I'll be right back
with your soup and crackers.

123
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,350
Oyster crackers!

124
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:30,826
My god!

125
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,005
I have a magic foot!

126
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:40,020
Sally, what are you doing?
- Eating your soup.

127
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,908
Well, you can't do that!
- It's not that terrible.

128
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,426
You put a bunch of oyster
crackers in it, you can barely taste it.

129
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,916
Don't eat all of these!
Dick is lying in there hurt.

130
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,980
Well I'm fine and I'm hungry. Besides,
I'm not the one who broke his foot.

131
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,492
Sprained.

132
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,760
Have a little compassion,
Sally.

133
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:57,708
We're healthy.
We have to help him.

134
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,413
I say he's lame.
Shoot him.

135
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,865
And wha-lah!

136
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,791
Harry, what are you
doing in here?

137
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,070
Dancing to the natural
sounds of plumbing.

138
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,598
Okay, well, get out 'cause
I've got to use the bathroom.

139
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,313
You can't kick me
out of my own room!

140
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,146
Okay, pilgrim.
It's your funeral.

141
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:24,334
Oh, dear god!
No, no, no, no, no!

142
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,646
Hi, my name's
Tommy Solomon.

143
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:36,298
I'm selling chocolate bars to send
the high school band to Washington.

144
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:43,358
Hey, fat guy! Is this a dream or what?!

145
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,946
Candy door to door..

146
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,353
Hi, father.

147
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,207
I'm trying to sell
these chocolate bars,

148
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,447
so the high school band
can go to Washington.

149
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,773
And learn
about Christianity.

150
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,648
And... become priests.

151
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,315
Fine then.
They'll stay here in Rutherford

152
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,180
and worship Satan!

153
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,040
Now this is
what I call a room.

154
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,554
I've got everything
a man could need.

155
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:14,165
A piece of plywood, the gnome,
a very thin blanket,

156
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,140
no food,
and my new friend, the crow.

157
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,140
Hi neighbour!

158
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,502
Not exactly the house
warming gift I hoped for.

159
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,099
But you can't
pick your neighbours.

160
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,845
Tommy,
make me a sandwich.

161
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,455
You have a sandwich
right there.

162
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,541
I know, but Mary cut it
in half, and not diagonally,

163
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,422
and that hurts my foot.

164
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:52,958
Well, you can chalk it up to me
being a teenager, but I just don't care.

165
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,947
Mary won't be back from the
colouring book store for half an hour.

166
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,320
You know, this day
has been hell!

167
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:01,324
I think I met
one nice guy all day.

168
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,948
Well, how many bars did he buy?

169
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,149
Oh, none. But he sold me
this nice set of encyclopedias.

170
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,848
Tommy?

171
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:12,227
Tommy, it's an emergency!
I need the remote!

172
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:16,546
Sally.
Sally.

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,293
God, what?
- I can't reach the remote.

174
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:24,271
It's right there!
- But I can't get to it, Sally.

175
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,235
So?!
- Oh, lieutenant

176
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,308
Do you know what it's like
to feel helpless?

177
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,222
To be robbed
of your freedom by an injury?

178
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:31,416
To be a burden
on your family?

179
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,485
Oh, god,
how you must hate me!

180
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,846
I'm.. experiencing
the strangest sensation.

181
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,831
I feel bad
that you feel bad and..

182
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,008
even though I know
it'll be annoying,

183
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,653
I just can't seem to fight it.
Dick, can I get you anything?!

184
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:50,941
Make me a sandwich
and cut it diagonally.

185
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,206
Okay.

186
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,733
Oh, you forgot
the remote!

187
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,951
My foot!
It's better!

188
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,845
No!

189
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,338
Go on, doctor.
Give it to me straight.

190
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,207
The ankle looks great.

191
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,205
Are you sure?
- Yes, you're all better.

192
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,470
Don't you think you should
break it and set it again

193
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,368
just to make sure
it heals properly?

194
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:35,560
No.

195
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,273
Doctor, you don't understand.

196
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,172
The moment I sprained
that foot,

197
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:42,052
my life went
from VCR to VCR plus!

198
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,988
You've got to help me!

199
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:47,184
Dick?
The ankle is healed.

200
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,521
I won't be treated this way
by your heartless H.M.O.

201
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,224
I demand control
of my treatment options!

202
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:58,497
Because it's not the length of our time here
that matters, it's the quality of our lives!

203
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,449
And if you're not qualified
to break my foot,

204
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,429
then by god, I'll find
a doctor who will!

205
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,402
So you're telling me that in
this colourful, monochrome wrapper

206
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,410
is a bar of chocolate?
- That's right.

207
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,195
Delicious chocolate.

208
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,938
Now, how far would you walk
for a bar of chocolate?

209
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,546
To get a bar of chocolate, or at
the request of a bar of chocolate?

210
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:25,536
To get.
- Oh, 53 miles.

211
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,671
Well, now you can have
chocolate in your own home.

212
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:31,199
In my own home?!

213
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,480
That's right. Now, how much
would you pay for that?

214
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,869
For my own home,
or for a bar of chocolate?

215
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,992
Bar of chocolate.
- Ah..

216
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,089
Well, we tried.

217
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,652
Owww!

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,387
Excuse me,
my friend hurt his leg.

219
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:51,424
Could you help us out
and buy a chocolate bar?

220
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:57,801
Oh, Nina...

221
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,296
I can't tell you
how good it is

222
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:01,999
to be among people
who brush their own teeth.

223
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,830
You're not
brushing his teeth?

224
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:09,746
Do I have any messages?

225
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,756
One o'clock, Dr. Solomon called. He
wants to know where you are.

226
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:16,884
Oh, god.
- 1.05, Dr. Solomon called again.

227
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:19,748
His foot feels hot. Doesn't know if
that's a good thing or a bad thing.

228
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:24,893
1.12, Dr. Solomon called. He's hungry.
Can you make him a personal pan pizza?

229
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,155
1.17. Dr. Solomon called.

230
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:30,856
Wants to know if you've forgotten
that you were the one that hurt his foot.

231
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,256
Hello?

232
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,256
No, you have
the wrong number.

233
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,191
Oh, your foot hurts?

234
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:53,336
Have you tried
hitting it with a hammer?

235
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,220
I've cold called, I've direct mailed.

236
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,766
I can't afford a pay-per-view
special.  Nothing works.

237
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,101
This isn't my problem, buddy.

238
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:10,964
Well, just help out an incredibly
screwed kid and buy a chocolate bar.

239
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:14,113
If I bought every stupid
thing that came to my door..

240
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,628
Tommy, forget it.
The guy's not buying anything.

241
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,425
..I'd be living up to my pledge to
help every kid who came to my door.

242
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:26,247
Cash or check?
- How 'bout both?

243
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,372
Oh, come on!
That is just so cheap!

244
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,380
God!

245
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,566
I really want some candy!

246
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:52,448
What is that?
- 93.9, the wave.

247
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,135
The best of the '70s,
'80s and today.

248
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:57,957
Well, I know what it is,
but where is it coming from?

249
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,057
From my new tree
entertainment system!

250
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,062
Oh, look!

251
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:06,347
The squirrels are getting it on
to Marvin Gaye.

252
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:11,001
So it's nice up there?
- Only the best room in the house.

253
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:13,419
See you later, Dick.
- But.. but..

254
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,554
wha.. wha..
oh, Sally?

255
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,584
Thank god you're here.

256
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:21,730
You know how I hate
asking for your help,

257
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:23,988
but could you just please

258
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,134
do me this one little favour?
- What?

259
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,427
I want to see Harry's
cool tree house. Carry me?

260
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:31,580
No way.

261
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,446
Oh, please, Sally?

262
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:36,045
There's so little joy in my life.
- No.

263
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:38,462
But Sally, I ask you
for so little!

264
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:40,190
Can you just once..
- No!

265
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,194
You're right.

266
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,704
What good is a tree house visit
when death is only moments away?

267
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,528
What?
- Tonight's meal may be my last.

268
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,853
And you know
what that means?

269
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,807
Mexican night!

270
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,003
I think I hate you, Dick.

271
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,692
Tommy, Harry! We gotta go back to the store!

272
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,954
It's Mexican night!
- Oh great!

273
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,855
You know what is so weird,
Dick?

274
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,947
I don't know if it's, uh,
what you're saying or...

275
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:16,137
how you're saying it,
but, um...

276
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,497
all that stuff that used
to make me want to help you,

277
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:20,647
well, now it's just
pissing me off!

278
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:24,021
Oh, and Sally?
- What?!

279
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,768
Corn tortillas,
not flour.

280
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,005
Si, Señor.

281
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,731
No way!

282
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,544
You guys!
You gotta see this!

283
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,507
Ohh, I should have known.

284
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:53,771
What are you looking at?

285
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,325
That bastard!

286
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:03,354
There goes Mexican night.
- Oh, it's Mexican night all right.

287
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,312
Mexican prison night.

288
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:06,994
I say we stick a bucket
on his head,

289
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,081
and whack him with a bat like a piñata
and we don't stop till candy comes out!

290
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:12,574
Tommy, Harry, let's go!
- Wait a minute, Sally!

291
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:16,047
What about me? He's taken
advantage of me worse than any of you.

292
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,335
He made me cut up his food
and feed it to him.

293
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,834
He made me sing to his foot!

294
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,420
He made me take
his temperature...

295
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,565
the hard way.

296
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,329
Besides, I don't think you
have what it takes to get even.

297
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,225
I have a metal bucket
and three softball bats.

298
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,433
That's a pretty good start.

299
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:03,370
Ooh, oh. Hi.

300
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:06,835
The, uh.. the ladder
appears to be disconnected.

301
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,532
Funny how that happened, eh?

302
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,613
That must be painful
up there on that ladder

303
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:16,072
with that terrible,
terrible sprain.

304
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:18,997
Ah, yeah...It.. it hurts a lot.

305
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,787
Hey, Dick, how did you
get up there?

306
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,321
Well, uh...
you know how it is.

307
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,322
No, tell us.
- Could one of you just, uh...

308
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,940
grab the end of the ladder
and pull it in?

309
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,289
Gee, I don't know.
It's awfully far. My arms hurt

310
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,648
Well...

311
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,909
why don't you let me down
and I'll have a look at them?

312
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,437
Admit it, Dick!
You're a liar!

313
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:43,532
you manipulated us!
You tortured us!

314
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,902
It just happened!
It's nobody's fault!

315
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:47,494
Okay, okay, okay!

316
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,491
It's my fault.
You fortitude just felt so good.

317
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,336
So appropriate.

318
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:56,145
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:57,655
That's better.

320
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,466
Wow, now that's
gotta hurt.

321
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,631
Not as much as that.

322
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,086
All right!

323
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,781
Everybody line up
into a circle.

324
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,142
Solomon!
- Sorry I'm late, coach.

325
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:25,250
Hey, anybody who can sell 15 boxes of
chocolate in my class can be a little tardy.

326
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,700
What's your secret,
champ?

327
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:29,148
Well,
you know I...

328
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:31,360
kept thinking about
sending the band to Washington.

329
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:35,098
Well, they're gonna owe you some real
thanks when they get back next week.

330
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,976
Well..they're coming back?

331
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:40,860
Well, yeah.

332
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,354
All right,
which one of you tools

333
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:45,917
sold enough chocolate
to buy them a return ticket?!

334
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,993
Eh? Hey, you look at me when
I'm talking to you! Come here!

335
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,865
Guilt is like a belly button
that doesn't even collect lint.

336
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,491
It's a wasted emotion that just
nags and nags and nags and nags..

337
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,083
until Dick falls
out of the tree.

338
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,549
Maybe guilt is some kind of
ancient guidance system.

339
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,414
A stealth emotion
designed to make people

340
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,394
help each other out
even if they don't want to.

341
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:21,776
If I could just break that code,
I could get you all to serve me.

342
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,503
You don't need guilt
to get anyone to serve you.

343
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:26,152
We proved that
when we were selling candy.

344
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,939
All you need to do
is remind people they like sex.

345
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,079
Oh. Wouldn't it be scary if
sex and guilt were connected?

346
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,618
Sex and guilt
connected!

347
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,481
Harry, you're an idiot!
- I know.

348
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:52,647
Dick, I've been watching TV and I
think you can walk without these crutches.

349
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:53,776
No, I can't.

350
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,934
This man says
that he cannot walk,

351
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,456
but I say
that he can.

352
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,379
I say I feel the spirit
in Dick Solomon.

353
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,195
Now stand up and walk.
- But my foot is broken.

354
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,143
Oh, foot's broken.
Those are just words!

355
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,193
Now deep inside
and walk, my brother!

356
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,014
Walk!
- Aah!

357
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,588
Stay in bed, my brother.
Stay in bed.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

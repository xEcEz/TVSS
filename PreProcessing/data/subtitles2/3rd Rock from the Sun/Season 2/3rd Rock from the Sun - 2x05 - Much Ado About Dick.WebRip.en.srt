1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:02,790
Oh Dick
- Oh Mary

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,295
We mustn't do this here.
- Yes, we must do it.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,181
We can't!
- We can. I measured.

4
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:10,780
Oh! I have an early class tomorrow.

5
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,107
You hear what
she said, Dick?

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,223
She's got an early
class tomorrow.

7
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:16,784
Will you be quiet?

8
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:19,286
Can't you see I'm trying
to get to second base here?

9
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,180
Things have really changed
since she entered the picture.

10
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:25,451
Yeah, now we even have to act like
humans when we're by ourselves.

11
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:27,752
She's like
that Yoko woman

12
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:29,193
who ruined
her husband's band.

13
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:31,806
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,174
Hey you remember that episode
where she convinced Ricky

15
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,090
that she could play
the bongos?

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,201
This bites.

17
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:44,924
So does she.

18
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:25,579
What?

19
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,152
The crust in your eyes,
it's still there.

20
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:36,076
Oh, no! no, don't touch it.
It's beautiful.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,686
My god, you're
a morning person.

22
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:39,569
No.

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,540
No, I'm
a Mary person.

24
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,630
Oh! Oh, that's
so sweet.

25
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,218
I had the strangest dream
that your brother Harry

26
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,875
was curled up at our feet
in the middle of the night.

27
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:55,891
It won't happen again.

28
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,195
I'll finish dressing.
- Can I help you?

29
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:00,965
No.

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,784
Do you mind?
I am trying to sleep.

31
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,616
She slept over again?
- Slept? No.

32
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:17,333
Well, eventually,
but I think the innuendo

33
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,893
is delightfully clear.

34
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:22,296
Don't you see what's going on
here? She hogs the bathroom.

35
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,561
She leaves stuff in the sink for me to wash.

36
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,813
And last night
she forced us to watch

37
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,835
an A and E biography
on Susan Saint James.

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,645
What's your point, lieutenant?
- You let in an outsider.

39
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,069
She's getting in the way of this mission.

40
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,914
I'm giving you an opportunity
to observe her up close.

41
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,113
Well, she's
no Jo Anne Worley, but,

42
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:41,898
Quarters to her.

43
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,786
Hello, Tommy.

44
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,302
I really want the two of us to be friends.

45
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,219
Don't you have any friends of your own?

46
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,708
You're probably
very confused

47
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:57,073
about what's going on
between your father and me.

48
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,819
No, not really.
I have excellent hearing.

49
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:03,956
I just want you to know
that your father and I

50
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,237
are going to be seeing a
lot more of each other.

51
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:08,886
Oh, wow.
How much could possibly be left?

52
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,889
Well, gotta go.
See you at the office.

53
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,584
I have an idea.
Why don't I ride with you?

54
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,057
Ahh, I think it would be
a better idea

55
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,704
if we rode separately,
if you know what I mean.

56
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,276
I don't know what you mean.

57
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:23,491
Well, People might start thinking

58
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:25,409
that we're
sleeping together.

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,869
What?!
- We are.

60
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,630
We are, I swear.

61
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:32,596
Why can't you two
just ride together?

62
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,989
I need the car to go shopping.
- I need a ride downtown.

63
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,966
It's just not
a good idea.

64
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,133
Why not?
- This is exactly what I was talking about.

65
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:42,431
She has a car...
- It's really none of our business...

66
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,504
You know what?!

67
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,126
I don't want to
start a fight here.

68
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,349
I think it's okay for you
to ride with me today.

69
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,620
Yes!
- Come on.

70
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:58,774
What's this?

71
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,602
I won.
I won 150 dollars!

72
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,808
You don't
understand, lady.

73
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,851
You owe "us" 150 dollars.

74
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:14,085
Oh, I see. So you lure me
down here to collect my prize.

75
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,152
Then you pull the old
bait and switch.

76
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,698
I'll take care
of this.

77
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,852
Sally?

78
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,162
Hello, Don.
It's been a long time.

79
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:30,730
I thought you walked out
of my life for good.

80
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,598
I'm back. I ran into
trouble out there in the city.

81
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,542
The city is full of trouble.

82
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,004
I found this on my car.

83
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,927
Parked in
a handicap zone.

84
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,854
I'm sure you had
a good reason.

85
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:51,760
Yes. It was the closest spot to the store.

86
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:54,314
Works for me.

87
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,726
Consider this taken care of.
- Just like that?

88
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,442
Just like that.

89
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,110
Wow.

90
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,744
Sally, can I take
you out tonight?

91
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,281
'Kay.

92
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:17,524
No. Stop it.
- We're not in the office.

93
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,178
Behave yourself.
- Let's go back in the car.

94
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:19,974
No!

95
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,321
Not in the car, not in the bar,

96
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,585
not in the house,
not up your blouse.

97
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:26,304
I cannot touch you here or
there. I cannot touch you anywhere.

98
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:31,633
Judith!
Father rice.

99
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,594
Hello, Dr. Albright.
- Dr. Solomon and I

100
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:36,343
just ran into each other on the way in.

101
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:38,869
Dr. Suter.
What?

102
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,988
I said, Dr. Suter!

103
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,043
You again!

104
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,788
Here, here, do you need any help?

105
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,550
Get away from me.

106
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,073
Good for you!
Stay independent!

107
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,659
Dick, rumor has it,

108
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,388
that you and a certain
anthropology professor are..

109
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,636
uh... going
at it pretty good.

110
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:04,029
I don't know what
you're talking about.

111
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,302
Yeah, right.

112
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:14,371
I gotta get me
an anvil.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,923
Harry, I need a ride.

114
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,704
No.

115
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:22,072
You know, I outrank you.

116
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,931
Oh. Well, in that case, no, sir.

117
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,879
Please?
Just give me a ride.

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,755
Look, come on. Can't you see that I'm busy?

119
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,325
What, is it
too much to ask

120
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,662
for a little time
for Harry?

121
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,120
I'll tell you what.

122
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,110
If the roadrunner wins
this next one, you take me.

123
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,848
But if he doesn't,
I'll never ask you again.

124
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,265
Okay, you're on.

125
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:50,489
I've seen this
next scheme before,

126
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,691
and it's far too brilliant to fail twice.

127
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,052
Let's go.

128
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:04,611
you're wrong.
- I'm right.

129
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,375
You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

130
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,801
You're wrong
about that, too.

131
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,296
There's no way to observe a
society without intruding.

132
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,858
One can't help but leave footprints.

133
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:13,999
Of course not.
I've seen your bipedal gait.

134
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,108
So let me get
this straight.

135
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,553
You're saying that you
could drop right out of the sky

136
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,314
into some strange culture and
walk amongst them unnoticed?

137
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:23,411
Yes!

138
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:25,127
Hypothetically.

139
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:28,031
Mary, you're an anthropologist,
back me up.

140
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,233
I'm afraid I'd have
to agree with Dr. Solomon.

141
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,554
Of course.
What was I thinking?

142
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,430
You're sleeping
with him.

143
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,139
This is a disaster, Dick.
Everybody's talking about us.

144
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, we're back
to that again.

145
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,795
You just
don't understand.

146
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,371
I've worked hard
to be taken seriously.

147
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,426
There was a time when I had a reputation.

148
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:55,648
For excellence?

149
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:00,966
Well, yes,

150
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,974
but in a very
specific category.

151
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:06,523
When I was a young
professor on the fast track,

152
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,073
there were things that I did.

153
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,429
Well what were you doing?

154
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:11,352
The Dean.

155
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,130
Is that like
the Watusi?

156
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,158
Sometimes.

157
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,726
There was this very prestigious job opening.

158
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:21,808
Did you get it?

159
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,381
No, I didn't
get the job,

160
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,649
but I did get
a nickname..

161
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,063
Dr. Mary Slutbunny.

162
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,563
Well, there's
your silver lining.

163
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:33,969
You just don't
get it, do you?

164
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,927
When a man has an office
romance, it doesn't affect his career.

165
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,483
But when a woman has one,
no one takes her seriously.

166
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:41,552
I don't understand.

167
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,631
I don't expect you to.

168
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,072
I need to be
alone tonight.

169
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:47,401
But I'm not
like that.

170
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,386
I take you seriously,
Dr. Slutbunny.

171
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:57,641
Sally, you look
beautiful.

172
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:01,037
Oh, Don, that's just
the doughnuts talking.

173
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,956
What you did today
was really powerful.

174
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:07,816
I mean you just snapped your
fingers and things fell into place.

175
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,192
Let's just keep that our
little secret, shall we?

176
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:12,380
Okay.

177
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,985
Would you like
another doughnut?

178
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,995
I don't know, are you sure you can afford it?

179
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:19,937
I get 'em for free,

180
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,589
all except
the cream-filled,

181
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,033
but all that will change
when I make detective.

182
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,439
That day
will come, Don.

183
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,234
We'll make it come.

184
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,054
And then...

185
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,749
we can eat
cream-Filled..

186
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,970
together.

187
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,029
One-David-niner. One-David-niner. Copy that.

188
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,013
2-18?
2-18.

189
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:48,978
What is it?
- It's a 2-18.

190
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,643
I have to go.
- Take me with you.

191
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,157
I can't.
- Please?

192
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,031
Let's ride.
- Oh, goody!

193
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,187
That was
so exhilarating, Don.

194
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,857
I've never been
on a raid before.

195
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,620
Come to think of it,
I've never held a criminal

196
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,507
off the roof of a warehouse by his ankles

197
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,652
until he screamed,
"mommy"!

198
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:14,783
Oh, mommy.

199
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:18,664
Sally, you make me
feel alive,

200
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:22,005
like I've dropped
a stun gun down my pants.

201
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:25,492
Hey, Don,
do it again.

202
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:26,539
Sally,

203
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,642
you're insatiable.

204
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,275
You're home
awfully late.

205
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,500
I had a great time tonight.

206
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,970
Dick, I think I've finally found my calling.

207
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:49,584
What?

208
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,272
I'm joining the police force.

209
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:51,984
Why?

210
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,867
Because I can make a difference.

211
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,963
I'm sorry, lieutenant,
but I forbid it.

212
00:10:55,964 --> 00:10:56,575
Why?

213
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:58,257
Because you will make a difference.

214
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,288
Say you clean up Rutherford. What's next?

215
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,760
Cleveland.
- Exactly.

216
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,653
Then you clean up Ohio.
- That's the plan.

217
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,973
Soon, the entire Midwest
is crime-free.

218
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,497
What's going to happen
to all those people

219
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,661
whose income
depends on crime?

220
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:13,212
The lawyers, the insurance
companies, the 11:00 news?

221
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,843
Hell, the entire
fox network?

222
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,901
There are worldwide
implications here.

223
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,927
We're not supposed to
interfere with life on this planet.

224
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,918
Why can't I interfere with the planet? You do.

225
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:23,994
I do not!

226
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:25,823
What do you call what
you're doing with Dr. Albright?

227
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,947
That's different.

228
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:29,858
When you're in love with someone,
you're allowed to completely screw up their life.

229
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,181
That's what love is.

230
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:35,037
I understand.
I'll talk to Don.

231
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:36,936
Thank you,
lieutenant.

232
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,989
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to bed.

233
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:42,093
I can't be around you
with a nightstick right now.

234
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,653
Yes,

235
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:50,256
I seem to have
that effect on women.

236
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,610
Hey.

237
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:04,786
Would you please
take it outside?

238
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:18,010
If only I could be that spoon.
- Stop it.

239
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,917
You let me be
the spoon yesterday.

240
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:25,094
Cut it out.
- Come on!

241
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,051
Dick, we're
professionals.

242
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:28,806
We have reputations
to protect.

243
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,861
We're not kids anymore.

244
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:31,514
Oh, I see.
The looser the skin,

245
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,410
the tighter the behavior.
Is that it?

246
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:38,271
Just let me be the spoon once. Please?

247
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,170
Fine. Just this once.

248
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:56,975
You're about
a quart low.

249
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,669
From now on, I'm just going
to slide things under the door.

250
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,169
The two of you
haven't RSVP'd

251
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,508
the trustees' cocktail
reception tomorrow night.

252
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,469
Well, I can't speak
for Dr. Solomon,

253
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,069
but I'll be there.

254
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,390
Nina, can I ask you something?

255
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,033
Damn! I almost made it.

256
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,645
There's a man
and a woman,

257
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,409
and the woman won't let
the man near her in public.

258
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,590
The man is very frustrated. What should he do

259
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:29,300
when all he wants is climb to
the top of the engineering tower

260
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,921
and proclaim his love
for all the campus to hear?

261
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,119
Well I wouldn't do that if I were him.

262
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,918
Well why not?

263
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,192
Because Dr. Albright
would kill him dead.

264
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,547
Fine.

265
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,543
I won't.

266
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,989
I don't know what
came over her.

267
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,713
Same old story.
She wants more space.

268
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,691
I don't know how
to give it to her..

269
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,627
Wait...I've got it.

270
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,761
I'll go out and buy
two dozen roses,

271
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,484
and then I'll put a little
note on each rose that says,

272
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,519
"hope you're enjoying
your space".

273
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,576
Then I'll take one over every
hour on the hour and give it to her.

274
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,362
If she's not there, I'll
leave it on her doorstep.

275
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:13,441
No Dick, that doesn't sound
like a very good idea.

276
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:14,650
Look, do you
want her back,

277
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,684
or do you want her to think you're an idiot?

278
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:20,043
I want her back.

279
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,467
Well, you've got to play it cool.

280
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,462
You have to act like
you couldn't care less

281
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,037
whether she likes you or not.

282
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:25,611
But I do.

283
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,128
No, you don't.

284
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,742
Yes, I do!
No, you don't.

285
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,853
Oh, right.

286
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:36,241
Maybe I don't.
There you go.

287
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,454
But I do!
- No!

288
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,860
Trust me, she'll come crawling back.

289
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,504
I know what
I'm talking about.

290
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:44,857
I've been married
five times.

291
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,525
Yeah, Women.

292
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,931
Or so I've heard.

293
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,907
I understand,
Mrs. Bittenson.

294
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:04,276
His tree is dropping fruit on your property.

295
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,231
It's just that the police
department can't do anything at this time

296
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,682
except dispatch three
black-And-whites asap

297
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:10,800
to that
dirtbag's house

298
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:14,683
and gas him until he picks
up every last one of those...

299
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,059
figs.

300
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,796
I'm sorry, Sally. You just
walked into a hornet's nest here.

301
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,296
You work so hard, officer Don.

302
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,786
Rusty, Rico.

303
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,872
Protect and serve.
That's what I do..

304
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,824
protect and serve.

305
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,927
I got something to tell you,
and it's going to hurt.

306
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:32,644
Then make it quick.

307
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:33,733
I can't join the force.

308
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:34,598
But you're so good.

309
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,369
I'm the best, but it's too
much power for one person to have.

310
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,711
I'd affect too many lives.

311
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,893
No, there's no power.

312
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:42,822
I do nothing. I'm completely ineffectual.

313
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,222
Here's your stick.

314
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,361
I'll never forget
you, Smokey.

315
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,337
You'll be back.

316
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:59,824
A woman like you
can't stay away.

317
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,342
Maybe.

318
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,009
Be careful
out there.

319
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,715
So are we sending
the squad cars

320
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,125
to collect those figs?

321
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:17,180
Um... no, no.
I'll just, um...

322
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:18,771
pick 'em up
on my way home.

323
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:25,863
Oh, my god.
Here he comes.

324
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:28,130
They're going to have a field day with this one.

325
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,873
It's okayDr Albright Just. Calm down.

326
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:31,317
Nina!

327
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,441
It's so good to see you,

328
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,473
and only you.

329
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,512
Oh, Dr. Solomon,

330
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:40,642
I've never seen you with
a turtleneck before.

331
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:42,467
His name is Harry.

332
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,896
Dr. Suter!
Oh, and Mrs. Sumner!

333
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,879
You look lovely
this evening.

334
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,983
Oh, well, thank..
no!

335
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:14,329
Mmm! This is great dip, Mrs. Sumner.

336
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,330
It's pâté.

337
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,701
This is great dip pâté.

338
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,424
What's she doing?
You don't care.

339
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,746
Oh... right.

340
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:28,948
Dick, is there
something..

341
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:32,185
Martini, dry. Not too dry. Moist, very moist.

342
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,923
I see.
You're punishing me.

343
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:37,525
Fine.

344
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,960
You're good.
- Smooth.

345
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,261
But it's so hard.

346
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,940
Stay strong big guy.

347
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,651
Trouble in
paradise, Mary?

348
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,837
Oh, shut up.

349
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,606
Don't you have
anything better to do?

350
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,510
Why don't you get a life so
I'll have somebody to talk about?

351
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,783
Ouch.

352
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:04,572
Oh, I love
these things.

353
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,084
 May I?

354
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,752
This isn't metric,
is it?

355
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,250
I didn't know you played.
- No, I'm not playing, I'm adding.

356
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:24,372
Not the way I would have done it.

357
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,913
Whatever.

358
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,894
I'll never understand
this human obsession

359
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,726
with what other
people think.

360
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,106
I don't care
what anybody thinks.

361
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,866
You know, Harry, maybe you
should care just a little.

362
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,895
Sally, how did you leave it
with officer Don?

363
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,924
Open. I've never been
out with a guy like him.

364
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,795
I've been wined
and dined,

365
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:48,981
but I've never
been doughnut-ed.

366
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:50,779
I like it.

367
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,825
I'd like to be breaded
and deep fried.

368
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:59,356
And I don't care what
anybody thinks of it.

369
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,754
You're right Harry. The only voice that
matters is the one inside your head.

370
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:05,052
Ha! Which one?

371
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,253
Shut up.

372
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,767
Mary Albright
is mine!

373
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:25,385
Dick Solomon
is mine!

374
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:29,538
You on the
roof, put down the bullhorn!

375
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,069
There have been
complaints.

376
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,471
Put down
the bullhorn!

377
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,911
Thanks, Don.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

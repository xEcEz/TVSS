1
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:04,557
Tom: and this is our kitchen. 

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,492
well, kitchen... Area.

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:09,529
Very exciting.

4
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,765
And yet I yawn for
some reason.

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:12,899
Do you have any
cappuccino?

6
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,367
We don't have a
cappuccino machine.

7
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,902
Espresso?

8
00:00:15,937 --> 00:00:17,037
Instant coffee?

9
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,639
i'm assuming you
have a kettle.

10
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:21,208
Of course we have a kettle.

11
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,210
Tom, your mom wants
her kettle back.

12
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:25,245
But I was just gonna
make monica a coffee.

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,448
Monica, come down to the real kitchen;
i'll make you something decent.

14
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:34,087
Ok, is it just me, or does your mom
still think you and I are kind of a joke?

15
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,622
No, no. That's just
how mom talks.

16
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,190
Doesn't mean anything,
right, monica?

17
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:40,260
Boring. I think the question is:
why don't you have your own stuff?

18
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:41,795
Oh well. You know the saying.

19
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,563
"the best things in
life aren't things. "

20
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:44,765
yeah, that's not true.

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,300
The problem is you haven't
had a bridal shower.

22
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:49,102
Oh no, I don't
believe in...

23
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,271
Still boring. Look,
i'll tell you what.

24
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,141
We're gonna organize a bridal shower
and invite all of mom's rich friends.

25
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,542
This place will look
like the back of a mob truck.

26
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:57,477
I don't know.

27
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,680
Mom does like to
plan a party.

28
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,949
Could be a good chance
for you guys to bond.

29
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,384
You think?

30
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:07,453
So let me get this straight:
the back of a a mob truck thing

31
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:09,722
doesn't really do it for
you, but the bonding does.

32
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:11,691
God, you two are so weird.

33
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,827
Thanks for this, monica.

34
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,128
Your happiness is
thanks enough.

35
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:17,530
And, I get first pick
of the gifts. Ciao!

36
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,033
I'm still worried your mom
doesn't take us seriously.

37
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,835
You are being crazy.

38
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,339
Look, I will you a killer breakfast
and we'll forget all about it.

39
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:28,441
Just gotta borrow
the frying pan.

40
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:39,886
<i>boy: can't we find a way
that we could be together? </i>

41
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,823
<i>girl:  is there any way
that we could be together? </i>

42
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:49,129
<i>both:  and oh by the
way, baby, do you love me? </i>

43
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:56,369
<i> yes, I do! Yes, I do!
yes, I do! </i>

44
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,644
<i> wait. Jessie's
having a bridal shower?</i>

45
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,146
that's awesome.

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,780
Yeah, I don't think
we're invited.

47
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,515
No, idiot, see?

48
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,854
If jessie has a shower, that
means you get a bachelor party.

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,488
It's called status quo.

50
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,023
Do you mean quid pro quo?

51
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:18,959
Exactly. Tit for tit.

52
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:19,592
It's tat.

53
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,327
What'd I say?

54
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,094
tit.

55
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,696
You said tit.

56
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,298
Maybe you're right.

57
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,401
A bachelor party could be a good
excuse to get away from the family.

58
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:31,004
What's this? Did I hear
something about a bachelor party?

59
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:32,739
Uh, well uh...

60
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,607
Party is kind of
overstating it.

61
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:39,412
Tom and I were just planning on
having a nice dinner together.

62
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,915
Oh, that sounds nice, girls,
but you leave it to me.

63
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,751
I've been known to plan a
bachelor party or two in my day.

64
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:46,619
Oh. Good.

65
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:50,523
Cause that would mean
you'd... You'd come?

66
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,525
<i>Monica: so for food, we'll
need some hors d'oeuvres</i>

67
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,060
and sandwich trays.

68
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:56,662
No problem. I'll
call frangelico's.

69
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:59,900
No. No frangelico's; their
products aren't fair trade.

70
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,334
Well first off,
you don't trade.

71
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:04,004
You give them money.
Lots, in fact.

72
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,338
I got it, princess.

73
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:07,207
Frangelico's will
be fine, mom.

74
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,842
Judith, maybe you and I can
work on the menu together.

75
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,978
Oh. That's ok, I
have it covered.

76
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,014
<i>Monica: i'll take care
of drinks and decorations. </i>

77
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,616
and I suppose we'll have
to plan some shower games.

78
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,618
Like what,
pin-the-veil-on-the-bride?

79
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,720
You know that's a
real thing, right?

80
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:24,124
Wow. I am never
getting married.

81
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,960
Maybe you and I could come
up with some games together.

82
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,362
It's ok, I have a book
around here somewhere.

83
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,931
<i>I'll take care of it. </i>

84
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,132
<i>ben:
i love bachelor parties!</i>

85
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,334
hey, why not have it
right here at the house?

86
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,837
That way I get to meet all your chums
and kick their butts at ping pong.

87
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,339
<i></i>

88
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,873
oh darn.

89
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:44,144
We're planning on having it the
same night as jessie's shower so...

90
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,478
<i>Phil: you guys
talking bachelor party?</i>

91
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:46,813
evidently.

92
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:49,316
If you're looking for a venue,
you could have it here.

93
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,683
Yeah, I don't
think my dad...

94
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:51,418
Done.

95
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:52,885
Really?

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,721
Now listen; these boys are young,
so I don't want any blue movies

97
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,791
but I thought we could get those little
swizzle sticks shaped like naked ladies.

98
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,093
I love those!

99
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:01,761
Now they get along.

100
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,430
<i>Monica:
so invites?</i>

101
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,498
here we go.

102
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>They're made from
composted material</i>

103
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,302
and coloured
with vegetable dye.

104
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:13,440
Is that... Barley?

105
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:14,607
Buckwheat.

106
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,943
I took the liberty of
drawing up a guest list.

107
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,713
Are these arranged in
order of net worth?

108
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,415
Alphabetical tells
us nothing.

109
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,417
I have a list of my
friends too, judith.

110
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,551
Should we combine them?

111
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,120
No, that's fine.

112
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:29,689
Why don't you send your
invitations and I'll send mine.

113
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,691
There's no point in
over-complicating things.

114
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,461
We're, uh...

115
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,262
We're really starting to bond.

116
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,931
Yeah, I'm jealous.

117
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,002
The only reason I agreed to a
shower was to bond with your mom,

118
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,336
and now she
won't let me.

119
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,171
Whatever do you mean?

120
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:48,674
Well, I keep suggesting fun things we can
work on together, you know, as a team...

121
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,742
Ok. Stop right there.

122
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,111
What?

123
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,646
My mom doesn't exactly
do the "team" thing.

124
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,018
You want to connect with her, there's
gotta be a little give and... Give.

125
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,853
Stay away from words like
"together" and "team".

126
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:02,055
And "fun. "

127
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,689
what does that leave?

128
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:05,291
Tagging along.

129
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:08,961
So if I want your mom to like me,
i'm supposed to just follow her around

130
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,463
and agree to
whatever she wants?

131
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:11,764
No, I...

132
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:14,467
Yeah, actually,
that's it exactly!

133
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,902
I want to write that down.

134
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,138
How did you say it, again?
It was really concise.

135
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,506
tom!

136
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,841
Look on the bright side.

137
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,577
My dad could be
planning your shower.

138
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,346
Your father might throw
a good bachelor party.

139
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,347
You don't know.

140
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,548
Yeah, I do.

141
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,250
My dad's not good
at parties.

142
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:37,290
If either party disagrees with my decision,
they can file what's called an appeal.

143
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,858
Now an appeal... Yes?

144
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:40,760
Can you cast spells
with your hammer?

145
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,529
I'm not a wizard, kid.
I'm a judge.

146
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,098
And this is a gavel. Ok?

147
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,334
My friends come to this party
and I can kiss my rep goodbye.

148
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:51,071
Really?

149
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:52,172
"rep?"

150
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,173
no good?

151
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:55,007
Yeah, nobody talks
like that anymore.

152
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,642
I'll tell you one thing.

153
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:00,447
Our friends come to this party,
you can kiss your rep goodbye.

154
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,814
So what do I do now?

155
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,116
Dead simple.

156
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,385
We party with your two
dads at the hill's place...

157
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,420
I wish you wouldn't
call them my two dads.

158
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:10,490
...but we tell the boys to
meet us at the frat house,

159
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:12,925
where the real party
kicks in

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,062
after your father nods
off watching fox news.

161
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,097
The frat house?

162
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:18,831
Yeah, the frat house!

163
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:22,668
I mean we got tunes, beers,
guys acting like idiots...

164
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:26,106
Cool, so like any other night at the
frat house except there won't be girls.

165
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,243
Jeez, when you say it
like that it sounds lame.

166
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:32,812
Oh, wait, no, there's
gonna be a stripper.

167
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,581
Ha ha. I forgot to
mention the stripper.

168
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:35,915
I would've led
with the stripper.

169
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:36,916
Yeah, good note.

170
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,289


171
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,958
I don't think the shower guests
are going to want to play

172
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:48,161
a hannah montana
board game, sweetie.

173
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,562
There's a drinking version.

174
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,368
Anything I can do to help
with party prep, judith?

175
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,369
I don't think so.

176
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,303
Invitations?

177
00:06:57,338 --> 00:06:58,304
Taken care of.

178
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,473
Picking them
up right now. Decorations?

179
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,874
Music?

180
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,143
I've got plenty of cds.

181
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:06,646
wow.

182
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,581
These are great.

183
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,550
Michael buble.

184
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,252
The lighter side of...

185
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,719
Michael buble.

186
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:15,255
You're really good at this.

187
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,756
Thank you, jessie.

188
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,662
Um, could I come with you
to pick up the decorations?

189
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:24,531
I've already chosen the
colour scheme, you know.

190
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:25,998
Oh no, I know, I know.

191
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:29,869
I just... I thought it might be
fun to maybe, carry a box?

192
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:32,338
Sure. Why not?

193
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:33,673
ok.

194
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:44,150


195
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:45,117
That was fun.

196
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,886
I'm glad we got to
spend time together.

197
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,853
You know what?

198
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,289
I am too.

199
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:50,456
You sound surprised.

200
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,892
Well, I usually do this
sort of thing on my own.

201
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:54,026
Oh, that's silly, judith.

202
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,828
You're not a control freak.

203
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,865
Who said I was?

204
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,334
Nobody.

205
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,102
Hey, here's something!

206
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:05,572
Did you know I've always
loved those jeans on you?

207
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:07,973
Yeah. You have such
great taste in...

208
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,310
High-waisted pants.

209
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:11,711
Really?

210
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:14,614
Yeah. Maybe someday you can
show me where you buy them.

211
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:17,983
Well, the stores are
open for another hour.

212
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,652
oh.

213
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,820
Taxi!

214
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:29,061


215
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:31,097
Oh, let me help you there.

216
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,532
Oh, thanks.

217
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,569
Tonight's really
gonna be fun.

218
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,571
Way better than
tom's bachelor thing.

219
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,574
Oh, I don't know. Ben
throws a pretty good party.

220
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:47,913
And then they burned
my village down.

221
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:52,151

223
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,589
ok. Well.

224
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:59,125
Maybe wedding night stories
weren't such a great idea.

225
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,630
What say we kick this party into
high gear with a little chateau hill?

226
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,231
<i>
yes! All right!</i>

227
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:08,301
no, no phil. I can't allow
that. These boys are underage.

228
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,003
I'll see you later.

229
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:12,071
Where are you going?

230
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,273
Anywhere but here.

231
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,044
<i> </i>

232
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,613
<i>ava:
these are judith's friends?</i>

233
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:23,383
they're a little more
candle-and-sandal than I expected.

234
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:25,818
These are my friends.

235
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,820
Oh. They're nice.

236
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:34,093
We need a cork screw, and b
where the hell are mom's friends?

237
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:35,695
It's early. The party
just started.

238
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:39,231
I didn't suggest this so I could get
a bunch of hand-knitted tea cozies.

239
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,000
I want my weight in
cold hard appliances.

240
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,935
You said you just
wanted one gift.

241
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,804
I re-negotiated the
terms of our agreement.

242
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:45,772
You weren't there.

243
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:46,572
But...

244
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,274
Cork screw.

245
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:49,509

247
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,826
jessie?

248
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,295
You never mailed the
invitations to your friends?

249
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,464
Wait. It's not as bad
as you think.

250
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:13,499
<i>It's not that i
don't like you;</i>

251
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:16,803
it's just that, I haven't
told any of my friends

252
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:20,406
that tom got
married... To you.

253
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,408
How is that not
as bad as I think?

254
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,610
Ok, you're right. It is
as bad as you think.

255
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:25,712
You know what?

256
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:27,246
This party was a
terrible idea.

257
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,917


258
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,252
I've been to worse.

259
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,885
Nora:
this is fun. 

260
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,321
how come you never had a
shower for your wedding, tara?

261
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:47,024
Because phil and I never
actually got married, remember?

262
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,893
That's great.

263
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:52,263
Jerry and I have an
open relationship, too.

264
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,498
We don't have an
open relationship.

265
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:56,901
Yeah, no, we
don't either.

266
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,072
Hey jess. You ok?

267
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:05,409
Great. Just great.

268
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:09,346
Come on, I know
that you're upset. Spill.

269
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,917
Tom's mother didn't invite any of her friends
because she's embarrassed tom married me

270
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:15,319
and she's never going to accept
me; she's a miserable shrew

271
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:18,022
and those high-waisted
jeans chafed my ribcage.

272
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,291
Man, when somebody
says spill, you spill.

273
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:22,059
<i>Tara:
everyone?</i>

274
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:26,230
I would like to propose a
toast to a very special lady.

275
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:29,433
<i>I think you all know
who I'm talking about. </i>

276
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:34,738
<i>our hostess, judith bellow,
party planner extraordinaire,</i>

277
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:37,708
and someone who obviously
loves jessie very much.

278
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,710
Everyone.

279
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,744
To judith!

280
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,612
<i>All:

281
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:43,814
to judith.

282
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,886
Yahtzee!

283
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,521
Hoo hoo.

284
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:54,124
Man oh man, this
place is dead.

285
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,093
You sure you gave your
friends the right address?

286
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,329
More so with each
passing second.

287
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:00,164
Boy, I could use a soda pop.

288
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:03,700
How's the real party going?

289
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,736
Check it out.

290
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,772
I did not know a dog
could funnel beer.

291
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,607
I can't believe we're
missing this party.

292
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:13,110
<i>I thought your dad
would be asleep by now. </i>

293
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:15,746
it's eight-thirty. How
old did you think he was?

294
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,647
I dunno. Seventy?

295
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:19,049
What are you
guys looking at?

296
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:22,486
Uh, an application that
tracks climate change.

297
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,487
Apparently it's
still happening.

298
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:24,989
Let's see.

299
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:28,192
Now that is a par-tay.

300
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,094
What's this?

301
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,562
Oh, this is going
on right now, is it?

302
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,565
Uh, yeah. I guess the
guys at the frat house

303
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,434
are having a thing
tonight, too.

304
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:40,337
So if you boys would rather go
there, it's all right with us.

305
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,238
Seriously?

306
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:42,506
Sure, why not?

307
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,673
All right!

308
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:45,675
Whose car are we taking?

309
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,378

310
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,412
<i></i>

311
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:54,351
we're about to start the
games. Are you coming?

312
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,320
I guess I didn't
get my invitation.

313
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:57,955
I deserve that.

314
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,824
Why don't you just admit that you still
don't take this marriage seriously?

315
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:02,726
All right!

316
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,995
I don't take it seriously.

317
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,398
You want to know what really went through my head?
- Yeah.

318
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:11,768
I thought that maybe if I don't tell my
friends that my 18-year-old son got married,

319
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:15,139
then maybe I won't have to tell
them when he gets divorced.

320
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,507
I can't believe
you just said that.

321
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,510
Well? Don't ask the question if
you don't want to hear the answer.

322
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,879
We're not going to
get divorced, judith!

323
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,315
We love each other.

324
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,951
You don't know what love is.
You met when you were children.

325
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,285
So what?

326
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,722
When I met ben, I was an adult.
I remember every detail:

327
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:34,691
his crisp blue blazer,

328
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,028
the sweat on his upper lip as he hurled
insults at the "no nukes" protesters.

329
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,264
<i>That's when I knew he
was the one for me. </i>

330
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:44,501
I just want my son
to have what I have.

331
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:47,838
Instead he marries
the girl next door.

332
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,974
That's not love,
it's convenience.

333
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:52,276
Well, thank you for
clearing that up.

334
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,643
I've gotta go lie down.

335
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:57,114


336
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,151
Um, we're out of
salmon thingies?

337
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:07,124

339
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,833
the philster!

340
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,168
How do they know you?

341
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:20,837
I was the condom rep on
campus for a couple of weeks.

342
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,906
How do you think they
learned to play fris-beer?

343
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,608
Yo! You are nuts.

344
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:28,312
This might not be so bad.

345
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:31,615
Narc!

346
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,988
Ok everyone, we're going
to play the newlywed game.

347
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,990
So we quizzed tom on a
bunch of questions

348
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,959
and now we're gonna see how well
jessie knows my idiot brother.

349
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:45,362
I mean, her loving
husband... Who's an idiot.

350
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:48,232
And if she gets the answer
wrong, she has to take a drink?

351
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:51,735
No. So the first question comes
from tara, mother of the bride.

352
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,339
All right.

353
00:14:55,373 --> 00:15:00,744
For ten points: what did tom say his
favourite fast food restaurant was?

354
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,546
Does it matter?

355
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,749
No one thinks this marriage
is going to last anyway.

356
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,285
I'm sorry, the answer we
were looking for was arby's!

357
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,620
Arby's.

358
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:18,162


359
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:19,629
Hey, bellow, is that your dad?

360
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:20,997
Yeah, it is.

361
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,933
Thanks, buddy.

362
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,034
He's old.

363
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:28,205
And he's killing his liver.

364
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,375
<i>Woman: all right,
everybody, knock it off!</i>

365
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,879

you're all in here partying
like a bunch of animals.

It's been such a long time.
We have to catch up!

Absolutely. Listen, go easy
on him, will you, sweetheart?

380
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,394
It's my son.

385
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,939
she's been in and out of my courtroom
a few times and I decided to be lenient.

386
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,307
<i>You know, get her
some counselling. </i>

389
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,912
Yeah.

390
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,081
But she used to be
an investment banker.

391
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:52,256
"what would your husband like to have
more than anything else in the world?"

392
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,724
a second shot at happiness
with someone he hasn't met?

393
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,493
Hmm, is everything
ok, jess?

394
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,796
Yeah, sweetie. I mean I don't want to
get all motherly on you or anything,

395
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,831

at this game.

00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:10,440
Ok, jess. Moving on to the next
question so we can move on to the gifts.

400
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:13,810
What would tom say was the moment
the two of you both fell in love?

401
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,050
Well. Um, I can't say for sure
what the moment for tom was.

402
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:23,820
<i>But I remember mine. </i>

403
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,822
it was the first grade.

404
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:29,226
I was the new kid
and kind of shy.

405
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,197
I looked across the
playground and there was tom.

406
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:40,937
<i>in blue overalls, sneakers
and mismatched socks. </i>

<i>i couldn't take my
eyes off him. </i>

<i>it was like time
slowed down. </i>

410
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:55,452
he smiled at me and then all of
a sudden he shouted - look out!

411
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:59,389
<i>And I turned and i just missed
being puked on by kent paulsen. </i>

long as I can remember, I just...

This guy's awesome.

there who's trying too hard.

432
00:18:56,614 --> 00:19:00,884
And another charitable donation
to save the bark beetle. Thank you.

433
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:04,421

I know, son.

461

You're unpopular, but
you're not that unpopular.

462

To be honest, I thought you'd embarrass
me but, you didn't totally suck.

463

life to see his father as a man, not just a dad.

00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:31,040
So uh, when do I get that
lesson on the perfect martini?

You mad at jessie;
jessie mad at you.

475
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,914
Monica going through
everybody's purses for cash.

476
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,484
You do know when you say
'all things considered',

477
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,254
you're not actually supposed
to consider all things.

478
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,190
Oh. Sorry, honey.

479
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,692
I did get to relive one
great memory, though.

480
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:25,862
The moment that we first met.

481
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,366
Ah... The chair lift.

482
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,036
The gondola?

483
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,138
Spain.

484
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:38,875
Way to ruin the perfect day.

485
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:41,344
But it wasn't a perf...

486
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,046
Go to sleep, ben.

1
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,667
(Kim) No!

2
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,884
(Dan) Keep moving.

3
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,811
(Dan) Shut up!

4
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,979
Put her down. Put her down.

5
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,859
(Rick) Keep movin'.

6
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,821
(Dan) Shut up! Let's go. Come on, keep goin'.

7
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,372
- We have to go back.
- She's dead.

8
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,374
- You don't know that.
- Get in!

9
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,670
- Take it easy.
- You better decide whose side you're on!

10
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:08,431
We can't just leave her
in the middle of the street.

11
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:13,100
Nina...

12
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:25,020
- Nina, l know you're upset.
- Of course l'm upset. What do you expect?

13
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:30,453
Sorry. Look, the reason why l had to leave
the office is because l got a call from Walsh.

14
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:34,487
He was meeting one of our agents,
Scott Baylor. He said he had evidence...

15
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:38,283
That led you to me, l know.
But you should have thought it through.

16
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,913
Nina, listen to me. Richard Walsh is dead.

17
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,128
- What?
- He was shot. l watched him die.

18
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,922
What is going on?

19
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:55,974
He was killed cos he had proof that people
within our agency are behind the Palmer hit.

20
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,553
- Who?
- l don't know yet.

21
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,483
Right before Richard died
he gave me that key card.

22
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:05,435
l'm hoping that's going to tell us.
Jamey's trying to break it down now.

23
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,528
- You trust Jamey?
- He did. l trust you.

24
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:12,025
The three of us have to work together.

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,533
From this point forward we have to
assume that we can trust nobody else.

26
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,915
- l understand.
- Good.

27
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,460
Are you all right?

28
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,339
Yeah.

29
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,711
Work the card with Jamey.
l have to make a call.

30
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:40,430
Agent Pierce wanted to talk to you.

31
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,979
- Fine. Give me a minute.
- lt's very important.

32
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,144
A minute.

33
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,649
(phone rings)

34
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,403
- Yeah?
- Find anything out?

35
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,950
lt's barely been half an hour
since you told me.

36
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,535
l need you to find out the source of this story.
Not first thing in the morning, now.

37
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:04,671
This can't be done over the phone.
l have to talk to some people in person.

38
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,998
l wanna hear something by four.

39
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,128
- You've gotta let me...
- (hangs up)

40
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,550
- Where were you?
- l went for a drive.

41
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:20,012
A drive? Alone, at this time of night?

42
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:23,224
- l just needed to get away for a while.
- Away from what?

43
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:29,069
Everything.

44
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:34,236
They haven't told you, have they?
There's been an assassination threat.

45
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,533
- That's what all the fuss is about?
- Yes.

46
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:44,911
l thought it was something serious.

47
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:57,551
Jack. l'm screening the passenger list.
Something doesn't add up here.

48
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:01,592
- What?
- 2B. Manifest shows an empty seat.

49
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:02,352
So?

50
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,314
According to the ticketing file, first class
was full. Plus there was a waiting list.

51
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:10,569
Why would the plane take off
with an empty seat?

52
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,111
This is good.
What time does Rayburn get in?

53
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,987
- Six.
- Wake him up. Bring him in now.

54
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,951
Jack.

55
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,248
OK. We've got something off the key card.

56
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:29,749
The encryption is complex. l've asked
Jamey to isolate sectors. She's extracted one.

57
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,383
Just part of one.

58
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:35,002
That's it, just an address?
What's that got to do with Palmer?

59
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:38,382
- lt doesn't say.
- Crosscheck it with his schedule.

60
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:43,433
- He's not going anywhere near it.
- Has he been near it since he came here?

61
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,351
No.

62
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,606
How about previous visits?
Connection to family members?

63
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,436
l can check. lt'll take time.

64
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,647
No. Let's see what
we can peel off. Start in here.

65
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,158
Just the address on San Fernando Road.

66
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,828
How long will it take you to access
the next level? Minutes or hours?

67
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,000
- Hours, most likely.
- We don't have hours.

68
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,577
l'll check out the address myself.

69
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,711
- You want some backup?
- No. l need you here.

70
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:22,179
- What's wrong?
- l can't access our decryption software.

71
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:28,601
Phones are down, too.

72
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,483
lt's a lockdown.

73
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:38,731
lt's Mason. Hide the key card.

74
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:42,321
l'll handle this.

75
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:58,218
Hello, Nina. These men are with lnternal
lnvestigations. You are in official lockdown.

76
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,878
- By what authority?
- District Office.

77
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:06,804
We're trying to stop an assassination. Can't
you find anything better to do than this?

78
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:11,642
Two agents died tonight. A lockdown's
standard procedure until we get answers.

79
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,936
- Where's Jack?
- l don't know.

80
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,985
Station two, coming your way.

81
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:38,418
Lockdown. Nobody leaves.

82
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,049
- Lockdown? Are you serious?
- No, l'm kidding.

83
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,259
- l gotta get some work from the car.
- You know the drill.

84
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:46,224
Fine. You take the keys.

85
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:05,783
All right. l assume you're all
familiar with lockdown procedures.

86
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:09,952
You remain in the building.
All communications will be monitored.

87
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:13,957
Any incoming calls without
secure access codes will be blocked.

88
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:19,551
ln the meantime, continue to work on the
systems available until notified otherwise.

89
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,306
Who called them in, Tony? You?

90
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,299
Yeah, me.

91
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:29,259
- Why?
- Somebody had to. Jack's out of control.

92
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,765
Meaning what?

93
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,643
Two agents are down.
Jack was there when it happened.

94
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,189
You can't believe he was involved in that.

95
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:39,314
Tell you the truth,
l don't know what to believe.

96
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:43,610
l'd hate to think this has
anything to do with me.

97
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:47,865
- You think what you want.
- (Mason) Could be here for quite a while.

98
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:51,033
He got past me.

99
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,337
All right, Nina, where'd he go?

100
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,916
l already told you, l don't know.

101
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:05,300
You let me know, we can
get things up and running.

102
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,307
l'm really sorry, George. l can't help you out.

103
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:10,469
Mm-hm. Me, too.

104
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,152
Senator, could l have a word with you?

105
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:41,922
l'm not sure you appreciate
the seriousness of this threat.

106
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,631
l get serious threats every morning.

107
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:49,299
With all due respect, this one's different.
lt's a pro from overseas.

108
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,716
- Who's behind it?
- We don't know.

109
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:58,151
But as l'm sure you're aware, an airliner
exploded an hour and a half ago outside LA.

110
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,642
- No survivors.
- There's some connection?

111
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:03,524
Again, we don't know. We're looking into it.

112
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,323
What do we know?

113
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:10,035
That these are serious people,
and they want you dead, today.

114
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:27,011
- What about my family?
- The threat is against you only.

115
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:30,631
But of course we'll increase
security for your family as well.

116
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,299
The main thing is your schedule.

117
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,931
Today's primary day.
l'm not gonna hide in my hotel room.

118
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,855
Understood, but we recommend some
changes. The breakfast, for example.

119
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:46,151
The breakfast is important. The top labour
leaders in the state are gonna be there.

120
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,317
We're trying to keep you alive.

121
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,245
And l'm trying to win an election.

122
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,571
(door opens)

123
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,083
Mom said you wanted to see me.

124
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:01,004
Wanted to make sure you're all right.
Why are you up?

125
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,209
lf l'm not sleeping by three, l'm not sleeping.

126
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,756
l was gonna watch some tube.
Wanna join me?

127
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:10,011
- Anything on this time of night?
- Nothing good.

128
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,092
l guess l'll pass.

129
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,269
Heard about the threat.

130
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,274
Don't worry about it.
They'll take good care of me.

131
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:23,986
They better.

132
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,396
You better get some rest.

133
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,056
l'm telling you, we have
to go back and get Janet.

134
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,809
Are you gonna tell
your girlfriend to shut her mouth?

135
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:59,353
- She's probably dead.
- What if she's not? She might need help.

136
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:07,236
Why do you always do what he tells you?
Why don't you think for yourself?

137
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:11,106
- Just leave it alone, OK?
- l can't. She's my friend.

138
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,044
You know, she may be right after all.

139
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:37,131
We should go back.
lf she's alive, she can lD us.

140
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,304
- We have to shut her up for good.
- What?! What are you saying?

141
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,565
You're gonna kill her?
You're gonna kill Janet, huh? Huh?

142
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,943
Close her mouth. Now!

143
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,866
l'm not gonna let you tie me up! No!

144
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,540
Sounds like she's gonna tie you up.

145
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:14,345
(Teri) l just hope the girls are still there.

146
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,519
(siren)

147
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,439
Oh, no.

148
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,857
l don't believe this.

149
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:54,421
Stay in your car, sir. Back in the car.

150
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:57,086
Keep your hands where l can see 'em.

151
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:04,515
- Do you know how fast you were drivin'?
- Yes. Our daughters are missing.

152
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:07,523
We got a phone call.
We're on our way to pick them up.

153
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:10,563
- Licence and registration.
- Did you hear what l said?

154
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,738
Officer, my name is Teri Bauer.
He's telling the truth.

155
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:18,284
We really could use your help. My daughter
just phoned from Platt's Auto Body.

156
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,904
Different last names.
One's married, one's not.

157
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:25,248
l just called 911 15 minutes ago.
Verify it if you want.

158
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:29,285
- You know what? l'm gonna do that.
- Yeah. Why don't you do that?

159
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,056
- Listen...
- l said remain in the car.

160
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,057
l understand that. Can we speed things up?
Write us a ticket so we can go?

161
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:50,057
The woman asked me to verify the 911.
That's what l'm trying to do.

162
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:54,101
You know, you are a real
piece of work. You know that?

163
00:14:56,324 --> 00:15:00,571
- My daughter is in trouble. We're finished.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

164
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:04,078
- (cop) Relax, everyone. Whoa.
- (York) Get your hands off me!

165
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:07,202
No. Stop. Don't do that.
Please, don't do this.

166
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:11,452
Ma'am, he just disobeyed
a direct order from a police officer.

167
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:16,128
- l'm afraid l'll have to place him under arrest.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

168
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,676
You know Richard Walsh was killed tonight.

169
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:02,550
Scott Baylor, too.

170
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,262
Did you know Jack was there
when it happened?

171
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,511
l don't know anything about it.

172
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,268
- And you have no idea where he is now?
- No.

173
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,108
- You're making a big mistake, Nina.
- No, you are.

174
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:21,567
When this lockdown is over,
l'll talk with the Double l team,

175
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,609
about some highly irregular banking
transactions traced to your account.

176
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:30,866
Trust me, the trouble Jack's in, my bank
accounts won't even raise an eyebrow.

177
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:36,623
He's going down, Nina. But that doesn't
mean you have to go down with him.

178
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,293
True love is a beautiful thing, but...

179
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,549
why go to extremes?

180
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:55,976
l know about the affair.
l mean, Jack talks about it all the time.

181
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,398
- Sure he does.
- How else would l know about it?

182
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:07,617
See, it is possible that Jack's not
the shining knight you think he is.

183
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,544
You wanna try again?

184
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:16,954
Where's Jack now?

185
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:59,792
(cop) This is Mary-138. Need a
transportation unit at the Fifth Street bridge.

186
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:03,003
- (phone rings)
- (cop) Ma'am. OK. Please, ma'am.

187
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,594
(radio) 1-M-38.
Repeat location with full request.

188
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,552
(cop) 1-Mary-38. l need a transportation unit.

189
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,137
(phone rings)

190
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,689
lt's Teri. Leave a message,
and l'll callyou back.

191
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:20,186
Honey, it's me. l'm just checking up
on Kim. l'll call you back soon.

192
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,244
Don't move.

193
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,710
Dammit!

194
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:16,306
2-Adam-14. Reporting shots fired at
18166 San Fernando Road. Request backup.

195
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:22,729
(radio) 2-Adam-14.
Backup on the way, 18166 San Fernando.

196
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:28,026
Stop! Police!

197
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:30,273
- Hold it right there!
- Federal agent.

198
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:33,736
- Your badge. Nice and slow.
- Putting my gun down.

199
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:42,869
- CTU? What the hell is that?
- Counter Terrorist Unit.

200
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:48,170
This guy is not waiting for me, so you
better shoot me or help me, but decide now.

201
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:54,012
- All right, l'll help you.
- l'm picking up my gun.

202
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,842
Easy.

203
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,770
You be careful with that gun. l need him alive.

204
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:17,821
Throw me your flashlight.

205
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,576
(phone rings)

206
00:21:57,662 --> 00:21:59,738
(Jack) Take cover.

207
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:20,674
- (radio) 2-Adam-14. Backup's on the way.
- 2-Adam-14. Copy.

208
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,845
Turn off your radio.

209
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:26,096
- l wish you hadn't called for backup.
- Why?

210
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:29,809
Cops have to play by the rules.
l'll have to break a few with this guy.

211
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:31,979
Who is he?

212
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:45,542
So to sum it up, Jack leaves his wife,
shacks up with you for a while,

213
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:50,621
gets bored, and then moves back home,
leaving you out in the cold.

214
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,588
My personal life is not your concern.

215
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:58,426
- lt is if it affects your work.
- lt doesn't affect my work.

216
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:05,850
How long have you been with
the agency, Nina? Six years, seven?

217
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:07,896
Seven years.

218
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:12,977
l remember when you first joined.
You were goin' places. Everybody knew it.

219
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:17,859
lt hasn't quite happened
for you yet, has it?

220
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:21,071
- You ever wonder why?
- l've done all right.

221
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:25,789
But you could have done so much better.
You had a great reputation once.

222
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,449
You know what your reputation is now?

223
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:32,915
Jack's flunky. His lapdog.

224
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:37,128
This is your chance
to get back on track, Nina.

225
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:41,634
He's a loose cannon.
Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer.

226
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:46,636
He does what he wants when he wants,
and he doesn't care whose life it affects.

227
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,481
He shot me with a trank gun,
for God's sakes.

228
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,732
- You withheld information.
- l was following orders.

229
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,571
Maybe he's following orders
you don't know about.

230
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:59,320
He violated lockdown,
and he left you holding the bag.

231
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:03,193
lf he cared about you,
he wouldn't have put you in that position.

232
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,040
Let me ask you, would you
have done that to him?

233
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:13,170
Fact is, l'm just asking you to do
your job and tell me where he is.

234
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,834
l don't know.

235
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,239
(squeaking)

236
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,406
(Jack) Get down! Get down!

237
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:55,035
(in Spanish)

238
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,207
(janitor) Sí. Bueno.

239
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,600
(sobs)

240
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:26,574
- (Rick) Maybe she's dead after all.
- (Dan) We have to be sure.

241
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:37,130
- Let's just put her in the van.
- No.

242
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,096
- Dan...
- Shut up!

243
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:09,031
(siren)

244
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:10,949
Move it!

245
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:07,879
Yeah?

246
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:11,341
- Mason's gonna wanna talk to you.
- What do you want me to say?

247
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:15,384
Jack's made it clear that
the three of us work in confidence.

248
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:19,476
- But doesn't Mason supersede Jack?
- No, no.

249
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,438
What we're doing came from Walsh.

250
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,901
George will say anything to get you to talk.

251
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,233
Do not be intimidated by him.

252
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,235
OK.

253
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:08,899
Cross me.

254
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:32,131
(creaking)

255
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:45,269
(running footsteps)

256
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:52,071
- The other building.
- Jeez, this place is like a maze.

257
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:57,864
(Carl) All right. l've got a name.
George Ferragamo. Know him?

258
00:28:57,957 --> 00:29:00,448
Yeah. l know the name.

259
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:06,789
You find anything else, leave
a message on the 802 number only.

260
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:09,421
OK. You got it.

261
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,587
Thanks, Carl.

262
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,786
You've been spending an awful lot of time
behind closed doors, making phone calls.

263
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:45,499
- Have l?
- What's going on, David?

264
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,462
Phone call earlier tonight
from Maureen Kingsley.

265
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:02,931
She's digging up old history.

266
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:05,099
Bad history.

267
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:08,685
Just tell me.

268
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,740
She claims that Keith
murdered the boy who raped Nicole.

269
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:23,204
What?

270
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:27,587
Well, first, Lyle Gibson
was no boy. He was 19.

271
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:31,966
Second, he killed himself.
The coroner's report proved it.

272
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:35,836
- Maureen has new evidence.
- What evidence?

273
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:39,007
l put Carl on it.

274
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:43,512
He came up with a name. George Ferragamo.

275
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:48,811
That's the therapist Keith went to.
What about him?

276
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:53,279
- He claims that...
- Not that Keith confessed in therapy?

277
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:55,653
- Apparently.
- Well, then he's lying.

278
00:30:55,742 --> 00:31:00,867
- You've gotta get our lawyers on this.
- Yeah, l know. l will.

279
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:05,292
- But, you know...
- What is it, David?

280
00:31:07,754 --> 00:31:12,961
l just don't understand it.
Maureen's always been very responsible,

281
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:16,135
one of the few real professionals left.

282
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:18,712
Well, l'd call this unprofessional.

283
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:23,183
David!

284
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:28,809
David, you can't seriously think
that our son might be a killer?

285
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:34,271
No, of course not.

286
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:44,075
- Look, l apologised.
- You don't get it, do you?

287
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:47,415
- You've committed a serious crime.
- Officer, please.

288
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:50,171
Clearly he's upset. We both are.

289
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,006
lf you could just give us a break, please.

290
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:59,088
- (radio) 1-Mary-38.
- 1-Mary-38. Go.

291
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,471
1-Mary-38. That emergency call was placed at
that location approximately 30 minutes ago.

292
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,637
Copy. Thanks.

293
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:14,940
That still doesn't justify you
disobeying a police officer.

294
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,106
ldiot!

295
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:37,211
- Ground units'll be on their way.
- l need him now to claim jurisdiction.

296
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:40,753
- Where do you want me?
- Keep him pinned down at the exit.

297
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:43,801
l'll try and go round
the other side. Don't hit him.

298
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:47,308
- l won't.
- Don't hit me either.

299
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:17,375
(loudhailer) This is the police.
Drop your weapon.

300
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:31,304
¡Dios mío! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor!

301
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:34,315
- l told you to stay put!
- Yo no hice nada.

302
00:33:57,465 --> 00:33:59,541
(man) Over here!

303
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:04,296
- You want me, come and get me.
- (cop) Don't do it! He'll kill both of us!

304
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,259
(cop) Don't do it!

305
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,436
Come out! Drop the gun!

306
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,687
Don't!

307
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:19,643
Step out where l can see you
and throw down the gun.

308
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:21,446
(cop) Don't do it!

309
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,615
- l'll drop the gun, but you've gotta relax.
- Don't do it.

310
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,824
Shut up. Put down the gun.

311
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,618
Speak English, asshole!

312
00:34:30,707 --> 00:34:34,491
l'm putting down the gun!
The gun's going down.

313
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:45,168
Good work. Throw me your cuffs.

314
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:48,298
Oh, my God.

315
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:59,225
(Teri) l think it might be up here,
somewhere to the right.

316
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,813
(York) Yeah, maybe.

317
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:09,740
(York) There's someone up ahead. Maybe
they saw something. Roll down your window.

318
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:15,246
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what happened here, please?

319
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:19,249
- lt might involve our children.
- You shouldn't let your children come here.

320
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:22,957
Yeah, l know. But could you just
please tell me what happened?

321
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:26,135
Girl was hit by a car.

322
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:29,175
Do you know where they took her?

323
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:31,341
St Mark's is closest.

324
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:35,387
Was she alive?

325
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,683
- She didn't look good.
- Go, go, go, go.

326
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,616
(Dan) Hey, it's Gaines.

327
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:30,192
- Where's the other one?
- She was a problem, so we killed her.

328
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,992
- The body?
- No one'll find it.

329
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,448
- She been any trouble?
- Not at all.

330
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:52,973
You're with me now.

331
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:57,969
Be good, you'll be back at the mall
in a day or two. Be bad, you won't. Clear?

332
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,932
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

333
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:11,438
Agent Farrell, come with me, please.

334
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,252
Jamey.

335
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:25,124
l've already told these men,
l don't know anything.

336
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:29,509
Tryin' to protect Jack and Nina?
Don't be naive.

337
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:32,135
Sit.

338
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:38,095
Let me tell you how the game is played.

339
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:42,848
First thing they do is to tell you
that you're the only one they can trust.

340
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:47,603
That's flattering, and it makes
you trust them in return. All right?

341
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:50,815
Then they get you to do
something you shouldn't.

342
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:54,857
Say you don't know where
Jack went, for example.

343
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,739
The next thing you know, Jack's gone,

344
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:04,203
Nina's stonewalling,
and you're in the hot seat.

345
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,371
Sound familiar?

346
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:12,505
Hey, you're being used.
l've seen it a million times.

347
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:16,011
lf you help me out, l'll help you out.

348
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,138
lf you hold out...

349
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:24,308
(phone rings)

350
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:29,609
Mason.

351
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:32,697
Really? Good. l'm on my way.

352
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:38,192
Seems our boy's surfaced. His name
popped up on a police frequency.

353
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:41,408
- Not that l'm surprised.
- ls he in trouble?

354
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,879
Off the record, just out of curiosity,

355
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:52,540
what's so special about Jack Bauer?

356
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:59,756
All right, we've found Bauer.
We're pulling out. Lockdown's over.

357
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:03,350
Hope you give some thought
to what we talked about.

358
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,974
(man) Call it in as a DOA.

359
00:39:25,418 --> 00:39:29,001
Everything checked out. Here you go.

360
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:31,128
What was her name?

361
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:32,840
Jessie Hampton.

362
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:37,425
Know anything about this guy?

363
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:41,558
- No. l gotta take him in for questioning.
- Maybe you didn't notice, he killed a cop.

364
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:46,554
- But there's something else at stake here.
- Not to me. Not to these guys.

365
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,436
All right.

366
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:55,067
Can l at least have a few minutes with him?

367
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,907
Guys.

368
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:02,071
Thank you.

369
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:04,948
Get up.

370
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,666
lf you tell me who you are,
l might be able to help you.

371
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:13,455
- Don't let them take me. lf they do, l'm dead.
- They seem in control.

372
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,041
l'm not worried about them.

373
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:19,971
- Who are you worried about?
- You spring me, then l talk.

374
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:23,223
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's too bad...

375
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:25,053
Bauer.

376
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:27,517
Bauer. How do you know my name?

377
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,183
(cop) Time's up.

378
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:34,101
l know more than that. lf you ever wanna see
your daughter again, get me outta this.

379
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,942
What do you know about my daughter?!

380
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,948
l'm fine! l'm fine!

381
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,909
l'm fine.

382

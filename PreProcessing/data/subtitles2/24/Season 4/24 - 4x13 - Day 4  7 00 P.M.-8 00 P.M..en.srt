1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,330
Here are all the access codes for CTU and Division.

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,760
Thanks.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,430
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,930
If you need anything,you can always call me at home.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,260
Excuse me,sir.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,860
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,730
Tony,I want to thank you for filling in.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,520
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,520
Who?

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,380
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,190
I used to be married to her.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,540
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,560
Why there?

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,000
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,900
Need to get into their computer system?

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,550
Yeah.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay,I'll go with you.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,490
So how can I help CTU?

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,310
One of your employees,a Harris Barnes,

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,800
is actually Habib Marwan,

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,140
one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack

22
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,920
and the theft of the override device.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,940
We need you to take your I.T. systems off-line

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,630
so Paul can look into his directory.

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,640
CTU will subpoena those files.

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,710
They will find out the truth.

27
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,500
Damn it.

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,730
what you doing

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,640
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,790
Look at this.

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,570
,...

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
that's it.. Print it out,now! Now!

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,550
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.

34
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,110
The pulse bomb, we have to use it,now.

35
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,870
We're dealing with an EMP.

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,060
Once it goes off,everything

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,570
within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm going to try and stop it. If I don't,

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,070
I want you to take the hard copy

40
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,550
and try to meet me in the front of the building.

41
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,080
A CTU agent is heading down near you.

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,140
Don't let him anywhere near it!

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,460
Oh,my God.

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,540
the following takes place...

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,280
are any elect

46
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,100
only the...

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,870
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,890
Approximately,eight.

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,650
The southeast quadrant of downtown.

50
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,790
Okay,hold your position until the readings stabilize.

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,760
Any word from Jack or Paul?

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,490
No. Once the pulse bomb went off,

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,780
we lost all communication with them.

54
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,040
What was the last word we heard from them?

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,000
Well,Jack and Paul found something.

56
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,130
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,830
So that's why they set off the EMP,to destroy the evidence.

58
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,040
That'd be my guess.

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,100
That'd be my guess.

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,450
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action,

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,930
is evidence against them.

62
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,690
Yeah,but it's not proof.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,770
Curtis,could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,820
No,an EMP only damages electronics.

65
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,450
But it doesn't mean they're safe.

66
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,860
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.

67
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,650
Where is it?

68
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,240
It's up to you.

69
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,530
You decide when the pain stops.

70
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,230
Call me when he talks.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,280
no

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,060
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,090
I said drop it!

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,850
Paul?

75
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,750
Where's the data printout?

76
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,020
I hid it...

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,010
in an office down the hallway.

78
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,740
I know you're hurt,

79
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,990
but we've got to get it and get out of here. Let's go.

80
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,010
It's here.

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,980
Take a seat.

82
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,860
Where is it?

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,730
Bottom drawer, under some folders.

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,390
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,260
Is this it?

86
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,430
Yeah,it's in code.

87
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,070
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,890
We need to get it back to CTU.

89
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,740
I don't think I could have held out much longer.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,060
You did great.

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,010
Let's go.

92
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,400
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,090
She'll be taking over

94
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,180
as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,330
Tony,I appreciate you carrying the ball

96
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,660
until Michelle got here.

97
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,460
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?

98
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,050
Yes,sir.

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man

100
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,140
responsible for planning today's attacks,Habib Marwan,

101
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,850
has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster,

102
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,640
the third largest defense contractor in the country.

103
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,080
Now we know that Marwan's been using the alias Harris Barnes.

104
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,320
What we don't know yet,

105
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,350
is how he managed to evade their security checks.

106
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,320
Marwan knows we're looking for him,so he's probably gone dark.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
But his association with McLennan-Forster

108
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,740
has become our primary focus.

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,560
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company

110
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,110
to inspect his computer files.

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,260
But as they were doing so,

112
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,580
an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated,

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,770
wiping out the company's entire database.

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,520
It also fried every electrical device

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,910
within an eight-mile radius.

116
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,340
Streetlights,computers,cars, cell phones,everything.

117
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,850
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?

118
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,560
Yes,but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,060
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,080
thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.

121
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,970
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?

122
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,370
Not yet. Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided,

123
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,270
we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,450
The only problem is,until we find Jack and Paul,

125
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,830
they're not going to be able to do much.

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900
We want to do everything we can

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,850
to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines.

128
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,390
But the priority is to retrieve any information

129
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,230
they found at McLennan-Forster.

130
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,470
That's all.

131
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,590
Tony?

132
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,580
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.

133
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,670
Thank you.

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,970
Division is sending over a supplemental list

135
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,040
of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.

136
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,670
I want you to check any names

137
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,210
that have been flagged by other agencies,including overseas.

138
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,150
Given what's happening right now,

139
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,750
it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.

140
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,220
It has to be done.

141
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,840
And I'd like youto do it.

142
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,290
Michelle,Jack and Paul

143
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,760
have information that could be vital

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,770
in helping us end this crisis.

145
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,270
I should be helping us find them.

146
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,850
Michelle...

147
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,780
The last time I saw you,

148
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,330
you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.

149
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,800
That was six months ago.

150
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,920
This is what I need you to do.

151
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,130
If you don't like it, you can resign.

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,810
I'm gonna need a security clearance.

153
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,320
I'll make sure you get a level three.

154
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
A level three?

155
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,160
I used to have a six.

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,990
Right now,all you need is three.

157
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,440
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Not at all.

159
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,600
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflictson the job.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,030
I know your history.

161
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,310
I know that you guys were married

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,400
and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.

163
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,440
But if this is going to be a problem...

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,140
His being here will not affect my work.

165
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,900
I won't let it.

166
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,110
Now,if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it,

167
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,630
I'll be more than glad to.

168
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,630
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD,

169
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,810
indicating that there is widespread looting going on

170
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,340
in the blacked out zone.

171
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,630
A number of cars have been set on fire,

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,000
stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.

173
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,450
There may even be casualties.

174
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,260
We just don't know at this time.

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,100
Shots were heard? That could be

176
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,360
the same people that are after Jack. I don't get it.

177
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,530
What information could Jack have found

178
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,050
that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?

179
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,460
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.

180
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,300
Anything they're doing now is insignificant

181
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,520
if there's proof that they helped Marwanwith today's attacks.

182
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,630
This is Anderson.

183
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,430
It is time for you to go.

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,070
Marwan,your face is all over the news.

185
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,780
Don't worry about it.

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,600
Things will proceed as planned.

187
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,550
Are you ready?

188
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes,of course.

189
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,060
How long will it take you to get there?

190
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,890
Less than 30 minutes.

191
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll inform the others.

192
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,970
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster,

193
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,970
and it's not responding to any of our ID requests.

194
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,490
You sure?

195
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah,I'm positive.

196
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,670
Michelle.

197
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,740
exuse me

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,300
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone,

199
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,490
not one of ours.

200
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,850
Police?

201
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,300
No. Not one of theirs either,I checked.

202
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,860
A chopper that size carries 20 menfully armed.

203
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,280
Who would have sent it?

204
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,110
Whoever set off the EMP.

205
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,480
They're going in after Jack and Paul.

206
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,160
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.

207
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,630
Contact our field teams in the air.

208
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,320
Let them know about the intruding chopper.

209
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,750
Jack,I can't do this.

210
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,950
Don't have a choice. Come on.

211
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,420
You got it.

212
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,780
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.

213
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,810
Let's move!

214
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,710
Come on,this way.

215
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,420
This way.

216
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,000
Where do we go now?

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,260
Weapons and ammunition.

218
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,760
Get away from me! Get down!

219
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,620
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!

220
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm a federal agent.

221
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,020
Yeah,sure you are!

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,100
Get away from here!

223
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,200
Look,we need your help!

224
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,600
go! now!

225
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,720
Okay,just relax.

226
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,880
I'm leaving!

227
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,590
Okay,I'm leaving.

228
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,990
Drop the weapon. Now!

229
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,110
Kick the gun over to me.

230
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,970
Paul!

231
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,560
Get in here.

232
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,450
Pick up that gun.

233
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,390
My name is Jack Bauer.

234
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,050
I am a federal agent.

235
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,490
Well,you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.

236
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,600
You still have any rifles or they get them,too?

237
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,220
Behind the counter

238
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,040
Show me.

239
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,770
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're Arab Americans.

240
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,240
And we're good citizens.

241
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,710
We had nothing to do with what happened today!

242
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,960
Be quiet,Safah. He doesn't care.

243
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,940
take what you need, but leave us two guns.

244
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,600
We've chased the looters off once,but they'll be back.

245
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,390
Just stay there.

246
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,090
Give me the keys.

247
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,720
What are you guys doing here?

248
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,260
We needed to take cover.

249
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,570
What do you mean?

250
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,850
Who's after you?

251
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,950
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

252
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,020
I have critical evidence that I need to get

253
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,340
to the authorities.

254
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,340
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.

255
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,380
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.

256
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,580
It destroys all electrical activity

257
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,160
within an eight-mile radius.

258
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,310
So everything that's happened to us tonight- the looting,

259
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,330
the blackout- it's all because of the terrorists?

260
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,580
Yes,and the evidence that I have

261
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,710
can help prevent further attacks from happening.

262
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,520
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.

263
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Commandos?

264
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,590
He's right.

265
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,660
You both need to leave this store.

266
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,540
Right now,we're their target.

267
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,780
You're not safe here with us.

268
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,730
Why don't you leave? This is our store.

269
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,410
If I had a choice,I would!

270
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,290
You have weapons and shelter.

271
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,070
Right now,there is no other place for us to be.

272
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,040
Can I talk to my brother for a second?

273
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,830
Stay where I can see you.

274
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,300
What's the plan?

275
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,510
CTU knows we're in trouble.

276
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,150
They also know we can't contact them.

277
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,590
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.

278
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,440
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived

279
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,980
in a military helicopter.

280
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,370
CTU had to see that on satellite.

281
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,250
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight,

282
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,010
we can force their commandos to use radio frequency

283
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,550
to communicate their positions.

284
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,360
And CTU will pick up the signal?

285
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,580
yes

286
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,260
So you want to engage

287
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,450
the McLennan-Forster army,

288
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,710
just the two of us?

289
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,430
We have a positional advantage,

290
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,810
and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.

291
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,660
My brother and I talked about this.

292
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,500
We're staying.

293
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,670
I can't force you to leave your own property.

294
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,030
But this is not just a bunch of looters.

295
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,970
This is a very dangerous situation.

296
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,080
You don't understand.

297
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,180
For years,we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.

298
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,000
We grew up in this neighborhood.

299
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,050
This country is our home.

300
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,790
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed,

301
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,460
then we'll help you.

302
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,860
I agree. The President should stay in the air

303
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,100
at least another hour, if not longer.

304
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,680
If he wants to speak to the nation,

305
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,690
he should do it from Air Force One.

306
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,110
Keep me informed.

307
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,500
I have an update on the damage

308
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,430
from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.

309
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,950
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.

310
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,940
How are you doing?

311
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,110
sit down

312
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,260
Any word from Jack or Paul?

313
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
no

314
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,470
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.

315
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,650
There's something else, isn't there?

316
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,250
A couple of hours ago,

317
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,450
when we thought that Paulwas somehow involved with the attacks,

318
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,350
Jack questioned him.

319
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,640
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted,but...

320
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,020
Jack was pretty rough?

321
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,220
Very.

322
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,740
That's his job.

323
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,220
He had to make sure.

324
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,520
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.

325
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,470
I know,I guess it was just a shock to see it.

326
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,380
Somehow he seemed like a different person.

327
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,750
We need people like that, Audrey.

328
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,740
Jack is an incredible man. Just...

329
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,900
But you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before,is that it?

330
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,230
Something like that.

331
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,550
Could I speak to you for a moment?

332
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,740
It's important.

333
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,230
Okay. Um...

334
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,440
I don't have much time.

335
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,820
You're aware I was falsely accused

336
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,610
of leaking information earlier today.

337
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,390
I need people whose minds are on their jobs. Yours isn't.

338
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,020
Is the back entrance locked?

339
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,500
Yeah.

340
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,420
Okay.

341
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,400
Put one of these in each window.

342
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,820
Have extra ammunition standing by.

343
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,650
Then I want you to get two hunting vests,

344
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,370
fill all the pockets with empty clips. Go.

345
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,550
Ms. Gavin won't be workingwith us anymore.

346
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,680
...her workload.

347
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,900
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.

348
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,980
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already

349
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
or not qualified to replace her.

350
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,070
You may want to reconsider.

351
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,610
No,I don't trust her.

352
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,520
yeah

353
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,460
You'll be working with Agent Stiles

354
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,810
and Manning for the rest of the day.

355
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,040
Edgar,I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.

356
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,850
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.

357
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,360
okay

358
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,210
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.

359
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,380
Give me an update first.

360
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,110
The zone is still pretty quiet,except for emergency vehicle chatter.

361
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,920
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.

362
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,830
CTU's tact teams are standing by.

363
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:48,950
But the best we can do

364
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,470
is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.

365
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.

366
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,260
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?

367
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,940
It's the most efficient way to be found.

368
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,970
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong,

369
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,030
Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.

370
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,650
If we cover the perimeter,

371
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,090
we may have a chance to save them.

372
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,790
Do it.

373
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,330
There's one of them.

374
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,430
It's time.

375
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,490
No one fires until I give the order.

376
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,220
ok

377
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,880
Team leader,this is Specter.

378
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,240
I was just shot at.

379
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,950
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,between Flower and Third.

380
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,890
Audrey?

381
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,440
yes?

382
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,110
Could you let DOD know that we've piggybacked

383
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,810
onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?

384
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,520
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.

385
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,910
So you don't need them any more? -No.

386
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,230
All right,no problem.

387
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,990
Um,look,I didn't mean to be confrontational before.

388
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,830
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm,

389
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,050
you have to be decisive.

390
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,990
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony.

391
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,290
Why's that?

392
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,870
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.

393
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,560
And he went to the one person that he knew

394
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,190
would come through for him and that was Tony.

395
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Tony saved our lives.

396
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,560
I didn't know that.

397
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,220
After that,we just spent a couple hours with him.

398
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,210
It's true,Tony does have a lot of issues,

399
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,000
but he is good at what he does,

400
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,010
and I think that we could use him on a day like today.

401
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Thanks.

402
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,700
Tony,look,I just want you to know that...

403
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,930
just because I overruled you a few minutes ago

404
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,210
doesn't mean that I don't value your input.

405
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,300
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.

406
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,740
Good.

407
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,510
guys

408
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,600
You sure you both want to do this?

409
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,530
Yeah.

410
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,060
My brother and I,

411
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,150
we're more angry about these attacks

412
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,110
today than you are.

413
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,200
But if he were here right now,

414
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,720
he'd be standing next to you just as we are.

415
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,890
Just stay low and do what I tell you.

416
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,270
Thank you...

417
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,380
for saving my life.

418
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,030
yeah

419
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,480
They're here.

420
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,350
Tony,Michelle just said that you were doing a search

421
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,300
on possible ties to Marwan. May I help?

422
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,540
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?

423
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,410
In Washington?

424
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,790
Yeah,it would save me time

425
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,180
if I could use it on this search.

426
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,710
Yeah.

427
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,200
There you go.

428
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,390
Thanks.

429
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,410
Anything else?

430
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,540
It should kick off a few names. You can help me

431
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,010
run them down once it's done searching.

432
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,900
Okay,great.

433
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,270
So,um...

434
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,090
did you tell Michelle what happened today?

435
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,400
I said that Jack called you.

436
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,530
Anything else?

437
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,800
Well,I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.

438
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,980
She probably already knows that

439
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,530
A lot different than Washington.

440
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,300
Yeah,it is different.

441
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,080
Are you talking about Jack...

442
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
or yourself?

443
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,510
I think we found them!

444
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,140
See those signals underground?

445
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,030
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.

446
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,440
That's because they're planning an attack.

447
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,610
They converged on a location on Flower and Third,

448
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,360
about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.

449
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,540
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.

450
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,800
Sporting goods store, across the street.

451
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,970
Let's move.

452
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,080
Bravo One,move in.

453
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,450
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire

454
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,760
at the site of the radio transmission.

455
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,610
How much longer before our teams get there?

456
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,320
The ground teams are closest. They'll get there first.

457
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,990
When?

458
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,690
At least five or six minutes.

459
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,040
Who's helping him?

460
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,050
I don't know.

461
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,930
They've got to be civilians.

462
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,800
We need to end this quickly and get that document.

463
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,200
Is that understood?

464
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,060
Yeah. I understand.

465
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,320
Let's go.

466
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,480
Raji!

467
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,580
Hey,Raji!

468
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,990
You okay? Raji?

469
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,790
Fall back!

470
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,100
Okay,because of

471
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
the night vision goggles, if they get within ten feet of you,

472
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,920
shine your flashlight in their eyes,it'll blind them.

473
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,210
ok

474
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,000
Jack!

475
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,560
Jack!

476
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,590
The gunfire stopped.

477
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,910
The teams on site?

478
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,640
Not yet.

479
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,950
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.

480
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,520
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.

481
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,600
Get in touch with the teams.

482
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,460
I'll update Division.

483
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,080
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight,

484
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,700
what about Jack and Paul?

485
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,310
there is no way to tell

486
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,380
CTU personnel are approaching the location.

487
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,030
CTU,this is Castle, we're about to engage.

488
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,110
How many hostiles have been sighted?

489
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,790
Six down outside,unknown number inside.

490
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,270
Lee,it's Tony.

491
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,820
Are Jack and Paul still alive?

492
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,380
Unknown at this point.

493
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,440
All right,look,the hostiles cannot be allowed

494
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,960
to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.

495
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,590
Do you understand?

496
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,810
We'll do the best we can.

497
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,060
No,Lee,listen to me.

498
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,920
Failure is not an option.

499
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,170
That information is what this whole thing is about.

500
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,590
Roger that.

501
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,170
Jack!

502
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,040
Yeah? I'm here!

503
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,490
You and Raines safe? -Yeah.

504
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,490
All hostiles are down. We're clear.

505
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,270
Copy.

506
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:57,990
Yeah,Dan.

507
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
No,no,my people will take care of that

508
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,420
when we sift through the data.

509
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,910
Yeah.

510
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,200
Okay.

511
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,780
Jack and Paul are okay.

512
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,780
What about the information?

513
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,250
We don't know if Jack has it yet.

514
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,070
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going

515
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,580
to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.

516
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,350
Well,we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.

517
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,500
That should yield some leads.

518
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,140
Well,it's going to have to be worked up here,

519
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,150
because McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.

520
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,530
You want to head that up?

521
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,170
all right

522
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,150
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.

523
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,950
I need you to get this to CTU.

524
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,860
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?

525
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,240
Jack! Look out!

526
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,340
Paul?

527
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,660
Paul? Paul?

528
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,640
Medic!

529
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,510
Come on,stay with me.

530
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,650
Come on,Paul. Stay with me.

531
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,650
No,no,Paul.

532
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,710
Paul,stay with me. Come on,look at me.

533
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,810
Look at me. There you go.

534
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,660
Look at me.

535
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,910
I owed you.

536
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,360
You don't owe me anything. Just stay with me,okay

537
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,490
Jack,let the medic do the work.

538
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,820
Any problems?

539
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,510
What about you?

540
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,510
I'm leaving now.

541
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,860
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.

542
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,320
We can't be late.

543

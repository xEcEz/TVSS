00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,279
Previously On 24

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,045
I want Bauer arrested.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,625
Bauer is heading the field operation.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,900
Jack Bauer is not the only
man who can do the job!

9
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,267
Put someone else in charge!

10
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:21,600
Jack, we've got a problem.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,360
Secret service is on their way
over there now to arrest you.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,100
Bill, they can't interrupt this mission.

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,330
You got to stall 'em.

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,555
There's nothing I can do from here.

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,040
You have to get Marean before
secret service gets there.

16
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,490
People of america, you wake
up today to a different world.

17
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:38,000
I have a visual on Marean.
He is in the building.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,435
Damn it. They know we're here.

19
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,550
Everybody move on the doors.

20
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:42,205
Our cover's blown!

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,170
Everyone go, go, go, go, go!

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,560
President Logan realized this was a mistake.

23
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:52,430
You're free to go.

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,310
We had Marean.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,680
Damn it! We had him!

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,140
This man Marean has a nuclear warhead,

27
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:03,570
and I allowed him to escape.

28
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,100
Mr. President...

29
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:04,965
Stop!

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,300
I don't even know if I
deserve to be called that.

31
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,930
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,490
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,177
President Logan is requesting you
run the effort to recover the stolen

34
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,110
weapon and be in place to make
whatever decisions need to be made.

35
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,895
Is it compatible?

36
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,030
I'll need to reconfigure
the trigger mechanism.

37
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,710
Has the warhead been reconfigured?

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,820
Yes, we, uh... may have a
potential security breach here.

39
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:32,825
Who?

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,515
The technician, sabir.

41
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,920
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,830
I think sabir may have become
involved with radical groups.

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,620
You mean terrorists?

44
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:43,165
Yes.

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,185
The woman with the phone tip who was
suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.

46
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,590
She sent us a schematic
of a microchip that was

47
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,960
used exclusively in the
legacy nuclear warhead.

48
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:51,722
Take a team with you.

49
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:52,450
Let's get on this.

50
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,850
what was that?

51
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,210
he's going to ram us!

52
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,811
The following takes place
between 2:00 A.M. and 3:00 A.M.

53
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,910
It's good to have you back, Mr. President.

54
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:30,720
Thank you, aaron.

55
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,280
This way, sir.

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,790
President Logan's not
working out of the west wing?

57
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:35,835
No, sir.

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,060
Since the strike on air force one,

59
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,440
he's been in the bunker.

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,850
How's your son?

61
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:45,765
Very well, sir.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,275
Thank you for asking.

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,035
Still in the service?

64
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,760
Yes. In fact, he, uh,

65
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,752
just re-upped.

66
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:52,710
Good for him.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,120
We're mighty proud.

68
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,325
Mr. President, thank you for coming.

69
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,190
Mike. Is there an update on
president Keeler's condition?

70
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,695
No, he's still comatose.

71
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,950
And the long
- term prognosis is still unclear?

72
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:11,570
Yes.

73
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,205
How's president Logan?

74
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,490
Looking forward to seeing you.

75
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,480
Thank you, aaron.

76
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,600
President Logan.

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,460
David.

78
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,900
I appreciate you coming so quickly.

79
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,490
Tell me how I can help you.

80
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,140
David... I wasn't prepared to have
all of this thrust upon me so suddenly.

81
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,750
What I'm trying to say
is I-I made mistakes.

82
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,836
This crisis could've ended an hour
ago if I hadn't interfered with

83
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:46,450
a CTU operation that would've...
would've captured Habib Marean.

84
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:49,657
Punishing yourself for a mistake is
something you can't afford right now.

85
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,830
What I can't afford and what this
country can't afford is another mistake.

86
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,030
Every decision I make affects the
lives of millions of americans.

87
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,630
I understand the pressure you're under.

88
00:03:58,665 --> 00:03:59,425
I know you do.

89
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,330
When you were in office, you dealt with
this kind of situation more than once.

90
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:05,120
That's why i want you here.

91
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,720
I still don't understand what
it is I can do to help you.

92
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:10,870
Sit.

93
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,865
The warhead that was stolen is an s-series.

94
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,630
That's one of the most powerful
nuclear weapons in the arsenal.

95
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,125
Wherever it's detonated,

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,460
it will wreak... unthinkable devastation.

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
Help me find it.

98
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,770
I will give you full authority to act as
my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.

99
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,440
Charles, how do you want this to work?

100
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,960
I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU,
and I'll let him know that...

101
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,950
he'll be dealing directly with you.

102
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,760
All right.

103
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,710
Thank you, david.

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,620
Mike'll fill you in.

105
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,270
We will get through this, Mr. President.

106
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,016
Um, I'll be, uh, in
conference room b working

107
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:15,890
on the morning statement for the press.

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,380
I'll keep you apprised
of any developments, sir.

109
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,730
Thank you, mike.

110
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,210
Mr. President...

111
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,517
I know you believe my
actions during your term in

112
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:41,150
office amounted to a personal
and political betrayal...

113
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:42,780
it's not something I believe.

114
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,525
It's a fact.

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,665
Get to your point.

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,750
If my presence here makes
it more difficult for you,

117
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,500
say the word, and I'll leave.

118
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,730
Mike... you're wired
into this administration,

119
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,090
and I have no doubt that you have
this country's best interests at heart,

120
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,890
so for now, let's let bygones
be bygones and get to work.

121
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,180
Thank you, Mr. President.

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,560
I appreciate that.

123
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,095
I reviewed the briefing
materials on the way here.

124
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,430
Have army reserve supplement the search
teams looking for the warhead in iowa

125
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,400
and have D.O.E. And D.O.D. Coordinating
on crisis response in case it's detonated.

126
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,145
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,615
CTU is heading up the search for this
man who stole the warhead, Habib Marean?

128
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,050
Yes. They recovered a damaged videotape
from Marean's last known location.

129
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,115
They're in the process of restoring it.

130
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,060
But Marean is not CTU's
only lead on the warhead now.

131
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:46,345
What else do we have?

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,279
A CTU analyst named Chloe
o'brian secured a hard

133
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,060
drive belonging to one
of Marean's associates.

134
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,890
This hard drive may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

135
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,165
I told you I'm not hurt.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,880
I did the shooting. Now please
leave me alone so I can do this.

137
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,055
Okay. The hard drive is unlocked.

138
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,920
Chloe, the hard drive
belonged to someone who

139
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,870
had no previous experience
with nuclear weapons.

140
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:13,925
He had to get that information from someone.

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,345
The emails I'm decrypting
look like exactly that:

142
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,000
Weapons schematics, designs of nuclear
triggers- all from the same person.

143
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:20,745
Who?

144
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,680
The e-mail address itself is
shielded under a false domain name.

145
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,810
What is it?

146
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,880
Mem4xp.

147
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,610
Okay. Chloe, I want you to
forward all the emails to us.

148
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:29,072
Edgar?

149
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:30,485
I'll run a trace to
find the point of origin.

150
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,060
These emails came from a domestic server.
Whoever sent this is in this country.

151
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,990
Okay, Chloe, thank you.

152
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:36,960
Hold on.

153
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,430
Hey. How you holding up?

154
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,890
I'm not used to the idea that I just killed
someone, if that's what you're asking,

155
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,060
but I'm doing my job.

156
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,135
Fair enough.

157
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,250
Get back as soon as you can, okay?

158
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,150
Okay.

159
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,485
I got a hit.

160
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,670
The man who sent the
emails name is lee jong.

161
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,007
Is he in our database?

162
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,275
He's a chinese national:

163
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,205
A research scientist who worked on
china's nuclear weapon's program.

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,115
He was accused of falsifying research
data and fired by their government in 2001.

165
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,934
Is it possible china's providing
Marean with support for this attack?

166
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,000
No, the chinese wouldn't use someone that
could be traced back to them so easily.

167
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,615
He's selling his services
as a freelance operator.

168
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,310
If lee's helping Marean
reconfigure or redeploy the warhead,

169
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,310
most likely he'll know how to find it.

170
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:17,195
Check with the I.N.S.,

171
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,060
See if lee's entered the
country in the last week.

172
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,380
Excuse me.

173
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,030
This is Bauer.

174
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,265
Jack, dr. Besson.

175
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,195
You wanted me to give you
an update on Paul Raines.

176
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,090
He's still in recovery,
but you can see him now.

177
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,100
Just limit your visit to a few minutes.

178
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,600
Thank you, doctor.

179
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,380
Get back to me if you find anything.

180
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,197
Where can I find you?

181
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:33,980
I'll be in medical.

182
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,375
Okay.

183
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah, I understand.

184
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,680
Hey.

185
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,670
Dr. Besson wants to move you to
amherst general's spinal program,

186
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,210
but the faa still has a ban on air travel.

187
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,210
I am trying to get you an exemption.

188
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,120
Well, if anyone can get
an exemption... you can.

189
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,575
Listen... I've thought a lot about this,

190
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,810
and... I want to go with
you to massachusetts.

191
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
"With me"?

192
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,565
Yeah.

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,740
You need to get better, and you
shouldn't have to do that alone.

194
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,375
No, I can take care of myself.

195
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,070
I don't need your charity.

196
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,730
It's not about charity, Paul.

197
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,310
It's what I want to do.

198
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,500
What about Jack?

199
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,250
You said you were in love with him.

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,790
I know.

201
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,230
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

202
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,695
I'll come back later.

203
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,760
No, it's all right.

204
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,150
Come in.

205
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,020
Thought you'd be at the dod briefing.

206
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,380
Yeah, it ended early.

207
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,705
Oh. I just wanted to come
down and see how you're doing.

208
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,140
I've been trying to get down
here since you got out of surgery.

209
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,145
Listen, Paul...

210
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,200
please, you don't have to say anything.

211
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,110
Yeah, I do.

212
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,285
You saved my life.

213
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,430
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,

214
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:11,305
so... you pushed me out of the way.

215
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,050
Honestly, I wasn't even
thinking. It just happened...

216
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,710
Paul? You all right?

217
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,610
I'll check back on you later.

218
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,620
Does he know that you want to come with me?

219
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,470
Not yet.

220
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,195
What is it?

221
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,160
We found lee jong.

222
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:43,785
Where is he?

223
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,085
Chinese consulate.

224
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,860
Damn it, he must have known
we were coming for him.

225
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:47,715
He took refuge.

226
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,345
He got there about an hour ago.

227
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,905
Consulate's sovereign territory.

228
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,430
It's the one place we can't get to him.

229
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,310
But we're going to try.

230
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,050
David palmer for you.

231
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,285
David palmer?

232
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,070
Frankly, president Logan's been a little
overwhelmed by what's been happening.

233
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:02,010
He enlisted palmer to help us directly.

234
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,180
Good.

235
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,115
This is Bauer.

236
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,640
Hold for the president.

237
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,345
Sir.

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,620
Thank you, mike.

239
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,695
It's nice to talk to you again, Jack.

240
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,640
It's nice to talk to
you, too, Mr. President.

241
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,980
L assume Bill told you about lee jong.

242
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:17,915
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,315
I'm about to call the chinese
consul and explain the situation.

244
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,934
I'd like it if you personally
took lee into custody

245
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,270
and brought him back to
CTU for interrogation.

246
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:28,080
And you think the consul
will be cooperative?

247
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,325
He's a reasonable man.

248
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,255
And what if the political
approach doesn't work?

249
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,620
I'll leave it to you to make
the necessary preparations.

250
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:37,940
Whatever it takes, we need
this man lee in custody.

251
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,120
I understand, Mr. President.

252
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:41,230
Thank you, Jack.

253
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,810
You have a chinese interpreter?

254
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,140
Melissa rabb. She's very good.

255
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,455
Okay, I need her,

256
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,400
curtis and one of his agents,ready
to move on the consulate now.

257
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,510
Edgar stiles.

258
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,140
Okay, I'm opening a window
now, send it through.

259
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,895
Ms. Dessler.

260
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,105
Division just called.

261
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,818
That videotape they
were trying to restore-

262
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,570
they were only able to
reconstruct part of it.

263
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,610
They're sending it to my
work station as we speak.

264
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,110
Bill.

265
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,460
People of america, you wake
up today to a different world.

266
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,010
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

267
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,330
It'll be days and weeks before you
can measure the damage we have caused.

268
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:24,717
But as you count your dead, remember...

269
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,060
you wake up today to a different world.

270
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,575
Do we take that literally?

271
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,670
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn?

272
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,310
We have to look at the worse case scenario.

273
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:36,282
What time is sunrise on the east coast?

274
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:39,220
7:02. Less than two hours from now.

275
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,540
Unless you renounce your policies of
imperialism and interventionist activities

276
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:51,640
this attack will be followed by
another and another after that.

277
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,810
The chinese consul in los
angeles, a man named koo yin.

278
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,625
Mr. Koo, this is david palmer.

279
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,070
It's an honor to speak
with you, Mr. President.

280
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,535
I'm calling on behalf of president Logan.

281
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,133
The situation today has forced him to direct

282
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:21,930
his attention to
other,equally urgent matters.

283
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,215
I understand.

284
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,010
And my government extends its sympathy
for these terrible attacks on your country.

285
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,240
We stand ready to help in any way we can.

286
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,225
Thank you.

287
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,035
The fact is, you can help us.

288
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,020
There's a man in your consulate
by the name of lee jong.

289
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,115
Yes, he arrived here earlier tonight.

290
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,150
We have evidence connecting him to
the terrorists behind today's attacks.

291
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:49,290
We need to take Mr. Lee into
custody immediately for questioning.

292
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,155
Mr. Lee expected suspicion to fall on him.

293
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,065
He says there's been a mistake, he
has no connections with terrorists.

294
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,140
We believe he's helping the terrorists
detonate a nuclear device on our soil.

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,550
Many lives are at stake, Mr. Koo.

296
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,630
President palmer

297
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,375
I would very much like to help,

298
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,610
but Mr. Lee is a chinese citizen and
the consulate is chinese territory.

299
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:13,915
I can't just hand him over to you
without going through channels.

300
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,740
Then I urge you to contact the premier
immediately and explain the situation.

301
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,205
Tell him speed is of the essence.

302
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,995
Tell him cooperation will be regarded as an

303
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,840
extraordinary act of friendship
on the part of his nation,

304
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,640
and our nation will respond in kind.

305
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,715
Mr. President, I'll do my best.

306
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,530
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

307
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,150
Thank you, Mr. Koo.

308
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,870
Consul's going to try
to make something happen.

309
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,870
How long will it take?

310
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,940
I don't know.

311
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,010
Anything new?

312
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,507
Yeah, white house just authorized adding

313
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,960
iowa army reserve units
to the ground search.

314
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,245
Have they widened the perimeter?

315
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,754
Yeah, they locked down a 60-mile radius

316
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,530
around the area where
the warhead was stolen,

317
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,780
but I'm concerned Marean's people might have
managed to sneak it outside that perimeter.

318
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,580
Well, we closed all major roads
and air traffic immediately,

319
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,805
but there is a chance they got it through.

320
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,690
Homeland security's faxing over casualty
projections based on that possibility.

321
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,600
That's probably them right now.

322
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,020
Yeah, I'll get it.

323
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,925
CTU.

324
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Woman: I'm calling for Tony Almeida.

325
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:26,035
Who is this?

326
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,150
This is Michelle Dessler,
a colleague of his.

327
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,055
May I ask who's calling?

328
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,830
The woman he happens to be
living with. Is he there?

329
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,670
Yeah, hold on.

330
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,025
It's for you.

331
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,790
Who is it?

332
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,900
The woman you're living with

333
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,085
Jen.

334
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,190
I've been calling everyone we
know going crazy looking for you.

335
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:52,260
Then finally I thought maybe
Jack Bauer took you back there.

336
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:54,310
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

337
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:55,225
Yeah, I'm sorry,

338
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,210
I should have called earlier,
but I've been very busy.

339
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,270
Oh, really? Busy with Michelle Dessler?

340
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,210
I'm working, jen.

341
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,460
Oh, for CTU.

342
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,580
On a provisional basis, yeah.

343
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,130
I thought you hated that place.

344
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,280
Things have changed a little.

345
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,635
Yeah, I guess they have.

346
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,780
Look, jen, we can talk about this later.

347
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,735
Right now I got to go, all right?

348
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,440
Tony, what's your ex-wife doing there?

349
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,230
Jen, I'm sorry, but I got to go.

350
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,805
Michelle, um...

351
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,470
I'm sorry you had to find out like that.

352
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,070
It's really none of my business.

353
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,605
Yeah, it is.

354
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,850
I should have told you I was
living with somebody else.

355
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,160
I don't want to talk about this right now.

356
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,400
Yeah, well, I do. Listen to me.

357
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:47,588
When you left, everything fell apart
and jen happened to be there for me.

358
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,990
You don't have to make
excuses for your relationship.

359
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,590
I'm not making excuses.

360
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm just telling you how it is.

361
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,970
Do you love her?

362
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,270
No.

363
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,830
Ms. Dessler, the new protocols
from dod just came in.

364
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,560
Should I send them to your screen?

365
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,560
Send them to station 16.

366
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,730
Thank you, Edgar.

367
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,125
You okay?

368
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
I'm fine.

369
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,060
Is there anything I can do?

370
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,025
I said I'm fine.

371
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,170
I'm trying not to think about what happened.

372
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm going to process it later, okay?

373
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
Sure, fine.

374
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,540
Edgar, I appreciate your
concern, I really do.

375
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,967
It's just that when I shot that guy,

376
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,961
I thought I'd go all fetal position,

377
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,920
but the truth is I didn't feel anything.

378
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,270
At all. I hope I'm not
some kind of a psychopath.

379
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,000
Well, he was trying to kill you.

380
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:08,155
Yeah, but still.

381
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,285
Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing.

382
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,380
Maybe you'll freak out
about it in a few days.

383
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,440
I hope so.

384
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,460
Sir.

385
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,440
Sir. Bill Buchanan.

386
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,450
thank you.

387
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,480
Yes, Bill?

388
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,480
Mr. President, we've just seen
a tape recorded by Habib Marean.

389
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:31,340
On it, he says we'll be, quote
"waking up to a different world. "

390
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,795
We can't be sure what that means,

391
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,040
but it may indicate that the warhead will
be detonated before dawn on the east coast.

392
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,960
Thank you, Bill.

393
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,400
CTU thinks that the warhead
may be detonated before dawn.

394
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,260
Get me Mr. Koo.

395
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,775
This is koo yin.

396
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,760
Please hold for president palmer, sir.

397
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,075
Mr. Koo.

398
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,810
President palmer, I didn't expect
to hear from you quite so soon.

399
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,355
Has the premier been made
aware of the situation?

400
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,910
Yes, Mr. President, he's
considering it very carefully.

401
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,235
There's no time for that.

402
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,008
I've just learned that
the terrorists may detonate

403
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,370
a nuclear device within the next two hours.

404
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,030
Mr. Palmer, I understand
the urgency of the situation.

405
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,545
And without making any promises,

406
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,500
I have every expectation of
giving you a favorable answer.

407
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,475
When?

408
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,170
I know I'll be speaking with
him again in two to three hours.

409
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,355
I told you, that's not soon enough.

410
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,490
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
It's the best I can do.

411
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,630
Thank you, Mr. Koo, for your efforts.

412
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:38,852
Please keep me informed.

413
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,040
Of course, Mr. President.

414
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,210
he thinks Mr. Lee will be handed over
to us, but not before two or three hours.

415
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:53,740
Now, from their point of view, that's
moving very fast for something like this.

416
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,480
From ours- not
nearly fast enough.

417
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,590
what do we do?

418
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,105
this is Bauer.

419
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,715
Jack, are you at the consulate yet?

420
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,030
Yes, sir, we've taken up
position across the street.

421
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,560
Have they agreed to release lee?

422
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,885
Not quickly enough.

423
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,230
And I just learned that the nuclear
device may be set off at any moment.

424
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,450
Now, Jack, is there any doubt in your
mind that lee is working with Marean?

425
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:35,370
No, sir- the e-mails he
sent left no room for doubt.

426
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,370
Then we have to get lee out
now and find out what he knows.

427
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,195
Yes, sir.

428
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,210
No one connected with the government
can admit to knowing anything about this

429
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,760
ever. If you're caught, you'll be tried
in a chinese court under chinese law.

430
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,300
I understand.

431
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,735
Now, Jack, if it was anyone else,

432
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,810
I'd ask if you were sure about this.

433
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,850
With you, I already know the answer.

434
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,700
God bless you.

435
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,185
Good luck.

436
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,860
Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,360
We're on. We're going in to get him.

438
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,190
All right.

439
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,400
Almeida.

440
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,415
Tony, this is Jack.

441
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,335
I'm at the consulate.

442
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,060
I need you to get me real-time
infrared satellite coverage.

443
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:19,960
All right, I'm on it.

444
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,805
What's going on, Jack?

445
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
The consul's not going
to release lee in time.

446
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:24,510
We have to go in and get him.

447
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,435
Who knows about this?

448
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,590
We have authorization from the white house.

449
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,545
Tony, this is a covert operation.

450
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,645
You're the only person at CTU who can know.

451
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,896
I need you to spoof the
satellite logs and make sure

452
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:38,070
that the mainframes aren't
monitoring your station.

453
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,450
Tony, there can't be any record that
this ever took place, you understand?

454
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:42,175
Yeah.

455
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,530
Okay, thanks.

456
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,230
Let's suit up.

457
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,970
Tony, it's Jack.

458
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:02,115
I'm on com.

459
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,340
All right, Jack, I'm uploading a
picture of lee to you right now.

460
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,550
Also, I just got a hold
of the building schematic.

461
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,260
Can you overlay the infrared?

462
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,180
Coming now.

463
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,220
Looks like the bulk of the people are
on the first floor residential area,

464
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,510
most of them not moving, probably asleep.

465
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,090
Try the second floor offices.

466
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,330
Grabbing data on the second floor.

467
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,200
All right, we got people moving.

468
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,768
Okay, by the way they're gathering around

469
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,510
that third room, that's
probably where lee is.

470
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:30,635
I think you're right.

471
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,660
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving.

472
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,925
How do you want to deploy?

473
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,620
I want agent rabb to stay in the
van until I need her to translate.

474
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:38,790
You both can cover the perimeter.

475
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:39,870
I'm going in alone.

476
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:40,345
Jack...

477
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,855
my orders are to make this
mission completely deniable.

478
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,700
If I get caught, I have to be
able to say I was acting alone.

479
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,760
All right, what do you want us to do?

480
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,235
Stay here.

481
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,980
If I need you, you both can reengage
as soon as I leave the consulate,

482
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:57,690
but only on a covert basis- masks
on, non-lethal force, you understand?

483
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,850
We'll be here.

484
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,950
Tony, I'm going in. Any change on infrared?

485
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:05,885
Negative.

486
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,910
We'll continue monitoring in real time.

487
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,205
Alarm's a cambia model three.

488
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm jumping the relays at the door now.

489
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,970
Roger that.

490
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,480
All right, Jack, stop.

491
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,250
We have somebody approaching
from your west side.

492
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,940
I repeat, your west side.

493
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,490
Okay, he's moving away.

494
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,970
Give me the status on the other four guards.

495
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,210
Jack, you're right on top of them.

496
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,490
We have someone approaching
from your north side.

497
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,600
Okay, you're clear.

498
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,830
I've got him.

499
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:50,920
Roger that.

500
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,760
People moving toward you on both floors.

501
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm heading out. Hostiles
in pursuit. Bring up the van.

502
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,410
Go! Go! Go! Go!

503
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,420
let's go!

504
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,770
He's hit.

505
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,690
Pass me the medical bag.

506
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:11,580
Now!

507
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,795
We're in.

508
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,780
Go! Go!

509
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,825
Jack, give me a status.

510
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,455
We're away, lee's in custody.

511
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,940
He's been shot in the back, no exit wound.

512
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:29,017
How bad is it?

513
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,025
I can't tell yet.

514
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,210
The bleeding doesn't look too severe.

515
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:32,557
We're on our way to you.

516
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:34,011
We're about 15 minutes out.

517
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,430
I'll have medical ready.

518
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,605
he says not to touch him.

519
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,419
He doesn't want you to touch him.

520
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:42,370
Tell him I'm just trying to help him.

521
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:43,610
I need to check his wound.

522
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,035
hold him down!

523
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,100
Hold him down now!

524
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,080
We need to calm him down
so that I can talk to him.

525
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,185
Tell him we got medical
assistance waiting for him

526
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:03,980
and that this shot is only
to help him ease the pain.

527
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,650
Does he understand?

528
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:09,230
Yes

529
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,910
Mm-hmm.

530
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,780
That's great.

531
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,490
Thank you very much.

532
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,950
Hey, the faa's cleared us to leave
at 8:00 on a medical transport plane.

533
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:40,090
Dr. Besson's agreed to accompany us.

534
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,780
That's great news.

535
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,430
As soon as you settle in, I'll
start looking for an apartment.

536
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,270
I don't know what to say.

537
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,490
I'm going to get through this.

538
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,110
I know you will.

539
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,060
Raines.

540
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,220
Yeah.

541
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,550
Okay.

542
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,430
All right, so you're going to
take care of the transportation...

543
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,340
I got to call you back

544
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,840
Paul?

545
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,170
Paul, what is it?

546
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,905
Paul?

547
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,380
Dr. Besson!

548
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,860
Please, someone come quickly!

549
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,050
Okay, okay, it's okay.

550
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:31,880
He's right here.

551
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,880
10 milligrams vasopressin.

552
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,410
What's going on?

553
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,290
I can barely hear his heart.

554
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,480
We need to do an ultrasound, but all
signs point to a cardiac tamponade.

555
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:47,225
What does that mean?

556
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,255
The sac around his heart
is filling up with blood.

557
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,000
Drain off some of the fluid, but we
got to get him back in surgery now.

558
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,810
If we don't stop the bleeding, his
heart will not be able to function.

559
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
Get me the pericardiocentesis tray, now.

560
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,180
Okay...

561
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,430
...roll on his back.

562
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,870
there.

563
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,985
Tell him we know that he helped
Habib Marean with the missing warhead,

564
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,710
and now we need him to help us find Marean
and stop him before he can detonate it.

565
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:22,550
If he denies involvement, tell him
we can prove it with his e-mails.

566
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,245
he doesn't deny it.

567
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,980
He says he knows where Marean is, and he
will tell you if you agree to his terms.

568
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:38,740
What are they?

569
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,930
he says he went to the consulate seeking

570
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,060
protection from our
government as well as Marean.

571
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:57,810
He believes Marean wants to kill
him to prevent him from talking.

572
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,680
He wants our guarantee of protection.

573
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,765
Tell him if the information that he
provides us leads us to the warhead in time,

574
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,299
he will be immune from prosecution
in this country and I will

575
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,000
take him back to the chinese
consulate or wherever he wants to go.

576
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,212
he says this is acceptable, but he wants a

577
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,440
guarantee of this in
writing from the president.

578
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,932
Tell him I understand that
and I will get that for him.

579
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,390
I give him my word, but I
need the information now.

580
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,453
He says he must have this
guarantee before he will tell you.

581
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:37,320
No, that's not good enough.

582
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,170
this is bau... this is Bauer.

583
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,590
President palmer's on the line.

584
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,720
Put him through.

585
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,070
Jack, Buchanan told me you've got lee
jong in custody, and that he was wounded.

586
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,465
Yes, sir.

587
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,405
Is he talking?

588
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,630
He wants to help us, but he
won't till he has a written

589
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:54,780
guarantee that he won't be
prosecuted in this country.

590
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:57,980
We also have to provide safe travel
to a destination of his choosing.

591
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,215
This guarantee has to be
signed by the president.

592
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,120
Jack, CTU believes the detonation
of this warhead is imminent.

593
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,500
Can you force him to talk immediately?

594
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:07,895
I don't think so.

595
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,690
I think the fastest way to make
this happen- give him what he wants.

596
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:18,650
Okay. I'll get the guarantee from Logan
and have it waiting for you at CTU.

597
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:19,790
Thank you, sir.

598
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,315
What is it?

599
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,950
Su ming, the deputy chinese consul.

600
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,250
They didn't waste any time.

601
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:31,605
I can't blame them.

602
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,470
They have to know we're behind the attack.

603
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:34,440
What shall I tell him?

604
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,510
I'll take the call.

605
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,260
We have to start fencing
with them sooner or later.

606
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:41,850
Might as well be now.

607
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,020
Mr. Lee won't talk unless he has a
guarantee of immunity and safe transport.

608
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,500
Get that from Logan, will you?

609
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,980
Mr. Su. Yes.

610
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:06,740
¶÷

611
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,870
Is this president palmer?

612
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,515
Yes. Has the premier
responded to the consul's

613
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:13,890
request to have Mr. Lee turned over to us?

614
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,080
Mr. President... the consul is dead.

615
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,605
What?

616
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,618
He was shot when armed men broke into this

617
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,950
building and took Mr.
Lee with them by force.

618
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,074
I'm shocked and deeply
saddened. Please convey

619
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,640
that to your government on behalf of mine.

620
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:40,390
Mr. President... is it your position that
you have no knowledge of this operation?

621
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:44,560
That the timing of your call and this
abduction is entirely coincidental?

622
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,870
The consulate is a sovereign territory
of the people's republic of china.

623
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:52,695
I can't believe anyone connected
with this country had a hand in it.

624
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,030
I'm sure you understand the political
ramifications if you are incorrect.

625
00:33:57,065 --> 00:34:01,295
And I'm sure you understand the
ramifications of unproven accusations.

626
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,790
No accusations have been
made, Mr. President, but

627
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,180
I can assure you there
will be an investigation.

628
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,830
Your government will have
my complete cooperation.

629
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,480
Thank you, Mr. President.

630
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,320
I'm sure you'll be hearing
from us again... very soon.

631
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,312
President Logan will provide lee with a

632
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:44,840
written guarantee, as
long as it remains covert.

633
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,030
Sir? What's wrong?

634
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,580
Koo yin was killed in the
course of the abduction.

635
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,330
my god.

636
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,215
By one of our own people?

637
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,800
No. It must have been friendly
fire, but it really doesn't matter.

638
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,915
If they're able to find
proof that we were involved,

639
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,316
in the long run, the
repercussions will be as

640
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:16,940
serious as those we're
facing from the terrorists.

641
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,420
Tony.

642
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,070
I just heard that lee jong is on
his way here and he's been shot.

643
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:26,060
How did this happen?

644
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,960
The chinese weren't going to give lee up in

645
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,270
time, so Jack and his
team had to extract him.

646
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:34,050
Jack went into the
consulate? On whose authority?

647
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,160
The white house.

648
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,560
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

649
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,960
This operation needed to be kept off
the books to make it was deniable.

650
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,825
But you knew about it.

651
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,740
Yes, I did. I ran tactical from here.

652
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,390
It is absolutely unacceptable. I
was kept out of the loop on this.

653
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,950
That's the way Jack wanted to play it.

654
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:05,960
You don't work for Jack! You work for me!

655
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,650
A situation, frankly, I wish I had
been consulted on in the first place.

656
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,075
Meaning?

657
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,460
Meaning, I thought it was a mistake to
reinstate you, and now I'm certain of it.

658
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,110
Look, I understand you don't
appreciate being kept in the dark...

659
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,160
but I think this is about something else.

660
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,430
Well, you're wrong about that,
too, and you are way out of line!

661
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,840
Thank you.

662
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,275
Tell him we're almost there.

663
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,930
The medical assistance that we promised
him and the guarantee are waiting for him.

664
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,980
I can't understand him.

665
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,770
Ask him if he's in pain.

666
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,390
He says he's cold, very cold.

667
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,090
What's going on, Jack?

668
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,820
He must have severe internal bleeding.

669
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,540
Damn it. His lungs are
filling up with fluid.

670
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,982
I'll alert CTU.

671
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,355
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee.

672
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,225
Tell me where Habib Marean is.

673
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,060
Please, tell me where he is now.

674
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,250
Damn it, we're losing him.

675
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,080
All right, stand by with a gurney.

676
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,740
We're coming in hot.

677
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:08,820
Jack

678
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,940
Jack, what's going on?

679
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Jack

680
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,780
You can't come in here.

681
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:15,415
He's dying.

682
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,865
So is he. Get out of here.

683
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,245
I just started this operation.

684
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,630
This man is our only connection
to a stolen nuclear warhead.

685
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,435
You've got to save him now.

686
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,690
I'll get to him as soon as I can.

687
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:24,012
He's not gonna make it.

688
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,300
I already have a patient.

689
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,180
Curtis.

690
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,700
You have a new one.

691
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:31,795
Are you crazy?

692
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,205
Maybe you didn't understand me.

693
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,105
This is the only man
that can help us find the

694
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,090
missing warhead and stop
it from being detonated.

695
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,540
If you don't save him,
millions of people will die.

696
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,980
Do you understand that? Millions of people.

697
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,600
Start working on him now!

698
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,615
Jack, what are you doing?

699
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,950
If I walk away from Mr.
Raines now, he will die.

700
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,670
You don't know that for sure.

701
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:50,570
Jack

702
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,590
Do it. Now!

703
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,710
Give him more volume.

704
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:01,511
Jack,please,please don't do this.

705
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,700
His lungs are damaged.

706
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,975
He's lost a lot of blood.

707
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,625
All I need you to do is stabilize him
so I can talk to him. Can you do that?

708
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,185
Maybe.

709
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,935
Then do it.

710
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,350
Deborah, I need you over here.

711
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:20,325
What about Mr. Raines?

712
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,230
Have one of the agents give chest
compressions if the pressure drops.

713
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:23,715
I got it.

714
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,690
Put some gloves on.

715
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,480
Jack

716
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,615
Jack

717
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,660
I have my orders! I'm doing my job!

718
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,805
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,890
You're sorry?! You're letting him die!

720
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:40,140
Get her away now!

721
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,205
Stop it, Jack!

722
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,740
Jack, stop!He saved your life!

723
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,430
There's a tension pneumo. We have
to relieve the pressure immediately.

724
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:47,631
Get me a chest tube!

725
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,970
Get him on a monitor.

726
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,110
Jack, please, stop this.

727
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,920
Pulse is weakening. Pressure dropping.

728
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,721
I'm begging you,Jack,stop it!

729
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,990
Hey, let go of me!

730
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,191
Please!

731
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,192
Let go of me!

732
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,760
Jack, Paul's crashing.

733
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,145
What can we do for him?

734
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,650
He's in v-fib. Use the defibrillator!

735
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,110
Charging.

736
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,200
Clear!

737
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,790
Hit him again, Jack!

738
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,020
Charging!

739
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,910
Clear!

740
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,985
He's still flatlining.

741
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,130
Give him a shot of epinephrine.

742
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:43,725
Where is it?

743
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,660
On the tray, second syringe from the left.

744
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,435
Got it.

745
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,510
Inject it in the iv.

746
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,331
It's in.

747
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,020
Come on...

748
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,910
Jack.

749
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,130
Jack. He's dead.

750
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,150
no!

751
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,150
Jack!

752
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,710
No!

753
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,250
He's gone.

754
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,210
oh, my god.

755
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,275
You son of a bitch, Jack!

756
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,470
You son of a bitch! You killed him!

757
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:12,005
He saved your life!

758
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,230
Get her out
of here- now.

759
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,075
You killed him! I hate you, Jack!

760
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,270
You killed him! How could you do this?!

761
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,910
You killed him, Jack.

762
00:42:21,945 --> 00:42:23,620
You killed him!

763
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,650
Let go of me!

764
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,670
Suture.

765
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,660
Is he gonna make it?

766
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,830
I'm doing the best I can.

767
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:05,531

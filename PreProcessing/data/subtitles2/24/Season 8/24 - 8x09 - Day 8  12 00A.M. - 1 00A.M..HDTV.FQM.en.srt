1
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:17,238
Renee!

2
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,500
Vladimir attacked you and you defended yourself.

3
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:21,500
That's what happened.

4
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:22,431
- I don't know.
- I do

5
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,656
and if anybody else ants to ask you questions about that,

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,405
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

7
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:28,313
You were implying something about Dana,

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,028
and I want to know what it is.

9
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,465
I think she went to meet some guy.

10
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:34,418
Take a look at this.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,650
You think you can find her?

12
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,020
You promise me I do this one thing for you,

13
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,151
and then you'll leave me alone.

14
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,727
That's not gonna happen.

15
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,908
This is a sweet operation that we got going here.

16
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,672
You know? You getting the access codes,

17
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:47,920
<i>and us pulling the jobs.</i>

18
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:49,817
You can't do this to me, Kevin.

19
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,650
You know who I am?

20
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,130
All I know is that there's

21
00:00:58,165 --> 00:00:59,935
a very powerful man in the Russian Syndicate

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,706
who's been trafficking weapons-grade uranium.

23
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:02,550
Who do you work for?

24
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,550
I'm not at liberty to say.

25
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,686
Dmitri, work on him,

26
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,650
until he's ready to tell us everything.

27
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:22,184
It's over, you know that, right?

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,268
You want to know where the rods are?

29
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:25,736
I will tell you.

30
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,851
But I want full immunity.

31
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,472
Amanda, are you seeing this?

32
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:35,826
Where the hell are the rods?

33
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,816
We've picked up trace radiation signatures.

34
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:38,988
The rods were here.

35
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,303
I told you, they were there.

36
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:42,838
I had two of my men guarding them.

37
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,338
<i>We found their bodies; both shot.</i>

38
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,351
Josef.

39
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:49,029
I wasn't sure I believed Josef that you would betray your father.

40
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,226
You were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods.

41
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,427
Now I've gotten them for you.

42
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,856
When will you get here?

43
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:55,251
<i>Less than five minutes.</i>

44
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,418
Just have my money ready.

45
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,718
<i>CTU. O'Brian.</i>

46
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,165
Chloe, it's Jack. Do you have Hastings there?

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,911
Yes.

48
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:56,712
- Are you ready to trace the call?
- We're ready.

49
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:58,478
As soon as Bazhaev gets his son on the phone,

50
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,795
we can begin to triangulate.

51
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,668
Okay, hold on.

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,884
Farhad, where are you? You're late.

53
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,587
<i>Josef, it's me, your father.</i>

54
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:16,258
Don't hang up. Stay on the line.

55
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,717
Please.

56
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,517
I know you have the rods.

57
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,102
Yes.

58
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,204
I wanted you to know.

59
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,797
The police know, too. They're here.

60
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,477
You told the police?

61
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:27,550
Of course not.

62
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,919
It was Vladimir's buyer-- he's a Federal agent.

63
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,068
Josef, just so we're up front, I'm here with your father.

64
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:34,478
My name is Jack Bauer; I work with CTU.

65
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,251
Well, do what you want with him; I don't care.

66
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,220
Maybe you don't-- but your father cares about you.

67
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,300
He negotiated immunity for you.

68
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,436
<i>All you need to do is bring the fuel rods in,</i>

69
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,538
<i>and you can put the rest of this behind you.</i>

70
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,082
<i>It's the only way you'll be safe.</i>

71
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,517
Safe? Did my father tell you about my other brother?

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,438
<i>What he did to him?</i>

73
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:55,066
Oleg was dying; you know that.

74
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,625
Yeah, we could have saved him.

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,972
<i>He would be alive if not for your precious deal.</i>

76
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,351
You are right, maybe you are right, I don't know, but...

77
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,051
that doesn't bring Oleg back,

78
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,184
and I cannot bear to lose another son.

79
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,465
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

80
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,569
- I'll be fine.
- No, you won't be.

81
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:10,974
You won't be anything.

82
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,324
It's over.

83
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,775
Federal agents are here going through everything.

84
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,010
The entire city is under guard.

85
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,076
If you don't bring the rods in, they will hunt you down.

86
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,388
They will kill you, Josef.

87
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:24,550
I won't be able to protect you.

88
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,751
I don't want to see you hurt.

89
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,649
If I hand over the rods, how does this work?

90
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,769
Tell us where you are, and we'll bring you in.

91
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,110
Oh, just like that?

92
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,408
After everything we've done?

93
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,318
Yes, I told you-- they have given us immunity.

94
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:45,784
Please, Josef, please.

95
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,917
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

96
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,951
<i>Are you there?</i>

97
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,327
Yes, I'm here.

98
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,084
You need to bring him in now,

99
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,789
before Farhad gets there.

100
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,461
Josef, did you hear that?

101
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,084
<i>You need to move.</i>

102
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,851
<i>Josef?</i>

103
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,320
All right, I'm on my way.

104
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,812
I'll call you from the road to let you know where to meet me.

105
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,485
Careful with the rods.

106
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,238
Sounded like shots fired.

107
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:17,332
You need to help him!

108
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,717
Where is he?!

109
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,537
I don't know.

110
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,970
Chloe, did you get a trace on that call?

111
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,334
Not exactly, but it looks like he was

112
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,974
in central Queens near Flushing Meadow Park.

113
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,436
I want units combing that area.

114
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,542
Jack, bring your suspect back to CTU.

115
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:31,437
Copy that. Get him ready for transport now.

116
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,650
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

117
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,170
We need to hurry.

118
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,845
<i>The boat is waiting for us at the port.</i>

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,485
The port may not be the right thing.

120
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,004
What do you mean?

121
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,684
The authorities know our plan.

122
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,884
We need a new one.

123
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,318
Hey.

124
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,662
Did you get that?

125
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:59,067
Yes, Jack. We're trying to get an ID off the voice print.

126
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:01,228
So far, no luck locking down a location.

127
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,354
Copy that. We're on our way back now.

128
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,262
<i>We need to hurry. Take the van and get the rods...</i>

129
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,277
We've got a match for the voice

130
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:19,817
at the end of the call-- Farhad Hassan.

131
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,583
So, he got his fuel rods.

132
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,499
Any ID on the other man we heard?

133
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,045
No, sir.

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,884
Mr. Hastings, Rob Weiss for you.

135
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,908
Tell him I'll be right with him.

136
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:34,760
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev.

137
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,464
- Yes, sir.
- Start the interrogation

138
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,817
as soon as he gets here.

139
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:44,743
Yeah?

140
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,786
Jack, it's Chloe. Hastings wants your ETA.

141
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,424
He's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev.

142
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,848
I'm about 15 minutes out.

143
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:51,786
But I wouldn't count on getting anything from him.

144
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,689
If Bazhaev could have told me how to get to the people

145
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,717
that just killed his son, he would have.

146
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,717
Jack, I heard about what you went through.

147
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,360
<i>Are you okay?</i>

148
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:04,418
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

149
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,018
How's Renee?

150
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,284
Pretty worried about you.

151
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:09,687
<i>They've still got her in medical.</i>

152
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,994
Yeah. Could you patch me through to her?

153
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,939
Hold on.

154
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:14,850
Okay.

155
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:20,232
Hey.

156
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,917
<i>Renee, I have Jack.</i>

157
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:24,940
Jack.

158
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,717
How are you?

159
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,835
Uh, fine, I'm fine. What about you?

160
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,920
We had a line on the fuel rods.

161
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:32,084
We lost it.

162
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:34,884
So what's the plan now?

163
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,182
<i>It's Hastings' call.</i>

164
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:38,650
I'm bringing the prisoner back to CTU, then I'm out.

165
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,051
They ask you about what happened, about Vladimir?

166
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:42,500
Uh, yes, Chloe did.

167
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:43,917
Chloe did the debrief?

168
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,860
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't...

169
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,069
I wouldn't really call it a debrief.

170
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,093
We talked, uh, mostly, and, uh,

171
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:51,048
<i>then I wrote a statement.</i>

172
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,830
And you explained how you acted in self-defense?

173
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:54,418
Yes, like we agreed.

174
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,158
<i>That's how it happened.</i>

175
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,951
Renee, you've got to stick with that.

176
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,650
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.

177
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,924
I know this is hard for you,

178
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,130
but you did nothing wrong,

179
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:07,559
<i>and you need to start believing that.</i>

180
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>Okay?</i>

181
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,318
Okay.

182
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,351
Jack, I don't... I don't know how to say this,

183
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,748
so I'm just gonna say it, 'cause I need to make sure

184
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:18,184
that I'm not misunderstanding, but...

185
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,679
<i>when you say that I "have you"...</i>

186
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:22,218
I meant it like it sounded.

187
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,584
So now what do we do?

188
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,151
We'll figure it out.

189
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:30,318
Okay.

190
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,147
I'll be in in about 15 minutes.

191
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,094
<i>Bye.</i>

192
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,895
- Rob, it's Brian.
- I just got a flash from your office how this

193
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,284
immunity situation the president authorized played out.

194
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:55,628
It's not good, Brian.

195
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:56,769
Really not.

196
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,851
Now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son swiped

197
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,784
the rods from his father before we got there.

198
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:01,409
That's correct.

199
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,684
- And now the son is dead.
- Yes.

200
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,110
Do we know who has the rods now?

201
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,843
Apparently, it's Farhad Hassan.

202
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,018
And where is he?

203
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,464
- We're looking.
- Meaning you have no idea.

204
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,876
<i>Brian, I pushed the president to resurrect CTU</i>

205
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:14,917
<i>with you at the helm.</i>

206
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,992
<i>Now, you tell me you can do the job, I believe you.</i>

207
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:18,405
I can do the job.

208
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,784
Good to hear it.

209
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,559
'Cause when things get this colossally screwed up,

210
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,377
people look for someone to blame.

211
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,617
So what are you saying?

212
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,771
I'm saying I don't want that person to be you.

213
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:31,717
I put you there; you're my guy.

214
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:34,160
If you fail, I fail.

215
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,376
And that cannot happen.

216
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,351
Are we on the same page here?

217
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,051
So what have you got in mind?

218
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,385
Renee Walker.

219
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,851
<i>She killed one of our main leads, isn't that correct?</i>

220
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,376
He was a psychopath-- she was defending herself.

221
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,718
She stabbed him 15 times.

222
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,822
What, are you saying it was murder?

223
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,210
<i>I'm saying that's for lawyers to decide.</i>

224
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,658
We're talking about a woman who put her life on the line

225
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:57,869
when she didn't have to.

226
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,917
I'm sure that will weigh in her favor.

227
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,199
You know what a conviction would mean--

228
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,363
she'd go away for years.

229
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,557
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian.

230
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,717
So you tell me-- who do you want that to be?

231
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,717
I'm sending someone over from Justice.

232
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,118
A Kristin Smith.

233
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,650
<i>She'll take care of everything.</i>

234
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:17,452
What do you need from me?

235
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:20,517
Just open the door and get out of the way.

236
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,567
We did a sweep, sir.

237
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,434
No trace of any hazardous materials.

238
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,834
- Fine. Finish up, get back to base.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,100
Arlo?

240
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah.

241
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,086
- Find Dana yet?
- I think so.

242
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,133
I'm tracking the GPS coordinates off her phone.

243
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,968
All right, send them to my PDA.

244
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,946
Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, there could be

245
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,522
a reasonable explanation why she's...

246
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,825
Hey, you're the one who stuck his nose in all this.

247
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,409
Just do it.

248
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:00,096
Okay.

249
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,300
Coordinates are on your phone.

250
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,262
Thanks.

251
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,374
Look, I'm sending everyone back to CTU.

252
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,467
What are you going to do?

253
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,701
I'll be there within the hour.

254
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,866
If Hastings asks, just tell him I'm following up a lead.

255
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,105
Look, I know Dana means a lot to you,

256
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,465
but do you really think this is worth going AWOL over?

257
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,133
She's my fianceé, Arlo.

258
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,853
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.

259
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,978
Find Owen, have him take SWAT back to CTU.

260
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,100
Say I'll be right behind them.

261
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,567
No problem, sir.

262
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:45,432
Is Dana back yet?

263
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:46,797
I don't think so, sir.

264
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,347
Do you need her for something?

265
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,933
Do I need her for something?

266
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:53,442
Yes, Arlo, she's my chief data analyst.

267
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,701
I need her to do her job.

268
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,781
You track her down, and you let me know when you find her.

269
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:01,475
Mr. Hastings, Kristin Smith from the Justice Department

270
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,397
- is here to see you.
- Thank you.

271
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:14,200
Ms. Smith.

272
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,468
Mr. Hastings.

273
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,285
- Did Rob Weiss brief you?
- He did.

274
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,827
I have to interview a Renee Walker.

275
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,334
I read her statement on the way over.

276
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,383
Did it appear to you that she's guilty of murder?

277
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,892
Mr. Weiss warned me you might have issues with this.

278
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,993
With hanging a brave woman out to dry?

279
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,164
Yes, I do.

280
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,412
There are major discrepancies between her statement

281
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,730
and the forensic evidence.

282
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:33,979
All I'm asking her to do

283
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,300
is to set the record straight.

284
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:42,508
I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access to this interview.

285
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:43,434
Fine.

286
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,938
But I would also like a video record of it

287
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,801
in the event of legal proceedings.

288
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,807
Can I ask you to provide that?

289
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,431
Yes. Right this way, please.

290
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,100
This is a transcript of your statement.

291
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,005
You should review it before you sign it.

292
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:10,512
How far out did Jack say he was?

293
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,834
15 minutes.

294
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,786
This is Kristin Smith from Justice.

295
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,901
She needs to talk to Renee,

296
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,400
so if you'll excuse us, Chloe.

297
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:19,667
Talk to her about what?

298
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,767
Now, Chloe.

299
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,767
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

300
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,636
What is she talking to her about?

301
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,772
She was about to sign her statement.

302
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:40,631
I already debriefed her.

303
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,667
Kristin just needs to fill in a few details.

304
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,016
I already filled in the details.

305
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,834
I know that you are protective of Renee.

306
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,167
- I respect that.
- Than let me sit in on the interview.

307
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,463
Why?

308
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:52,505
Was your debrief not a full and honest statement of the facts?

309
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,350
We have nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists.

310
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:58,160
Now, I need you back at your desk focused on that.

311
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,901
Yes, sir.

312
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:14,801
What is this place?

313
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:16,698
A staging area.

314
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,133
It belongs to a businessman who supports our cause.

315
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,148
I don't want to delay too long.

316
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:22,500
We need to find another way

317
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,668
to get the nuclear rods out of the country.

318
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:27,500
You heard what the American said to Bazhaev's son.

319
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,706
They already know what we're trying to do.

320
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,852
Which is why we need to move quickly.

321
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,964
The Americans are not stupid, Farhad.

322
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,476
If we go near any airfield or harbor now,

323
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,167
the radiological detectors will spot us.

324
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,364
Who are these men, Samir?

325
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,334
These are men I have recruited. Our men.

326
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,567
What are they doing here?

327
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,200
They're going to unload the rods.

328
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,799
We need to get rid of the van.

329
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:20,995
And then what?

330
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,001
You should rest.

331
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,828
I don't need to rest.

332
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,334
I need to know what we're doing.

333
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,267
We can't get the rods out of the country.

334
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,184
So let's use them.

335
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,068
Use them? How?

336
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,434
As a weapon.

337
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,567
A radiological bomb.

338
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,100
We'll show the Americans how strong we are.

339
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:49,777
Show them how strong we are?

340
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,765
Are you out of your mind?

341
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,357
If we use the rods against the Americans,

342
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,995
they will destroy our country.

343
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,934
They'll bomb us, invade.

344
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,729
And if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway.

345
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:06,233
That's what this peace treaty with your brother is all about.

346
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,239
They're trying to turn us into another corrupt,

347
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,469
Mid-East regime with your brother as dictator,

348
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,534
kept in power by American guns

349
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,267
and money.

350
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,601
Isn't that what we came together to prevent?

351
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,534
Is there no other way?

352
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:35,100
America will always be our enemy.

353
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,020
Remember, my friend--

354
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:44,567
even a giant can be toppled by a single stone.

355
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,034
We need to make them fear us.

356
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:03,735
Then I'm with you.

357
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,197
<i>So you said in your statement</i>

358
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:46,434
<i>that you killed Vladimir Laitanan in self-defense.</i>

359
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,000
Is that correct?

360
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,900
Yes, that's why it's in my statement.

361
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:51,812
What I didn't see in the statement

362
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,701
was any mention of your history with Laitanan.

363
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,768
You did have a history with him.

364
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,924
I worked an undercover operation with the FBI six years ago.

365
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,401
Vladimir Laitanan was the target.

366
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:03,528
And during the course of that operation,

367
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,667
you had to get close to him.

368
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:07,737
He became obsessed with you.

369
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,933
He tried to rape you.

370
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,446
Yes.

371
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,200
But you were able to stop him.

372
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:15,067
I fought him.

373
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,701
Put me in the hospital with two broken ribs.

374
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm sure that's in there, too.

375
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:22,836
You were able to fight off a stronger, violent man.

376
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,868
It's impressive.

377
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,670
But this time when he attacked you,

378
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:29,917
you didn't fight him off.

379
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,000
I couldn't.

380
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,933
He had his hands around my neck trying to strangle me.

381
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,501
I understand.

382
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,567
You thought he was going to kill you.

383
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,200
You were in fear for your life.

384
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:50,555
So what happened next?

385
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,868
Uh... He was choking me.

386
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:58,361
I grabbed the knife and I stabbed him.

387
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,900
In self-defense?

388
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,567
Yes.

389
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:07,768
You stabbed him in self-defense... 15 times.

390
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,467
15 times.

391
00:20:11,758 --> 00:20:14,020
The first blow alone could have stopped him,

392
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,501
<i>but you didn't stop.</i>

393
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,152
Look at me, Renee.

394
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,801
You were an investigator for the FBI.

395
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,128
By all accounts, one of the best they had.

396
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,286
Put yourself on my side of the table.

397
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,768
Look at what I'm looking at.

398
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,267
There's a dead body.

399
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,947
On the one hand, I have your statement

400
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,263
saying you acted in self-defense.

401
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,501
On the other, I have these.

402
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,028
Evidence of a sustained

403
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:50,291
and furious assault with clear intent to kill.

404
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,397
Now as an investigator,

405
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,900
you know which version is true, don't you?

406
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:58,167
I acted in self-defense.

407
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,796
Let me tell you what I think happened.

408
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,497
You used an operation of unparalleled importance

409
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,824
to seek revenge against a target without any regard

410
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,534
for the final outcome.

411
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm telling you, he attacked me first.

412
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:17,515
Ms. Walker, I'm well aware of your sacrifice

413
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,167
<i>in service to this country, but I do not think</i>

414
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,757
<i>that it is fair or right that CTU should be taken down</i>

415
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,946
because you used this operation to seek out

416
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,672
your own personal vendetta against Vladimir Laitanan.

417
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,868
I looked at your file.

418
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,253
This isn't the first time you lost control.

419
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,100
You almost killed Alan Wilson.

420
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:46,522
That's why you got fired by the FBI, isn't it?

421
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,367
Yes.

422
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,511
I can see what this is doing to you, Renee.

423
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,200
It is tearing you up inside.

424
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:03,574
Let it out. Tell me the truth.

425
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,570
You killed Vladimir Laitanan because the thought

426
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:10,136
of him touching you again was intolerable.

427
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,768
Do the right thing here.

428
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,900
That's what happened, isn't it, Renee?

429
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:30,567
Is that right, Renee?

430
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:44,567
Put him into holding.

431
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:46,068
No phone calls. No communication.

432
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,535
I would like to see my son's body.

433
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,034
We haven't found him yet.

434
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,637
- What's wrong?
- I've been trying to reach you.

435
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,539
It's about Renee. She's being questioned again.

436
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,395
I thought you said you already completed the debrief.

437
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,897
I did. Hastings ordered it.

438
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:59,200
He called in some woman from the Justice Department.

439
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:00,868
Where's Renee now?

440
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,768
She's in medical.

441
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,011
Can you get eyes in that room?

442
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,933
No. He cut off all access.

443
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,267
What is going on?

444
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,122
They're setting her up to take the fall

445
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,557
for the failure of this mission.

446
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,401
Sorry, sir. No one's...

447
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,233
They're setting you up. Don't say another word.

448
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:39,898
It's too late.

449
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,053
What do you think you're doing? Get out of here now.

450
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:45,240
How dare you?

451
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,134
After everything she sacrificed.

452
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,267
After everything she's lost.

453
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:52,238
Have you no decency?

454
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,067
Jack.

455
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,900
This is over.

456
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:00,768
Hands in the air.

457
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,000
Do it now!

458
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,634
Son, you better put that down

459
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,501
or you're going to get hurt.

460
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:09,834
It's all right.

461
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,768
Go.

462
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,667
Ma'am, hands in the air.

463
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,192
Do you have what you need

464
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:37,917
to turn the rods into a bomb?

465
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:41,000
We're gathering materials.

466
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:44,534
Must be difficult at such short notice.

467
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:49,367
Explosives, no. Detonator?

468
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,033
We're working on it.

469
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,768
I might know somebody.

470
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,868
A professor in the city.

471
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,234
With expertise in electronics.

472
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:00,534
You sure he can be trusted?

473
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,701
Yes.

474
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,134
He will help.

475
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,033
He will do whatever I ask.

476
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,367
But still...

477
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,334
I will bring this up very carefully.

478
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,834
I need to talk to him in private.

479
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,634
Very well.

480
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,385
There's a phone in the office. Ali will take you.

481
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:49,467
What is the target? Is that decided?

482
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:55,234
So many targets in New York.

483
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:57,234
It will be hard to choose.

484
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,834
Samir! Over here!

485
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:30,734
It was Farhad. He escaped.

486
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:33,834
Find him!

487
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,321
Now!

488
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,628
Cuffs off.

489
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:01,193
Give us the room.

490
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,574
Sit down, Jack.

491
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,120
I'll stand.

492
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:09,676
So, this is the new CTU-- you hang your own.

493
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,045
If you mean Renee Walker, we're just asking some questions.

494
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,856
Standard procedure.

495
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:15,379
Standard procedure is a debrief, which Chloe completed.

496
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,867
But instead, you've got some hack from Justice in there

497
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,563
trying to initiate a criminal prosecution.

498
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,225
We're just trying to establish the facts.

499
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,294
You're trying to save your ass.

500
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,025
I was there when you asked her for her help.

501
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,094
And she gave it to you, and we acquired the target.

502
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:33,494
And this is how you pay her back.

503
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,427
I'm not going to let you do this.

504
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,461
I'll call the White House first.

505
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:38,722
The White House knows.

506
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,785
Rob Weiss sent that woman over here.

507
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,993
Sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear.

508
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,132
I meant I'd call the president.

509
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,159
Well, good luck with that, Jack, because I think

510
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,116
the president takes murder pretty seriously.

511
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:50,661
My recollection? She prosecuted her own daughter.

512
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,339
Now, I'm not asking. Sit down.

513
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:08,602
Sorry to interrupt.

514
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,944
- We're busy, Chloe.
- I don't mean to intrude,

515
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,397
but I've got Farhad Hassan on the line.

516
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:13,286
Farhad Hassan?

517
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,860
I didn't believe it, either, but the voice prints match.

518
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,102
Can you tell where he is?

519
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,448
No. He's on a secure line.

520
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:19,760
Can I just put him through?

521
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,765
Mr. Hassan.

522
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,442
<i>This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU.</i>

523
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:30,090
There are people chasing me.

524
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,588
They have the rods you're looking for.

525
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:32,904
I thought you had the rods.

526
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:34,484
No. No more.

527
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,754
They turned against me.

528
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,661
They have their own plan--

529
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:39,189
an attack on New York.

530
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:40,683
An attack on New York?

531
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,765
When, exactly?

532
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,682
<i>Soon.</i>

533
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:43,855
Very soon.

534
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,961
Who are these people?

535
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:47,208
They are IRK operatives working in this country.

536
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,677
Okay, I need names.

537
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:51,065
Just get me out of here.

538
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,696
<i>I'll tell you everything I know.</i>

539
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,257
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

540
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,044
I give you my word. Now, where are you?

541
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,527
Forest Hills.

542
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:02,405
Uh, some kind of boat warehouse.

543
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,052
Hurry. I'm injured.

544
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:05,630
They're hunting me.

545
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:08,160
Hold on and keep this line open.

546
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:09,371
What do you want me to do?

547
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,173
Pinpoint his location and get me Cole.

548
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:11,778
I can't.

549
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:13,245
What do you mean, you can't?

550
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,983
His team came back. He didn't.

551
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,686
Owen said he was following a lead.

552
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,745
All right, fine. Get me Owen.

553
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,407
Tell him he's going to be leading the team.

554
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:20,984
Owen? Are you sure?

555
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,527
Just do it, Chloe.

556
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,313
They're going to take you down and process you.

557
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:34,060
I want you out of this building.

558
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,603
Fine.

559
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:05,167
Hey, hey, come on.

560
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:06,826
What's the hurry? What's the hurry?

561
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:08,845
What's the hurry? Your friend's a total freak show.

562
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,954
Hey. I know, but come on.

563
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,615
Don't go. I'll make it up to you.

564
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,048
Okay? Come on.

565
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,764
At least let me give you a ride back into town.

566
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,261
We'll walk.

567
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,506
Night, ladies!

568
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:28,510
I take a leak.

569
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,514
All right.

570
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,143
Cole, what are you doing here?

571
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,925
You're asking me that? We're in the middle

572
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,475
of an operation, Dana. You can't just abandon your post.

573
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,733
I can explain.

574
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:18,167
You can explain later.

575
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,920
Right now, I'm taking you back to CTU.

576
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:21,636
We can deal with our personal problems

577
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,318
after we've secured the nuclear materials.

578
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:24,669
It's not what you think.

579
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:25,950
Yeah? What do I think?

580
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,688
I am not sleeping with him.

581
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,391
Save it. I saw the pictures.

582
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,592
What pictures?

583
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:31,723
Just get in.

584
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,992
- I am not leaving!
- Why the hell not?

585
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,227
Because if I leave, this will never end.

586
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,102
What will never end?

587
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,909
You do not understand.

588
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,659
Then make me understand, damn it!

589
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,952
I don't think that I can.

590
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:44,594
Try.

591
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:50,728
Okay.

592
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,467
We don't have a lot of time.

593
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,127
So you better start talking.

594
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,602
My name is not Dana Walsh.

595
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,361
It's Jenny Scott.

596
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:53,596
Yes?

597
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:54,812
You find Farhad?

598
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,994
Still looking.

599
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:57,499
I injured him badly.

600
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:58,936
He won't get far.

601
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:01,127
We don't know who he might have contacted.

602
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:03,493
I'll be traveling with the rods to a secure location.

603
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:04,794
Do you want me to come in?

604
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:05,523
<i>No.</i>

605
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:08,794
You stay here, and you find him.

606
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:30,094
It's a six-acre warehouse complex in Forest Hills.

607
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:32,584
Farhad is somewhere in one of these buildings.

608
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,042
The rods must be there, too. Drones are airborne,

609
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,194
but they won't have eyes for another 12 minutes.

610
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:38,261
What about the police?

611
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:40,484
They're redirecting their resources, but it's a big area--

612
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,114
it's gonna take a while to cordon off.

613
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,530
Director Hastings. You wanted to see me, sir?

614
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,760
In the absence of Agent Ortiz,

615
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:49,161
I assume you're ready to take charge of the operation.

616
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,694
- Yes, sir. Three units standing by.
- All right. I'll walk you out.

617
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,532
- There's a lot of pressure on you, Agent Owen.
- Oh, I can handle it, sir.

618
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,672
All right, talk me through it. What's the attack grid?

619
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,711
Our working theory's that the nuclear materials

620
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,354
are still in the proximity of Farhad.

621
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,958
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked

622
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:03,527
with locating and securing the rods.

623
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,510
What about Team Charlie?

624
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,469
They're responsible for the actual evac, sir.

625
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,394
It's a standard urban search-and-rescue--

626
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,994
we're in, we're out.

627
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:12,361
Nothing standard about it.

628
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,941
Wait here.

629
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,261
Jack.

630
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,194
Jack.

631
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,439
You've got something to say, say it.

632
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:26,727
Think about it. The people that are chasing Farhad

633
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,560
already know they've got a big security problem,

634
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,716
so most likely by the time your men get there,

635
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:32,727
those fuel rods will be long gone.

636
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,527
And you're down to one team covering Farhad?

637
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,094
What if they run into resistance?

638
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:37,035
What if they do?

639
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,560
Well, at that point, you start shooting at people

640
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:39,940
that have a higher intel value

641
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:41,171
than the man you're going to try and save.

642
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,526
Agent Owen knows the priority is to take all hostiles alive.

643
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:45,794
Under fire?

644
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:47,227
No assignment's more difficult.

645
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:49,294
Agent Owen has my full confidence.

646
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,093
Yeah. If that were true,

647
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,127
you wouldn't be standing here talking to me.

648
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,927
You offering to bring in Farhad?

649
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:01,259
Yes. If you drop the criminal investigation

650
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:02,961
against Renee Walker.

651
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:06,428
Look, I know you don't want to prosecute her.

652
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,328
I can be your out.

653
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:12,061
I hear what you're saying, but I can't help you, Jack.

654
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:15,916
I've sat in that chair before.

655
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,936
The chair you're sitting in now.

656
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:21,521
I know what it's like.

657
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,817
There's a lot of demands on you,

658
00:35:22,852 --> 00:35:25,081
many of them unreasonable.

659
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:29,560
But the people that last here, the ones that mattered...

660
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,760
they knew when to say no.

661
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:34,369
It's the White House; you don't say no.

662
00:35:34,404 --> 00:35:36,588
You are the head of CTU--

663
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:38,925
you've got a lot more juice than you think.

664
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,227
Especially with a nuclear weapon in play.

665
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,007
If we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation.

666
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:51,223
It's till this whole thing is over and done.

667
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:54,971
You want Renee freed up, you're not in and out anymore.

668
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:58,027
I want you in with both feet.

669
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,833
Deal.

670
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,315
Deal.

671
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:16,546
I found an NYPD evidence warehouse in Queens

672
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:20,694
with $120,000 from a drug bust just sitting there.

673
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,348
It was only a matter of getting them in

674
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,655
and out between patrols.

675
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,994
Wait, you actually committed a robbery?

676
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:33,061
Put yourself in my place, Cole.

677
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:35,827
Kevin was going to tell Hastings I'm a convicted felon.

678
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:37,484
He was going to ruin my life.

679
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,882
What would you have done?

680
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,328
Not this.

681
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,493
Kevin promised that if I went along,

682
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,493
he would never bother me again.

683
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,127
Let me guess.

684
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,361
He didn't keep his end of the bargain.

685
00:36:55,975 --> 00:36:58,061
That's why you're here, isn't it?

686
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:01,694
What do you mean?

687
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,727
What's in your hand?

688
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:15,764
You were going to kill them.

689
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,592
I don't know what I was going to do.

690
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,860
You were going to shoot them in cold blood.

691
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:22,500
Cole, listen to me.

692
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:23,860
I was wrong.

693
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:27,127
I see that now, but I was scared.

694
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,706
I thought that I was doing this for us.

695
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,560
For us? Are you out of your mind?

696
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:38,261
I love you, Cole.

697
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:41,961
Don't say another word.

698
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,261
Not one more word.

699
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:47,931
Cole, where are you going? Cole!

700
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,213
Stay in the truck.

701
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,460
Cole, don't do this.

702
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,660
Cole.

703
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:55,961
Please, I am begging you.

704
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,493
This is my problem, not yours.

705
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,493
Stay back.

706
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:02,394
What?

707
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,459
Hey, hey!

708
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:16,695
Yeah, go for it.

709
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,194
That way, I only have to deal with one of you losers.

710
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,030
I think you got the wrong address, pal.

711
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh, do I?

712
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:27,161
Somehow, I don't think so.

713
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,512
Hey, maybe you should just tell us what it is you want.

714
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,328
Maybe you should shut up and listen.

715
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:33,069
Cole, please, come on.

716
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,760
Let's just get out of here.

717
00:38:41,182 --> 00:38:43,013
I thought you looked familiar.

718
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,493
Looky here, Nick.

719
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,694
- It's soldier boy.
- Mm-hmm.

720
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,493
No kidding.

721
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,713
You know, it's a shame

722
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,744
that you and I can't go grab a beer sometime.

723
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,493
You know, just the two of us.

724
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,155
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.

725
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,064
I said shut up.

726
00:39:04,337 --> 00:39:07,794
Now, the way I see it, you guys have two choices.

727
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,017
One, you go back to prison

728
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:13,119
for grand larceny and aggravated assault.

729
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:16,186
I go back to prison, she goes back to prison.

730
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:19,114
My guess is, she's prepared to live with that.

731
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,560
Choice number two: I let you walk.

732
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,610
You keep your 100 grand--

733
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:28,627
or what's left of it--

734
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,161
and you go back to wherever it is you came from.

735
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:34,898
That's it?

736
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,094
That's it.

737
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:39,752
But if I ever see you in this city again...

738
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,685
if I even hear about you crossing the state line,

739
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:45,927
I'll skip the formalities

740
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,227
and kill you myself.

741
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:52,860
Do we have a deal or not?

742
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,593
Yeah.

743
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:00,694
We got a deal.

744
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:02,994
Better be sure.

745
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,823
I don't want to see either one of you ever again.

746
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:27,061
Hey, what are you doing?

747
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,061
Going after him.

748
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,527
Why?

749
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,194
Oh, we get rid of him,

750
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,994
we're right back in business with her.

751
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,428
Come on, man.

752
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,760
We got what we came for.

753
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,854
We got more.

754
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:41,794
Now, let's just... let's not push our luck.

755
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,061
All right?

756
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:44,361
Come on, all right?

757
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:45,627
We're just getting started.

758
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,860
We're done.

759
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:52,428
Okay?

760
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,627
You got me?

761
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,142
Cole.

762
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:06,761
What you did back there,

763
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,098
I'll never forget it.

764
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,061
Let's just get back to CTU.

765
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,194
Cole, I'm serious.

766
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,860
Thank you.

767
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,560
Cole.

768
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:25,560
Jenny!

769
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,328
I'm sorry.

770
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:10,408
I shouldn't have come back.

771
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:24,217

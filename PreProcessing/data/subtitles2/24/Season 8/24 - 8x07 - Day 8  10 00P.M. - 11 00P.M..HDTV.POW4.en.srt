1
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,932
President Hassan's security forces--

2
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,269
they're still cracking down on the opposition

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,216
and they're not showing any signs of letting up.

4
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:20,440
The rumors have already started

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,826
that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.

6
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:25,431
Assemble the representatives.

7
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:27,058
I want to appeal to them myself

8
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,398
to stay the course.

9
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:31,444
One of the suspects has family connections

10
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,131
to a member of our delegation here at the UN.

11
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:34,952
Who?

12
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,598
Jamot.

13
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,448
Are you arresting me?

14
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,595
I demand to speak with President Hassan.

15
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,981
President Hassan is the one who gave this order.

16
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,713
What's wrong? You sound upset.

17
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,403
I need to speak with you about your father.

18
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,992
<i>I have to go to the embassy right now.</i>

19
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:50,561
I'll meet you in private when I get back.

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,629
This has the address and schematic

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,880
of the evidence lockup.

22
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,166
This keycard will get you access.

23
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:57,325
How do we find the money?

24
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,726
The evidence bins are numbered.

25
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,826
Do exactly what I tell you to do,

26
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:02,867
and you'll be in and out.

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:04,084
No one will know you're there.

28
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,741
The authorities know about the nuclear material.

29
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,411
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

30
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,260
No doctors.

31
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:14,645
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.

32
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:16,158
He showed me how.

33
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,485
Who are you to question my judgment?

34
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,644
Never disobey an order from your father.

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,131
I'm sorry, my son.

36
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,326
Tell me about this buyer.

37
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,707
His name is Ernst Meier,

38
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,109
German arms dealer.

39
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,514
What's he looking to buy?

40
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:34,899
Weapons-grade uranium.

41
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:37,370
I'm going to have to meet this Meier,

42
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,347
and I need a good-faith payment up front.

43
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,515
I'm not going to tell you again.

44
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:43,062
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

45
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:45,615
Damn it, come here

46
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,240
or the deal's off.

47
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,170
Meier?

48
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:52,457
That's right.

49
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:55,103
Where is the $5 million?

50
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,101
The money is in your account.

51
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,162
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it!

52
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,343
Meier. You really think you can roll me for $5 million?

53
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,785
Let me talk to my man.

54
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,021
Yes.

55
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,396
Bring him back here.

56
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,018
He wants to see you.

57
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:13,698
Get up.

58
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,473
Thank you so much.

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,555
Well, that went well.

60
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,284
Unanimous support for the treaty--

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,697
well, nearly unanimous, anyway.

62
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,243
I have the distinct impression

63
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:36,755
that I am running out of goodwill.

64
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,556
Maybe, but you bought yourself some breathing room.

65
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,845
These people are already up past their bedtimes.

66
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,544
I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing

67
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,479
until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

68
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,153
Congratulations, Madam President.

69
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,855
Thank you, I appreciated your support.

70
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,491
Good.

71
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,540
Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on.

72
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:54,933
I thought I did.

73
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,425
You invoked national security,

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,327
which, with respect, is not an explanation.

75
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,760
It's saying "Don't ask."

76
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,099
Madam President,

77
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:03,258
our countries have a unique relationship

78
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,984
based on a trust developed over nearly a century now.

79
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,521
Anything you say to me is

80
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,277
in the strictest confidence.

81
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,846
You may tell your prime minister and no one else

82
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,675
that President Hassan's crackdown

83
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,347
isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.

84
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,628
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.

85
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,185
Apparently a faction inside his country was so disturbed

86
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,282
by the prospect of disarmament,

87
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,566
they decided to take matters into their own hands.

88
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,492
Where are the materials?

89
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,293
Here on our soil.

90
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,118
CTU is running an undercover operation

91
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,890
to retrieve them as we speak.

92
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:43,434
Who is that?

93
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,572
My guess is, it is my backup.

94
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,868
No calls till we get to Vladimir.

95
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,907
Does this look like a situation

96
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,526
where you get to make demands?

97
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,236
It's Meier.

98
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,614
I lost my sight line on you.

99
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:54,476
I'm leaving the building.

100
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,685
I understand.

101
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:56,801
Everything okay?

102
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,782
The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account.

103
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,972
We're going to his office. We should be there in a few minutes.

104
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:02,441
I'll follow with a backup team.

105
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,263
That might not be necessary.

106
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,161
<i>After what they just pulled,</i>

107
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,034
you're sure you're comfortable without backup?

108
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,829
There are other considerations.

109
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,389
You mean they have Renee.

110
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,562
That's right.

111
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:13,962
Okay, we'll stay back.

112
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,137
I'll let you know.

113
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,394
What was that?

114
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:18,794
Let him know what?

115
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,944
Shut up and drive.

116
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,708
Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam.

117
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:25,809
Is everything okay?

118
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,834
Jack seems to be in control.

119
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,631
Looks fine, all things considered.

120
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,288
Driver looks a little worried.

121
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,809
Who is this guy anyway?

122
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,895
Should I pass him on to facial recognition?

123
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:40,352
Dana?

124
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:41,852
I've got to take this.

125
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,236
Yeah, sure, no biggie.

126
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,964
Just unsecured nuclear materials.

127
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,055
Yes.

128
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,633
We're there, outside the evidence building.

129
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,866
<i>You're in the side alley, right?</i>

130
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:56,906
No,

131
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:58,859
we parked out front so everyone can see us.

132
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,699
Come on, what do you think I am?

133
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,881
Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step.

134
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,200
I know, we're ready.

135
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,825
Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on

136
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,766
for a few minutes.

137
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,943
Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny.

138
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,082
You'll be fine if you just stay still.

139
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,250
We have a 30-minute window before the next security pass.

140
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,950
I will be with you the second I can.

141
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,093
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office for a field update.

142
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,080
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

143
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,361
If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical.

144
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,730
If your fiancé was cheating on you,

145
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,932
would you want to know?

146
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:30,905
Hypothetically, who'd be asking--

147
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,052
some creepy stalker who's about to get fired?

148
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,408
I'm serious.

149
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:35,989
So am I. Just go upstairs.

150
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,123
It's none of your business.

151
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,608
Dana, Cole just called about Jack.

152
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,602
He's almost to Laitanan.

153
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,567
Hastings wants us in his office.

154
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,063
Pass me back the keys.

155
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,904
Slowly get out,

156
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,288
put your hands on the roof.

157
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,708
Let's go.

158
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,808
So this is how you do business?

159
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,874
I wire you the $5 million like we agreed,

160
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,197
and then you try and take me out.

161
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,479
I did not think you were for real.

162
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,722
It was a misunderstanding,

163
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,140
but it's past.

164
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,451
We are here.

165
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,572
As an act of good faith,

166
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,813
Vladimir has already started calling his contacts,

167
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,827
inquiring about the nuclear materials.

168
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,169
I don't care what he's done.

169
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,531
I want to talk to you.

170
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:52,627
So talk.

171
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,833
I want to talk to my partner alone now.

172
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,452
Look, he's upset,

173
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:12,741
understandably.

174
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,272
It will be fine. Yeah?

175
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:21,804
This is our chance.

176
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,436
We should take him out now.

177
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,978
No, we need him to do this deal.

178
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,171
Don't risk everything for a whore.

179
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,201
You ever talk about her like that again,

180
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,583
I'll kill you.

181
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,347
You understand?

182
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,515
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,303
I have authorization to pull you out.

184
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,338
No, that's not possible.

185
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,619
Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it.

186
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,094
Jack, you can't. He doesn't trust you, first of all.

187
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,925
The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me.

188
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,439
I'm fine, really.

189
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,212
You want to make calls, let's go.

190
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:56,623
You don't have a say in this. I am pulling you out.

191
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:58,750
No, look, it's not a big deal.

192
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,539
I know what he did to you six years ago,

193
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:01,896
and it is a big deal.

194
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,450
Jack, if we stop this now,

195
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,011
then everything that I have done is for nothing.

196
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,337
We're running out of time.

197
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:09,362
Let's go.

198
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,456
We're almost there, it'll be worth it.

199
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,440
Kevin, are you there?

200
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,189
Yeah.

201
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,782
<i>I thought you forgot about us.</i>

202
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,770
I wish I could.

203
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:41,839
Come on, don't be like that.

204
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:42,809
Are we good to go?

205
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,809
Yes, move now.

206
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:58,771
Let's go.

207
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,710
There's a security panel next to the door.

208
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:02,768
Use the keycard I gave you.

209
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,719
The code is 1668.

210
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,809
1668.

211
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,509
166...

212
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,227
Keep moving, it will stop in a second.

213
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,820
If you want the $120,000

214
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,233
you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes.

215
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,393
Okay, which door is it?

216
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:33,668
It's the last one on the left.

217
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:38,045
The code is 4660.

218
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,580
Four...

219
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:55,882
It's like Christmas... with chain link.

220
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,303
<i>Okay, how do we find the money?</i>

221
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,535
It's in section 3101.

222
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,361
- 3101.
It's down the aisle on your left.

223
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:08,186
- 3101.
- The code is 2824.

224
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,354
The last one on the left.

225
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,508
3101-- do you see it?

226
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,839
Yeah, right here.

227
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,187
What the hell, man?

228
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,504
Jen, what the hell is going on?

229
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:33,724
What number is it?

230
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,228
<i>Is it 3101?</i>

231
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,853
3101-- this is 3110.

232
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:38,327
Come on.

233
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:39,739
What is wrong with you two?

234
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:40,870
Hey, it's called a mistake, all right?

235
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,670
Back off.

236
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:43,139
So where is it?

237
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:48,016
3101 is down the aisle on the left.

238
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,034
- Down here, down here.
- The code is 2824.

239
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,980
2824, 2824, 2824.

240
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,596
Bin number's 4301.

241
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,403
4301.

242
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,866
Oh, man, it's too many numbers.

243
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,789
4301, 4301.

244
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,084
Boom! Got it!

245
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,048
That's beautiful, man.

246
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,652
That's beautiful.

247
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,841
Just shut up and get out of there.

248
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:26,139
The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes.

249
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,544
You've got the money.

250
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,445
Close the doors and leave.

251
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,809
15 minutes. We're leaving.

252
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,969
Call me when you're clear.

253
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,658
I sure will, Jenny.

254
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,324
Let's go!

255
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,801
Not yet.

256
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,101
Check out some of this stuff.

257
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,297
Hey, seriously, come on, man.

258
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:44,482
Patrol's on its way.

259
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,679
Yeah, 15 minutes.

260
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,503
Are you sure, then?

261
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:19,122
You haven't heard of anyone dealing in these materials?

262
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:24,095
All right. Well, thank you for your time.

263
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,635
I'm sorry to trouble you.

264
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:29,138
Nothing.

265
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,097
They did not appreciate being called so late.

266
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,510
Renee, cut me some bread.

267
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,484
Here.

268
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,518
You might want to ease up on the drinking.

269
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,274
You've got some calls to make.

270
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,784
I drink what I want.

271
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,591
Renee, where's the bread?

272
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,017
Coming.

273
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:01,284
Drink.

274
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,088
What is this?

275
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,778
It is too thin.

276
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,516
It should be thick.

277
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:20,364
Nice and thick.

278
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,424
There we are.

279
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:28,346
She's changed, you know?

280
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,279
Six years ago,

281
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,568
she thought she was too good for me.

282
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,265
Now, she is much more friendly.

283
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,833
Maybe I should thank you--

284
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:44,677
all that time you were together in Mexico City.

285
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,077
Come on.

286
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,791
I see how you look at her.

287
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,440
Don't tell me you didn't.

288
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,049
You want to keep talking, do it on the phone.

289
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,995
Otherwise, the nuclear materials will be gone,

290
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,958
and this deal will be dead.

291
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,088
Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck.

292
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,127
Lugo, get him out of here.

293
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,496
And I'm running out of my vodka.

294
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:13,656
Go get me some more.

295
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,622
Sit down.

296
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:33,964
I won't be long.

297
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:54,539
My younger son.

298
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,626
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.

299
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,442
Of course, but that will take a little time.

300
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,730
The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave...

301
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,086
No. You will do it now

302
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:07,962
out back.

303
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,035
My men will dig his grave.

304
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,475
Sergei Petrovich,

305
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,700
this isn't right.

306
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,203
Then make it right.

307
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,990
Treat him like a soldier who died on the battlefield

308
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,485
and must be buried there.

309
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,155
Is that how he died?

310
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,596
In battle?

311
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,331
You just make it right.

312
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:32,831
Say all the prayers.

313
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,185
Where I end up, I don't care.

314
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,429
But this boy is with the angels.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,906
My men will be with you soon.

316
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,104
Leave us.

317
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,263
Get up.

318
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,311
Look at me, Josef.

319
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,479
I want you to understand

320
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,768
that everything I've done, I've done for you

321
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,659
and for our family.

322
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,145
You killed my brother.

323
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:35,019
Because I loved him,

324
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,950
because I couldn't bear to see him suffer,

325
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:41,071
because there was no other way.

326
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,282
There's always another way.

327
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,057
Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials.

328
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,223
We cannot risk the authorities finding out.

329
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,197
You know that.

330
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,673
You don't know why I'm doing this?

331
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,513
Because when I die,

332
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:57,619
I want to leave you

333
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,162
and your family a worthy inheritance.

334
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,858
Wealth, respect,

335
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,304
consequence.

336
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,985
Can you understand that?

337
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,832
One day you will.

338
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,979
As your son grows older, you will.

339
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,564
And you will understand

340
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,737
how much I love you.

341
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,323
My only son.

342
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,837
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.

343
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,888
Will you help him?

344
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:40,182
He's my brother.

345
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:42,542
Thank you.

346
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,491
Call when you are ready.

347
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,467
What is it?

348
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,877
Vladimir Laitanan.

349
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,355
He says it's important.

350
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,009
Vladimir, what do you want?

351
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,478
Sergei Petrovich.

352
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,134
I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir.

353
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,274
Uh, your family is well?

354
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,724
I said, what do you want?

355
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,549
I have a business proposition.

356
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,095
Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night.

357
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,576
No, no, no, this can't wait.

358
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:23,093
I hear there are materials for sale,

359
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,749
expensive materials, dangerous ones.

360
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,817
Talk straight. What materials?

361
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,483
Nuclear rods.

362
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,377
Highly enriched uranium.

363
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,002
So, why are you calling me?

364
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,882
If anyone has the organization

365
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,516
to pull off such a deal, it's you.

366
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm flattered.

367
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,532
I have a buyer here, a German.

368
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:47,272
He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them.

369
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,940
Double any offer you have.

370
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,616
Then he is as stupid as you are.

371
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,576
Are you out of your mind?

372
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,624
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.

373
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,078
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,459
A misunderstanding.

375
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,721
Don't call me again.

376
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,461
He had no idea what I was talking about.

377
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,337
All right, then we call the next person.

378
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,165
You're not listening.

379
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,286
He says nobody sells these things.

380
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,639
Nobody.

381
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,811
You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir.

382
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,780
He's just jealous that he's not in on it.

383
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:26,908
Come here. Come here.

384
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:30,801
Look, later.

385
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,493
Later.

386
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,659
Once you've made more calls.

387
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,163
Come on.

388
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,612
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,774
We have a problem.

390
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,272
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.

391
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,555
What are you going to do?

392
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,025
Da.

393
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,427
Anton?

394
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,159
Yes?

395
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:01,203
Mr. President, it's Allison Taylor.

396
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,559
We were scheduled to resume our discussions.

397
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:05,393
I'm late, I know. I apologize.

398
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:06,702
The events of this evening...

399
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,999
The events of this evening make it more important than ever

400
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,756
that we complete our work on this treaty.

401
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:14,889
<i>Mr. President, I need to know your intentions.</i>

402
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:17,002
My intentions?

403
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,188
The crackdown on your countrymen.

404
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,095
I've been informed

405
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,113
that you've even arrested one of your own delegation.

406
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,792
That's an internal matter.

407
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,821
No, sir, it is not.

408
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,329
Less than an hour ago,

409
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,420
I assured delegates from two dozen countries

410
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:32,006
that you were still our best hope for peace.

411
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,055
I personally guaranteed them you'd observe

412
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,451
<i>the letter and spirit of this agreement we are signing.</i>

413
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:37,853
And I will.

414
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,156
Do I have your word on that?

415
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:44,185
Madam President, within the next few hours the arrests will stop.

416
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,068
I'm taking measures to assure that.

417
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,255
And the delegate you've taken into custody?

418
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,477
Will be released or charged.

419
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:51,718
You have my word.

420
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,085
Thank you.

421
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,243
How do you think he sounded?

422
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,651
Not like himself.

423
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,029
Did he talk?

424
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:07,986
No sir.

425
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:10,642
Jamot denies all knowledge of the plot against you.

426
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,384
How forceful was the interrogation?

427
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,591
Very.

428
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,619
I did it myself.

429
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,053
I don't believe he is involved with your brother in any way.

430
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,751
You knw Jamot has connections with the extremists.

431
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:23,360
A cousin in the opposition party, sir. That's all.

432
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:31,848
He he won't talk we have to force the issue.

433
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,680
He has a wife and children back home, is that correct?

434
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,676
A boy, 9. A girl, 7.

435
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:42,432
Have the Security Services arrest them.

436
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,139
Apply whatever pressure necessary to make Jamot talk.

437
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,253
You have something to say?

438
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:03,652
Yes, sir. I do.

439
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,052
You rallied us around you on the promise that you

440
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:08,156
will put an and to such tactics.

441
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:10,452
Mr. President, I would do everything humanly possible

442
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,255
to find your brother, but please...

443
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:17,859
do not ask me to violate the principles that you and I both stand for.

444
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,608
Thank you Tarin.

445
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:31,491
With my wife gone, I have no one to speak the truth to me any more.

446
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:37,215
Check everyone's computer and phone records again.

447
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:39,018
See to it that nothing was overlooked.

448
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:40,577
Of course, sir.

449
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:42,216
Let's go.

450
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,850
Nabeel can stay and pack up these files.

451
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,183
Forget the files.

452
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,253
Sir?

453
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:06,597
Call our security services

454
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:10,823
and have them round up Jamot's wife and children as I asked.

455
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:13,227
I don't understand. You just told Tarin that--

456
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,123
I gave you a direct order.

457
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:17,292
You obey or not?

458
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:19,464
Yes, sir.

459
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,990
- I will call Security Services.
- Good.

460
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,324
And find Tarin's record in that mess.

461
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,124
He might have his own reasons for not wanting Jamot to talk.

462
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:42,102
Nick.

463
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:44,309
Nick, come on. We've got to move, man.

464
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:45,995
There is gonna be a patrol here any minute.

465
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,420
Come on.

466
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,537
- Give me the money.
- What?

467
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,486
The money, dumbass.

468
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,161
We're gonna split this.

469
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,532
I won't ask you again.

470
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,908
You can't be serious.

471
00:25:06,394 --> 00:25:07,879
Bitch. You-- Knock it off.

472
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:09,364
Come on man. Let's go.

473
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:10,611
Jackass.

474
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,661
I tolad you we should have gone.

475
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,965
Such an idiot.

476
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:23,981
I just received a call from the hazmat labatory Fort Hamilton.

477
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,658
They've analyzed the traces of uranium found on Hassan's assassin.

478
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,081
Did they identify where it came from?

479
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,829
Sample's too small to be precise,

480
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,653
but the uranium is of Soviet origin.

481
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:33,443
They're recalibrating their tests now.

482
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:36,292
Great. Keep me informed, Chloe.

483
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:42,519
Kevin, are you out of there?

484
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,479
No, not exactly.

485
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:46,634
What are you talking about?

486
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:48,344
You told me you left there 20 minutes ago.

487
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,639
Okay, yeah, we didn't.

488
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,900
Okay, now somebody's here.

489
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:51,863
You idiot!

490
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,203
Yeah, fine, all right, just hurry.

491
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,206
Somebody's in the hallway.

492
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,644
I can't believe you let this happen.

493
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,231
If you get caught, I am dead.

494
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,146
Hey, we all are.

495
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:02,953
All right, so just find us a way out of here.

496
00:26:03,281 --> 00:26:04,824
Hang on.

497
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,255
Stay calm.

498
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,919
It's a cop.

499
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:20,383
<i>He's in the hallway right outside the room you're in.</i>

500
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:23,113
There's another exit.

501
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,738
In the corner right behind you.

502
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,730
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on! Come on.

503
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,626
My God, wh... what have you done?

504
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:35,318
Damn it! It's locked!

505
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,289
He's coming inside right now.

506
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:47,087
You're going to have to slip past him,

507
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:49,128
go out the door you came in.

508
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,422
Control, this is ten post 11. I'm at the warehouse...

509
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:23,566
Nick!

510
00:27:24,123 --> 00:27:25,892
What are you doing?! No!

511
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,906
Kevin, stop him!

512
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,949
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

513
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,743
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey!

514
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,502
- Hey!
- He called it in.

515
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,075
We gotta go!

516
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,613
Come on!

517
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:38,790
- Kevin, stop him!
- Come on.

518
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,767
We'll call you when we're clear!

519
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,474
Tarin, are you all right?

520
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,174
When did you get back from the embassy?

521
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,139
Just now.

522
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,432
May I come in?

523
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:12,118
What is it?

524
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:16,765
It's only me here.

525
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,266
It's safe.

526
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,912
What's wrong?

527
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:35,160
You know your father has had many people arrested,

528
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,894
including Jamot.

529
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,318
Now he's having Jamot's wife

530
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,307
and two children detained back home,

531
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:44,019
so they can be used to force him to talk.

532
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:46,499
No.

533
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:48,321
There must be some mistake.

534
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:49,921
He gave the order himself.

535
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,687
I thought I'd convinced him not to, but

536
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:55,359
he was lying to me,

537
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,062
he went behind my back.

538
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:02,097
Kayla, your father is a great man.

539
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:06,253
I respect him more than anyone I have ever known.

540
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:09,609
But Farhad's betrayal has changed him.

541
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:11,870
What can we do?

542
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,004
Open up, please.

543
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,722
What are they doing here?

544
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,160
I don't know.

545
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,091
Open up.

546
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,159
Tarin, stay here.

547
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,232
<i>Yes, Nabeel?</i>

548
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:33,224
Miss Kayla, we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.

549
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,457
Have you seen him?

550
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,924
No.

551
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,458
Is there some problem?

552
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,593
What do you think you're doing?

553
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:42,862
We have orders, Miss Kayla.

554
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,658
I said he wasn't here.

555
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,691
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

556
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,291
You can't just barge in here!

557
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,891
I need to talk to my father!

558
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,599
Nabeel.

559
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:57,769
Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me?

560
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,068
The president says you may be involved with his brother.

561
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:01,396
Based on what?

562
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:02,091
Nothing.

563
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,449
Only that I would not allow

564
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:04,991
an innocent family to be tortured.

565
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,457
He's ordered me to detain you.

566
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,624
I have no choice.

567
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,609
You do have a choice, Nabeel.

568
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,539
Tell my father he's made a mistake,

569
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,658
that there's no one more loyal than Tarin.

570
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,334
Nabeel, this is insane, and you know it.

571
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,157
Don't make this worse, please.

572
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:19,558
Don't you see? My hands are tied.

573
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,976
Let me talk to my father.

574
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,147
He's given orders not to be disturbed.

575
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:39,792
Even by you.

576
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:44,477
I'll talk to him!

577
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,725
I'll get him to change his mind!

578
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:08,557
No, I understand, Roman.

579
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:10,625
We'll do business some other time, okay.

580
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:14,157
That's it.

581
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:15,357
Last one.

582
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:17,058
He also knows nothing about nuclear rods.

583
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,424
He also said it's suicide to deal in them.

584
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,058
Meier has wasted our time.

585
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,058
No, look, Meier's intel is good. So we need to think.

586
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:24,591
- Who else can we call?
- No one.

587
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,591
I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things.

588
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,924
Then somebody that you've already talked to

589
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:28,958
has to know something.

590
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,290
Renee, it's-it's done.

591
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,957
Look, maybe they don't want to admit it.

592
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,624
Maybe they don't know how serious you are.

593
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,290
- You should call them back.
- I said no.

594
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,924
Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money.

595
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,224
Shut up!

596
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,840
Just because I like your face doesn't mean

597
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,343
I have to put up with your crap.

598
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:42,691
We made $5 million.

599
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,891
A good night's work.

600
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,825
Why settle for five when we can have 50?

601
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,952
When did you get so greedy?

602
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,924
$5 million is plenty.

603
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:55,125
Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it?

604
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:57,791
Oh, it's not bad.

605
00:31:58,313 --> 00:31:59,859
But it could be better.

606
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,504
Call them again.

607
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,679
Do it for me.

608
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:05,591
I said no.

609
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,238
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.

610
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,697
- Somebody knows something.
- What is your problem?

611
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:11,170
Nobody knows. There's no one left to call.

612
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:13,406
Now you go out there and you tell Meier to leave, okay.

613
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:14,904
I'm not telling him anything!

614
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:16,337
What?

615
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,837
Not until you try again.

616
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:18,588
Look, it's over!

617
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,871
- What is wrong with you?!
- I need this deal.

618
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:23,788
That is why you're here? The deal?

619
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,038
Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you?

620
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,671
Get up.

621
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,670
Renee.

622
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,536
Stop! Stop!

623
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:47,971
Stop!

624
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,904
Oh, God.

625
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,372
Oh, God.

626
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,904
Oh, God.

627
00:32:58,238 --> 00:32:59,971
Oh, God!

628
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,737
It's all right. It's all right.

629
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,138
It's over.

630
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,138
It's over. It's okay.

631
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,828
Laitanan contacted everyone

632
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,162
he thought might have information

633
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,443
on the nuclear materials.

634
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:52,608
<i>No one responded.</i>

635
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:54,208
<i>That's when he said he was finished.</i>

636
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,208
Renee kept pushing him,

637
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,208
and it got ugly.

638
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,109
Laitanan's dead.

639
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,709
<i>He attacked her.</i>

640
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,208
And so, what, you took him out?

641
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:05,176
No, she did.

642
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,176
She did?

643
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,709
Half an hour earlier, she was having sex with the guy.

644
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,176
How does that even happen, Jack?

645
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,025
What, she lose it?

646
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,875
She was defending herself.

647
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,109
Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in.

648
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,851
He's violent?

649
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,875
- He's dead on the floor.
- Yes, he is.

650
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:20,787
And right, now, we still don't have the nuclear materials secured,

651
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:21,975
so I suggest we move on.

652
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,375
Move on?

653
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,176
He was our only lead, Jack.

654
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:26,642
<i>Now, where do we move on to?</i>

655
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:28,875
We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made.

656
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,309
There's also physical files here

657
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:31,742
and a computer to go through.

658
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:33,176
Yeah, fine. Cole,

659
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:34,375
<i>are you getting this?</i>

660
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,308
Yes, sir. We're en route from the staging area, five minutes out.

661
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,241
We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart.

662
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:40,088
Yeah, I got Bennett with me.

663
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,809
He can coordinate till the full team arrives.

664
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,975
Just do what you can.

665
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:45,330
And bring Laitanan's body back here for autopsy.

666
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:46,909
I want to know what the hell happened.

667
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,675
Any other good news?

668
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:50,341
Jack?

669
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:51,508
Cole?

670
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,928
Dana?

671
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:55,142
Excuse me?

672
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,228
I said, anything else?

673
00:34:57,712 --> 00:34:59,243
No, sir.

674
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:02,275
Okay, then.

675
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,143
- We'll see you when you get here.
- Yes, sir.

676
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:07,109
Our entire operation just went south.

677
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,542
You think you could show a little interest?

678
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,143
Pull it together!

679
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,328
You didn't have to do that.

680
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:27,176
Do what?

681
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:29,375
Cover for me with Hastings.

682
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,467
All I did was tell him the truth.

683
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,643
When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened.

684
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,543
What do you think happened?

685
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,608
It's like you said.

686
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,810
I couldn't handle it.

687
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:57,042
God, I'm sorry.

688
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,109
It's all right.

689
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,975
No, it's not.

690
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:01,376
I could have killed you.

691
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,177
I've made such a mess of everything.

692
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,775
I just thought that if... if I did this,

693
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,809
I could make it all right.

694
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,442
I could have my life back.

695
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,308
Hey. Hey!

696
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,842
You can have your life back any time you want.

697
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,493
You just need to want it.

698
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,909
How?

699
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:26,608
I've tried, and I don't know how.

700
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,542
I don't...

701
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:32,275
I don't have anything, anyone.

702
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,076
You've got me.

703
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,241
Okay.

704
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:40,675
Hey. Hey.

705
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:44,210
Look at me. Look at me.

706
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,210
Okay?

707
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,608
I didn't want it to end like this.

708
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,308
I know.

709
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,542
Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago.

710
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:03,848
Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead

711
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,942
that we can follow up, and that's because of you.

712
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:07,842
You did your part.

713
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:10,009
Now let CTU do their job.

714
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,875
Please?

715
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,676
Let me take you home.

716
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,398
Okay.

717
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:22,976
Okay.

718
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:26,568
Damn it, they really must have been moving.

719
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:28,142
CTU's here already.

720
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:29,875
Listen to me. This is really important.

721
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,440
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.

722
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:32,975
That's what happened.

723
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:33,907
I don't know.

724
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:35,408
I do, and if anybody else

725
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:36,975
wants to ask you questions about that,

726
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,042
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

727
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:42,208
Okay.

728
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:44,476
Let me go talk to them.

729
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:06,875
They're Russian.

730
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:09,109
Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods.

731
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,177
They just didn't want him to know.

732
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,508
Hold on to this.

733
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,341
What are you doing?

734
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:20,226
I need to let them take me.

735
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:22,110
No. We have to get out of here.

736
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,130
Listen to me.

737
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:26,875
You want everything you've done so far to matter?

738
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:27,942
I need to do this.

739
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:28,978
When CTU gets here,

740
00:38:29,013 --> 00:38:30,468
you tell them to start tracking me from the air.

741
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:31,275
These people are gonna lead us

742
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,442
to everything we're looking for.

743
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,675
They will kill you.

744
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,447
No. At worst, they're going to have to vet me,

745
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,475
find out how much I know.

746
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:39,043
It should buy us enough time.

747
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,509
Hide in here.

748
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:48,277
Take this.

749
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:50,277
If this door opens again, you start shooting.

750
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,675
Don't shoot!

751
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:07,842
Please!

752
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:08,978
I'm opening the door.

753
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,142
I'm unarmed.

754
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,909
See? Both my hands.

755
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,427
See? No problem.

756
00:39:14,462 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm unarmed.

757
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:16,076
Don't shoot.

758
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,275
What happened here?

759
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:20,642
What happened?!

760
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:21,942
They tried to rip me off.

761
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,376
- But you and I-- we can do business.
- Wait! Wait!

762
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:25,576
No! Don't shoot!

763
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:30,376
If you kill me, you're gonna cost your boss a lot of money.

764
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:33,375
Who else is with you here?

765
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,943
No one. Everybody else is dead.

766
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:40,543
All I want to do is business.

767
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:20,910
Mikhail!

768
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:30,975
Hansen, upload to CTU.

769
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:33,775
Mr. Hastings,

770
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:35,619
<i>site is secured. Video's coming through.</i>

771
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,775
<i>Three bodies. Are you getting this?</i>

772
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:39,109
Yes, we are.

773
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,508
<i>Any sign of Jack or Renee?</i>

774
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,675
No, sir.

775
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,809
I'm here.

776
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:44,750
Here.

777
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,176
It's Renee, sir. She's alive.

778
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,876
Renee, where's Jack?

779
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,575
The Russians took him.

780
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,020
The ones that have the nuclear materials.

781
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:58,942
How? We've been monitoring the building.

782
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:00,308
No vehicles left this area.

783
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:01,775
I don't... I don't know.

784
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,775
They just suddenly appeared, but...

785
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:05,109
Wait. Jack let himself be taken.

786
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,810
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air.

787
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:11,508
We haven't seen anything.

788
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,634
<i>Our drones have been overhead the whole time.</i>

789
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:15,341
<i>They saw nothing.</i>

790
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:16,810
Where is he?

791
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:20,642
<i>Where is he?</i>

792
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,375
We don't know.

793
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,509
We don't know.

794
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:44,443
Step up.

795
00:42:58,421 --> 00:43:01,507

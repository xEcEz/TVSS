4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,090
******

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,060
Have you secured the canister?

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,080
I'm afraid not,ma'am.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,880
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,850
I was told that the area was
locked down. What happened?

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,560
He had help from tony almeida.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,760
Almeida? He was working for us.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,970
It only appeared that way.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,220
Apparently he was pursuing his own
agenda,trying to get his hands on the canister.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,860
We're all regrouping to develop leads.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,170
I may have one.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,430
As hodges was taken into custody,he
yelled at me about some larger group

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,440
that would continue on after his arrest.

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,970
If that's the case,madam
president,we need to talk to him.

18
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,110
I need you to call the attorney general and draft
a witness protection agreement for jonas hodges.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,870
There's no other way he'll talk.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,520
This man mdered your son,not to
mention hundreds of innocent civilians.

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,830
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,640
Other than kill jonas hodges,no.

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,270
I didn't mean that.

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,720
You know,you're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this over the phone.

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,240
How soon can you be at thehite house?

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,670
- How's 15 minutes sound?
- Good.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,570
The plan was to launch simultaneous
attacks early next year in multiple cities,

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,270
so the public would finally see that
the government can't protect them.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,150
They'd demand drastic
measures,and we'd step in.

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,980
We were going to supply the  enemies
that want to destroy this country--

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,320
muhammad this,achmed that.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Mr. Hodges,I need the names of the
people that you are working with.

33
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,860
- I don't have any...
- I want the names!

34
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,830
I don't know any!

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,820
Another attack today is all we need
to push this thing right over the edge.

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,160
This is no time to pull back.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,130
I say we take that canister
and finish the job off today.

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,420
I'll contact the group.

39
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,800
The attack will be
attributed to this man--

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,420
jibraan al-zarian.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,170
We're talking about launching a new operation
in the next few hours and with only one canister.

42
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,560
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

43
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,680
We'd just be accelerating the timetable.

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,990
Jonas hodges was a loose cannon,and
the group is well rid of him,

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,310
but,in his lunacy,he did us a favor.

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
I say we take it.

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,050
Hamid!

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,930
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

49
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,510
- You understand?
- Yes!

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,100
******

51
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,090
How much more time do you need?

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,380
The material's almost
finished downloading.

53
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,750
Financial records are in place.

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm gonna need about another 15
minutes to alter the time stamps.

55
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,550
Good.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm gonna take this off.

57
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,010
You yell for help,you and
your brother die. Understand?

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,380
Who are you people?

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,690
You're putting jihadi
propaganda on my computer.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,630
These weapons--
you're...

61
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,740
you're trying to make me look like
a terrorist. Why are you doing this?

62
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,580
Listen to me,jibraan.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,250
There's only one thing you need to know.

64
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,070
If you d't do exactly as I say,

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,860
you're going to watch your younger
brother die right in front of your eyes.

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,430
And then... I'm gonna kill you.

67
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,540
However... if you cooperate...

68
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,910
there's a good chance the two
of you will live through this.

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,250
What do you want me to do?

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,310
First off...

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,480
you're going to read this
statement in front of a camera,

72
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,340
and you're going to
read it like you mean it.

73
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,970
No,this is insane. I can't read
this. I'm not going to do this.

74
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,170
Okay,see,that sounds to me like
you think you have a choice.

75
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,720
Please,this is not right.
You can't do this to us.

76
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,690
Okay,fine.

77
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,810
Okay,okay,please please don't hurt him.

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,680
I'll do whatever you say. Okay?

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,220
I'll give you five
minutes to look that over.

80
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,090
I just finished the first
sweep with the ctu servers.

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,890
There's been no
chatter,no activity at all.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,040
You updated the watch list?

83
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,990
Yes,everyone on that list is already
under surveillance by law enforcement.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,520
If one of them was gonna do
something,we would know about it.

85
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,560
Damn,well,we're going to
have to widen our parameter.

86
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,550
To include what?

87
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,120
I want you to check out every
muslim in the washington D.C.Area.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,050
Target anyone who's working in a sensitive
government position or in a place that might get hit.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,650
Then I want you to start pulling the files on every
political activist working in the muslim community.

90
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,310
Also,I want you to contact ins.

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,800
I want a list of every recent
immigrant from an islamic country.

92
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,730
Excuse me,has anybody
heard of racial profiling?

93
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,230
Janis,not now.

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,060
No,she's right.

95
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,190
You're right,this is racial profiling,and
I don't like it any more than you do,

96
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,560
but hodges told me specifically that he
was going to utilize muslim extremists

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,760
in an effort to offload
the blame for this attack.

98
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,460
I need to know who he's working
with,and we're running out of time.

99
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,330
I don't know a better way of doing this.

100
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,980
So if you do,please tell me now.

101
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,770
No.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,900
Okay,thank you.

103
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,090
Chloe,I need you to
run down the list of...

104
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,070
I-I'm sorry,I forgot what I was saying.

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,040
Ins records,jack?

106
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,950
Yeah,run those down first
and then work backwards.

107
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,660
Excuse me.

108
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,300
This is the second time he's done this.

109
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,790
He keeps forgetting
things,he looks like hell.

110
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,810
He's doing pretty well,considering.

111
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Considering? Considering what?

112
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,990
- He didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

113
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,240
If there's something wrong
with jack,tell me now.

114
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,420
He's sick,chloe. He was
infected with the prion variant.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,780
How?

116
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,180
He was trying to recover the bioweapon canisters
and one of them ruptured. He was exposed.

117
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,250
Oh,my god.

118
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,630
I'm sorry,chloe,he probably
didn't want you to worry. Chloe...

119
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,500
why didn't you tell me you were sick?

120
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,740
It doesn't matter.

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,540
It doesn't matter? I'm your friend.

122
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,620
We need to stay focused on finding tony.

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,460
Jack,you should be in the hospital.

124
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,780
There's no treatment for this.

125
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,970
There's no cure.

126
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,980
so you're telling me you're dying?

127
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,540
Yes.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,570
How long?

129
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,860
A day,maybe two.

130
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,630
I've been taking this anti-seizure
medicine to keep me on my feet.

131
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,490
It's been working so far.

132
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,110
Oh,my god. I'm so sorry.

133
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,600
Chloe,it's all right.

134
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,330
I've accepted it...

135
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,540
and I need you to accept it,too.

136
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,980
Whatever time I've got
left,I want it to matter.

137
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,380
We need to find tony,put an end to this.

138
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,830
chloe.

139
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,670
I can't do this without you.

140
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,090
Please,I need you to go back to work.

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,710
okay.

142
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,430
We strike this blow for our brothers and sisters
who have died at the hands of this corrupt nation.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,480
The hour is here,and we are
ready for the war that is to come.

144
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,060
Our fighters will not rest until
amica lies crippled and dying,

145
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,770
her streets running with blood,and her people
begging for mercy,but there will be none...

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,210
- only our vengeance.
- We have a problem.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,740
- What is it?
- Police.

148
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,430
Why don't you,uh...

149
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,030
close down the computer
and get out of sight.

150
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,000
Take everything down
and watch the brother.

151
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,480
- You need to come with me.
- What is happening?

152
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,950
There are two police officers outside.

153
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,870
I want you to find out what they want and
convince them that everything's okay in here.

154
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,230
jibraan...

155
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,300
don't try to warn them.

156
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,420
Dcpd. Open the door,please.

157
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Yes?

158
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,890
"Jibrain" al-zarian?

159
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,420
Jibraan al-zarian.

160
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,350
Uh,we got a call from
one of your neighbors.

161
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,960
They said they heard some yelling
coming from your apartment,

162
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,620
saw some people they didn't recognize enter the
premises,thought there might be some trouble.

163
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,060
No,everything is fine.
Those were friends of mine.

164
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,720
And what about the yelling?

165
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,740
We got into an argument.

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,400
They were drinking a little
too much. Uh,it was nothing.

167
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,990
Where are your friends now,sir?

168
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,380
you know,they got too
loud,so I asked them to leave.

169
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,830
They won't be back.

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm very sorry for the noise.

171
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,140
it won't happen again. I-I promise.

172
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,930
Okay. Just keep it down from now on.

173
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,670
I will.

174
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,050
- Have a good night.
- You,too.

175
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,500
All right,we're clear.

176
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,990
You did good,jibraan.

177
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,810
We have to finish reading this
statement before we take off.

178
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,970
Where are we going?

179
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,020
Don't worry about that.

180
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,460
You just keep doing as we say,and you and your
brother are gonna make it through this,all right?

181
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,620
Set him up.

182
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,080
And there will be
none,only our vengeance.

183
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,640
And this is only the beginning.

184
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,750
We will strike again and again in the
name of all that is great and righteous.

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,390
I think I've got something.

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,290
Agent walker? What is it?

187
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,460
One of the filters flagged this a few
minutes ago. I just finished vetting it.

188
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,890
These are multiple deposits
over a period of six months.

189
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,790
They're from an overseas muslim relief organization
called the islamic league for world peace.

190
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,270
A total of two million dollars to
the washington continental bank.

191
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,520
Every penny of it was
withdrawn within 30 minutes.

192
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,680
What name's on the account?

193
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,700
Jibraan al-zarian.

194
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,910
He's 27 years old,moved here from
pakistan on a student visa four years ago.

195
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,470
This is his personal web account.

196
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,770
These are some of the sites
he's been looking at recently.

197
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,290
We got an address on him?

198
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,930
No. This address is
false. It doesn't exist.

199
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah,his visa expired. He's here illegally,and
he probably doesn't want to be found.

200
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,850
- He does have a personal reference on his ins form.
- Who?

201
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,920
Muhtadi gohar. He lives at the
g street mosque in georgetown.

202
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,320
He's the imam there.

203
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,050
He might be able to help us find
al-zarian. We need to talk to him.

204
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,110
Put out an apb on al-zarian,run it
through the interagency database.

205
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,580
See what else you can find.

206
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,310
Fax everything over
to the car. Great work.

207
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,950
Jack,wait.

208
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,230
Are you sure you're up for this?

209
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,260
I have to see this through.

210
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,120
Please. I can help.

211
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,440
Okay. Let's go.

212
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,620
come in.

213
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,370
Ma'am,mr. Collier to see you.

214
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,300
Thank you,agent pierce. That'll be all.

215
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,210
I appreciate you coming,martin.

216
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,500
It's been a long time. You look good.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,670
Thanks.

218
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,490
So,olivia,I know why you asked
me here,but I have to tell you,

219
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,880
having me dig up dirt on
noah daniels is one thing.

220
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,860
This is a whole different animal.

221
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,710
I'm aware of that,martin.

222
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,910
I want this to happen. I want
this person taken care of.

223
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,120
- It's jonas hodges.
- Starkwood?

224
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,780
Yes.

225
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,110
What in god's name do
you have against him?

226
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,550
I don't know how much of this will get out,but
hodges was behind everything that happened today,

227
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,450
from the planes going down to
the attack on the white house.

228
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,840
- What?
- It's true.

229
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,100
He's also responsible for
the death of my brother.

230
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,700
I thought your brother killed himself.

231
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,860
He was murdered,and
hodges was responsible.

232
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,740
Okay. But why?

233
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,400
It's complicated,martin,and I
don't have time to go into it.

234
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,880
All you need to know
is,hodges worked a deal.

235
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,400
Witness protection. My mother
approved it,and he's going free...

236
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,930
unless someone intervenes.

237
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,920
Okay,can I give you a little advice?

238
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,270
- What?
- This is big game. Walk away.

239
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,950
I can't do that.

240
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,150
Once this happens,once it goes
through,you can never go back.

241
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,040
You will live with it
for the rest of your life.

242
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,850
I don't need a lecture on
conscience from you,of all people.

243
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,450
I have thought this through.

244
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,510
What I can't live with is that
monster getting away with this.

245
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,100
He has to pay for what he did.

246
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,140
So,uh,where's hodges now?

247
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,750
In fbi custody,downtown bureau.

248
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,070
Deal has been signed.

249
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,480
He's being released into witness
protection within the hour.

250
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,330
Here's his itinerary.

251
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,750
When he walks out that door,we lose him.

252
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,380
He disappears forever.
This has got to happen fast.

253
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,330
Martin.

254
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,190
All right. I'll make a call.

255
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,730
I'll get you contact information,a price,and
instructions on how to transfer the funds.

256
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,860
Thank you.

257
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,210
You'll hear from me soon.

258
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,780
mr. Hodges,this is U.S.Marshal sullivan.

259
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,870
I'm placing you in his custody.

260
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,780
He'll take you to witness protection.

261
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,940
Thank you for your
hospitality,young lady.

262
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,850
This dossier outlines your
newdentity,your new place of residence,

263
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,060
all the information you're going
to need to make this transition.

264
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,050
Robert tippett? That's my new name?

265
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,150
Yes,sir.

266
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,180
Sounds like a dog breed.

267
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,240
Our first stop is the
witt-sec facility in colorado.

268
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,600
We'll put the finishing touches on your
new biography,fabricate your new id,

269
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,200
- get you into counseling.
- Counseling?

270
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,800
It helps entrants deal with
their new circumstances.

271
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,200
Son,you know who I am.

272
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,490
Do I impress you as someone who needs
therapy to cope with new circumstances?

273
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,570
The service is available if you want
it,sir,courtesy of the american taxpayer.

274
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,310
You think I'm getting
off easy,don't you?

275
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,750
I don't think anything.

276
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,650
I can smell attitude,son,and
you're giving it off pretty thick.

277
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,440
I've lost
everything--

278
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,000
my company,my family,and
most importantly,my name.

279
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,830
Do you know how much blood and sweat
went into making that name mean something?

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,540
We leave for andrews air
force base in 30 minutes.

281
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,720
I suest you get ready.

282
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,100
Jack?

283
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm fine.

284
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,660
What are you doing? We don't even
know that they've done anything yet.

285
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,380
- They could be innocent.
- Innocent?

286
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,680
You heard hodges. They're gonna use
sleeper cells to carry out these attacks.

287
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,040
Al-zarian might not have been knowingly
complicit about everything that happened today,

288
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,910
but innocent?No.

289
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,710
Yes?

290
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,150
This is agent walker
with fbi. Mr. Gohar?

291
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,610
Yes.

292
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,130
We're sorry to bother you at such
a late hour,but we need your help.

293
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,150
My help?

294
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,870
To stop a potential terrorist attack.

295
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,320
mr. Gohar?

296
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,490
I know you.

297
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,460
My name is jack bauer.

298
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,710
Of course.

299
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,200
I watched your testimony on television.

300
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,870
Sir,can we talk to you inside?

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,810
Please.

302
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,710
what do you want?

303
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,630
We're looking for a man who worships here.

304
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,460
We believe he may be helping to plan another attack that may be happening soon,in D.C.

305
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,450
I knew the blame would eventually fall on us.

306
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,400
His name is jibraan al-zarian.Do you know him?

307
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,660
And why do you think he's a terrorist?

308
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,850
He fits a specific profile.

309
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,140
You mean,he is a muslim.

310
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,890
He's a pakistani national.His visa lapsed a year ago.

311
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,560
And he has no legal address.

312
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,230
He listed you as a personal reference on his ins form.

313
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,230
Where someone worships is private information,protected by law.

314
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,780
Right now,finding al-zarian is the only way we're going to prevent an attack against civilians.

315
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,440
So,I ask you again,sir,do you know him?

316
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,260
Look at the photo!

317
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,080
Yes,I know him.But he is not a terrorist!

318
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,650
What makes you so sure?

319
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,480
Jibraan has come to me many times for spiritual advice.

320
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,420
I know the man.

321
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,040
He is not violent and he is not an extremist.

322
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,440
We have evidence that indicates otherwise.

323
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,890
I would like to see this evidence.

324
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,720
Listen to me.We did not come here to debate this with you.

325
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,250
Where does he live?

326
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,730
-I don't know where he lives.
-Where does he work?

327
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,750
-I don't know that,either.
-And I don't believe you!

328
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,890
But you expect me to believe you?

329
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,460
I watched your hearing at the senate,I know what you have done.

330
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,210
So,tell me why should I belie anything you say to me?

331
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,870
First because you don't have a choice.

332
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,710
Second,because I am telling you the truth!

333
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,710
The truth is that you come into a house of worship with information you should not have,

334
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,820
an outrageous accusation,no legal warrant,and threaten me.

335
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I have not threatened you.

336
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,650
Not yet.

337
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,580
But we both know where this is going.

338
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,850
If you're so sure he's innocent,why are you afraid to tell us where he is?

339
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,140
-Jack...
-where is he?

340
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,410
I told you,I don't know.

341
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,150
But even if I did,I would say nothing.

342
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,750
I would not help you arrest an innocent man.

343
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,470
this is agent walker.

344
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,460
It's janis.

345
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,060
A dcpd officer recognized jibraan al-zarian from a domestic disturbance call he took 15 minutes ago.

346
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,150
The address is 2700 eastbrook,apartment 3.

347
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,730
All right,good.Coordinate with dcpd.

348
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,760
Set up an envelope and put the building under surveillance.We'll be there in 10 minutes.

349
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,000
We have an address on al-zarian.Let's go,jack.

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,320
-Turn around.
-Why?

351
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,910
I said turn around.

352
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,440
-Put your hands up,now!
-Jack?

353
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,710
What are you doing,jack?

354
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,210
I'm not letting him call al-zarian before we get there.

355
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,120
He's coming with us.

356
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,100
You have no right!I have done nothing wrong!

357
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,070
Shut up!

358
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,740
There will be none,only our vengeance.

359
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,580
And this is only the beginning.

360
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,540
We will strike again and again in the name of all that is great and righteous.

361
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,870
All right,fine.

362
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,850
The staging team's ready and waiting on us.

363
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,390
This'll be uploaded in two minutes.

364
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,110
Good.

365
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,260
Jibraan...

366
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,380
we're getting ready to move out.

367
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,690
I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother.

368
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,430
Tell him what we discussed.

369
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,530
Go ahead and wake him up.

370
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,650
Please,I can't do this.

371
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,390
Yes,you can.

372
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,100
And you will.

373
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,170
How do I know you won't kill hamid anyway?

374
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,820
Because we need him  to tell the police that his brother's a terrorist.

375
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,570
Believe me,you're saving his life by doing this.

376
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,780
Now,come on,let's go.

377
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,530
Hamid,hamid,calm down.Don't be scared.

378
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,060
Jibraan,what is this?

379
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,940
Sorry we had to do it th way.

380
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,590
But you're not going to be hurt anymore,okay?

381
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,960
We?Who is we?What's happening?

382
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,720
I'll explain everything to you,okay?

383
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,900
Who's he?

384
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,830
Um,he's a friend.

385
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,270
Your friend?I know all your friends.I've never seen him before.

386
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,560
That's because I have kept him from you.

387
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,830
What are you talking about?

388
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,870
I have to tell you something.

389
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,270
I'm not the person you think I am.

390
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,350
What?

391
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,790
I hate what this country has done to our people.

392
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,940
And I'm working with these men.

393
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,750
They're going to help me strike back against the evil that has been done to us.

394
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,840
Strike back?

395
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,420
I can't say any more than that.

396
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,600
I don't believe it.

397
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,120
This country brought us in,gave us a home,that's what you always said.

398
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,990
Yeah,that was a lie.

399
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,620
I have been protecting you from this rage I've always felt inside.

400
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,180
But now it is time for you to know the truth.

401
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,630
It was the americans who killed our parents,hamid.

402
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,830
I'm going to make them pay.

403
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,660
What have you done to my brother?You've poisoned his mind!This isn't my brother!

404
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,040
They have not done anything to me,okay.

405
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,710
It is very important you accept what I'm saying to you.

406
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,230
Why are you telling me this?

407
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,270
When they ask you why I did what I did,

408
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,040
I want you to tell them.

409
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,020
Okay,no one will blame you for anything.You have done nothing wrong.

410
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,210
I know this is very difficult for you to understand.

411
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,610
But over time,you will see.

412
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,750
I love you,hamid.

413
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,850
You said today was a bad day to be a muslim.

414
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,720
Well,it's an even worse day to be your brother.

415
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,680
All right,let's go.

416
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,180
Staging area's ready.

417
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,740
You stay here and finish up.

418
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,970
Understood.

419
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,450
Jibraan,don't do this.

420
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,720
Everything set?

421
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,370
Yeah,was the brother convinced?

422
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,710
I'm not sure.

423
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,140
But even if he wasn't,once the attack happens,he will be.

424
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,040
Let's go.

425
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,230
Hello?Hello?

426
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,640
Yes,yes,martin collier said you'd be expecting my call.

427
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,250
He gave me the target's itinerary.I'm set to go.

428
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,610
Good.

429
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,590
Good,so the terms are acceptable.

430
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,630
They are.I just need you to transfer the funds.

431
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,560
What's the account number?

432
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,440
International banking code is victor-six-bravo-one-bravo-one.

433
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,170
Account number: Zero-five-nine -nine-zero-seven-two-four-seven.

434
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,770
Ter the funds have been transferred,I'll proceed.

435
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,810
There'll be no need for us to have any further contact.

436
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,840
All right,but what e you--  hello?

437
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,280
yes?

438
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,820
Excuse me,ms.Taylor.

439
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,210
I thought you should know your father has asked to see you.

440
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,550
My father's here?

441
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:39,780
In light of the potential bioweapon attack,the president ordered him moved to the white house for his safety.

442
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,190
Thank you,aaron.

443
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,770
I just have something to take care of.

444
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,550
Tell them I'll be right there.

445
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes,ma'am.

446
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,170
You've reached martin collier.Please leave a message.

447
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,850
Martin,it's olivia taylor.

448
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,270
I spoke to the contact,but I couldn't go through with it.

449
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,510
I decided to take your advice and walk away.

450
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,030
Please call me as soon as you can.

451
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,560
-this is bauer.
-Jack,it's chloe,

452
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,620
I found something weird about these hits on jibraan al-zarian.

453
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,560
Go ahead.

454
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,780
You know how I said that the two million dollars

455
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,620
was deposited into his account over a period of six months?

456
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,690
Well,that wasn't right.They were backdated.

457
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,430
What do you mean?

458
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,460
One of the trace algorithms caught a discrepancy,

459
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,440
all that money was really just deposited 30 minutes ago.

460
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,830
What about the extremist websites he was visiting?

461
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,600
Same thing with the time stamps.

462
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,570
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

463
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,690
Are you absolutely positive?

464
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,080
It looks that way.

465
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,020
Jibraan could be innocent.

466
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,470
Okay,thanks.

467
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,470
What's going on,jack?

468
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,100
Chloe found evidence that jibraan is being set up.He's been framed.

469
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,210
Why would almeida frame an innocent man?

470
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,760
Because they wouldn't want to risk the attack not being carried out properly.

471
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,650
How could I be so stupid?

472
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,470
An innocent man is so much easier to control.

473
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,840
All they needed was a muslim,they could create whatever background they wanted.

474
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,470
god...****

475
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,020
I am surprised.

476
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,000
Why?You were right.

477
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,270
Not about jibraan.

478
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,450
My experience with the authorities,the police is that they will go to any lengths

479
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,090
not to admit they were wrong.

480
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,690
Even at the expense of an innocent man's life.

481
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,300
At least you didn't do that.

482
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,560
Please know that I forgive you.

483
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,410
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

484
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,320
Then I hope you can at least forgive yourself.

485
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,600
I gave up on that  a long time ago.

486
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,300
It's never to late to turn towards god,mr. Bauer.

487
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,600
-That's enough?
-Yeah,thanks.

488
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,340
Thank you.

489
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,380
You don't need to stay with me,ally.

490
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,090
But they know where to find me if they need me.

491
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,710
I thought it was important for you to hear what's going on.

492
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,160
And for you to understand why I did what I did.

493
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,110
You're the president,sweetheart.

494
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,270
You don't owe me an explanation.

495
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,630
There's my girl.

496
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,690
Hi,dad.

497
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,760
Livy,you can squeeze a bit harder.I won't break.

498
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,220
Oh,I might!

499
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,170
I'm sorry I couldn't come to the hospital.

500
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,080
Don't be silly.

501
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,630
You're a godsend being here helping your mom.

502
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,590
Just knowing you two were speaking again,let alone working together,that's enough.

503
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,080
Henry,I'm not sure that our détente is holding at the moment.

504
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:38,530
Olivia,your mother told me about the deal she made with jonas hodges.

505
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:46,290
And I know you,understandably,have serious concerns about that.

506
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,700
Well,I've had some time to think.

507
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,410
To put myself in mom's position.

508
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,500
To be objective and pragmatic-- the way a good leader should be.

509
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,790
Has to be.

510
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,740
I know that decision was horrible for you.

511
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,990
But I do understand.

512
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,790
I'm sorry I made thehoice even harder.

513
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,420
Jonas hodges will face judgment one day.

514
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,390
If not in this life,in the next.

515
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,690
Mr. Tippet.

516
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,970
Mr. Tippet.

517
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,780
Sorry.

518
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,780
It's going to take me a little while to get used to that.

519
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,450
Always does.

520
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,570
I'll need to confiscate the wallet.

521
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:11,210
We can't let you hold on to anything that ties you to your former life.

522
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,060
And the picture.

523
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,300
You like your job,mr. Sullivan?

524
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,140
It has its challenges.

525
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:42,480
You strike me as someone who wouldn't be totally satisfied ferrying prisoners around.

526
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,860
I don't plan on doing this my entire life.

527
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,350
Good to hear that.

528
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,850
Maybe you and I can do some work together some day.

529
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,760
Sir?

530
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,270
I don't intend to be mr. Tippet forever.

531
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,160
Sign here acknowledging transfer.

532
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,700
Fbi's identified the man they believe is going to carry out the bioweapon's attack.

533
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,550
Jack bauer and agent walker are on their way to a possible location for him.

534
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,260
Have they found out anything that would give us an idea of the target-- or a timetable?

535
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,860
No.Nothing actionable.Not yet.

536
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,020
Um,madam president.

537
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,050
This is woods.

538
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,480
Are you sure?

539
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,560
How did this happen?

540
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,550
Call me as soon as you know more.

541
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,450
What is it,tim?

542
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,540
Jonas hodges was just killed.

543
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,440
What?How?

544
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,930
Car bomb.As he was leaving fbi.

545
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,560
What else do they know?Are there any suspects?

546
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,910
Not yet.

547
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,560
Um,excuse me.

548
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,740
My guess is this was an inside job.

549
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,250
Inside job?

550
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,810
Whoever ordered the hit knew exactly when and where hodges was being transported.

551
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,120
Damn it!

552
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,820
Tim,get on top of this.

553
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,590
I want to know exactly how this happened.

554
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,630
Yes,ma'am.

555
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,110
Ms.Taylor,is everything all right?

556
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,310
Oh,it's fine.I'll be right back.

557
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,110
Yeah?

558
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,100
Hodges is dead!

559
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,360
Okay,calm down.We shouldn't be talking on the phone.

560
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,360
You don't understand,there's been a terrible mistake.

561
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,140
I spoke to the man whose number you gave me.

562
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,550
But I didn't go through with it.

563
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,250
I couldn'T.Didn't you get my message?

564
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,880
Olivia,I said calm down.

565
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,550
I can't!

566
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,100
Hodges is dead and I'm responsible.

567
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,690
We cannot have this conversation over the phone.Do you understand?

568
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,570
Do you realize what could happen to me if this gets out?

569
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,960
Olivia,you need to stop talking now.Do you hear me?

570
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,120
Take a deep breath,lien to me.All right,we'll hang up,okay?

571
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,320
All right.

572
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,740
Okay,I'm listening.

573
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,820
Can you get to pershing park?

574
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,970
No,not right now.I'm in a meeting with my mother.

575
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,030
Fine.I'll wait.Get there as fast as you can.

576
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,040
We'll talk about this face-to-face.Okay?

577
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,960
All right.

578
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,060
Thank you,aaron.

579
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,540
What do you have,agent?

580
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,830
Armed hostile in the back room,holding a hostage.

581
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,860
What about almeida?

582
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,990
He's not in there.See for yourself.

583
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,660
Reed,give us another look.

584
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,640
Yes,sir.

585
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,140
Move in closer on the hostage.

586
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,310
Is that who you're looking for?

587
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,500
No.That's jibraan's brother,hamid.

588
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,150
They're using him as leverage,to make jibraan do what they want.

589
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,030
How can you be sure?

590
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,410
'Cause that's what I would've done.

591
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,720
Agent,it is imperative that we take this hostile alive.

592
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,500
Right now,he's our only shot at finding out where this attack is going taking place.

593
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,900
Understood.I've already informed my men.

594
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,630
I want to run point on this.Is that all right?

595
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,630
Thanks.

596
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,100
You're going to stay here with the backup teams.

597
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you sure that's such a good idea?

598
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,050
What?

599
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,360
Agent bauer-- he doesn't seem to be too well.

600
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,250
Maybe you should be in charge.

601
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,050
I am.

602
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,640
Jack was infected with the bioweapon.

603
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,040
The same one that they are going to use in this attack.

604
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,310
Then he should be in the hospital.

605
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,130
There is no treatment.He probably has less than a dayo live.

606
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,400
So if he is strong enough,trust me,he's the best person for this job.

607
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,590
I'm sorry,I didn't realize.

608
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,500
Agent walker,we're ready.

609
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,080
Please,mr. Bauer,do what you can to save hamid.

610
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,030
We've checked the windows.We have a clear approach.

611
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,570
Let's go.

612
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,790
Agents,stay with mr. Gohar.

613
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,650
On my count.

614
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,240
Three...two...one.

615
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,700
Hamid,stop!

616
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,690
Put it down.We're fbi.We need him alive.

617
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,050
Put it down.He made my brother into a terrorist.

618
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,330
Your brother is not a terrorist.He's innocent.We know that.

619
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,550
He's being set up.He's being forced to do this.

620
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,990
-What?
-Please.

621
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,980
The only one who can tell us where your brother is that man right there.

622
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,990
Now put it down.

623
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,580
Stand up now,put your hands behind your head.

624
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,880
Do it!

625
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,510
Agent walker,move in now.

626
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,710
Damn it,he's bleeding out.

627
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,660
We need a medic,now!

628
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,630
We need a med team on site.

629
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,850
Sit right there.

630
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,410
Are you in their system?

631
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,340
I've tapped into the main security trunk line,

00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,520
but I'm still looping in breakers to make sure the tap doesn't get flagged.

633
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,140
All right,well,we're on a timetable here.

634
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,540
How much longer is it going to take?

635
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,480
Ten,maybe 15 minutes.

636
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,710
Hand me that case.

637
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,520
What are you going to have me do?

638
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,390
You'll find out soon enough.

639
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,710
Is the subway on schedule?

640
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,160
Yeah,it's on schedule.

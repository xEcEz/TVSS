<i>[Jack Bauer]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:19,209
You son of a bitch.
You're behind my son's death.

3
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,651
<i>[Over Speaker] Madam President,</i>
<i>I have your husband.</i>

4
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,918
You will have your forces withdrawn
from around my country, <i>Sangala...</i>

5
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,652
immediately and <i>permanently...</i>

6
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,718
<i>or your husband will die</i>
<i>a slow and certain death.</i>

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,629
I just wanted to make sure that you
were still coming to dinner tonight.

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,793
<i>Marika, I can't.</i>
<i>I'll make it up to you.</i>

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,996
<i>If you're looking for Marika,</i>
<i>she's not with me.</i>

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,098
I'm looking for you, Samuel,
or whatever your real name is.

11
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,473
Now, I don't know who you really are
and I don't care.

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,637
I just want you out of my sister's life.

13
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,620
Keep an incident quiet
until whatJack and I are doing goes down.

14
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,661
- What incident?
- Vossler's dead.

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,960
<i>Jack killed him at the hotel</i>
<i>on 18th and Reagan. It was self-defense.</i>

16
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,432
Damn it, Renee.
What the hell are you doing with this guy?

17
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,992
We're supposed to bring suspects in,
not murder them.

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,438
Until we know who Dubaku's source is,
you've got to handle this outside of the Bureau.

19
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,168
Dubaku is the only person
with the <i>names...</i>

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,039
of the people who betrayed you
within your government.

21
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,772
It's imperative that we find him.

22
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,780
You resigned from government <i>service...</i>

23
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,646
and the Senate regards you
as having been a renegade agent.

24
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,813
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

25
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,587
With all due respect,
Madam President, ask around.

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,855
<i>I got an address for Henry Taylor.</i>

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,563
Get an ambulance!

28
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:53,305
<i>[Jack Bauer] The following takes place</i>
<i>between 4:00 p.m. And 5:00 p.m.</i>

29

<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

30
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:06,190
No one else gets through here.
Follow me.

31
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,193
It's Henry Taylor,
the president's husband.

32
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,389
- But that information is not
to be disseminated. Clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,436
- L-
- Mr. Taylor, don't speak.

34
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,169
I need you to save your energy.

35
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,904

36
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,780
Over here!

37
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,112
Excuse me.
Step back, please!

38
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,620
This is Unit Six.
We got a gunshot trauma to the chest.

39
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,655
- Nine-millimeter round.
- Nine-millimeter, substernal.

40
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,384
- Pulse is rapid.
- You okay?

41
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,289
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call the president.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,157
<i>I want you to search all the rooms.</i>

43
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,720
See if you can get anything off their hardware
that's gonna tell us where Dubaku went.

00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,569
- I need to speak with the president.
- One moment, please.

48
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,640
Madam President,
I would encourage you not to lose hope.

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,081
Dubaku knows that we tried to deceive him,
Ethan. He has no reason to keep Henry alive.

50
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,381
- <i>[Intercom Beeping]</i>
- <i>[Woman] Madam President,</i>
<i>Jack Bauer's on line one.</i>

51
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,114
Put him through.

52
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,918
Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,981
Madam President,
we have your husband.

54
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,222
He's alive, but he sustained
a gunshot wound to the chest.

55
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,321
How bad is it?

56
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,059
E.M.T. Are stabilizing him.

57
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,101
They're getting ready to transfer him
to West Arlington Hospital.

58
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:26,571
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.
Is my husband going to be okay?

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,766
We're not gonna know anything
until the doctors see him.

60
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,241
<i>Ma'am, I have to warn you.</i>
<i>He has lost a lot ofblood.</i>

61
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,279
Jack, it's Bill.
Do you have Dubaku?

62
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,280
Negative.
He was gone before we got here.

63
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,010
Madam President, since your husband
was the only leverage that Dubaku had <i>left...</i>

64
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,518
it's safe to say that he's
trying to leave the country now.

65
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,454
Have you any idea
how he intends to do that?

66
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,151
Not at this time. Unfortunately,
all his men were killed during the assault.

67
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,320
<i>Agent Walker and I will stay behind.</i>
<i>We'll continue to search the area.</i>

68
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,421
We have to assume that Dubaku
has an exit strategy already in place.

69
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,433
Whatever we're gonna do to find him,
we're gonna have to do it fast.

70
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,993
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

71
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,438
Please keep me apprised
on everything.

72
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,532
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

73
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,373
[Beeps]

74
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,113
<i>I am so sorry, Madam President.</i>

75
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,945
Ethan, I'm going to the hospital
to be with my husband.

76
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,615
Ma'am, that's not possible.

77
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,624
You're executing a military invasion.

78
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,559
My generals can execute it
perfectly well without me.

79
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,190
We can't ignore the fact the Secret Service
has been compromised.

80
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,326
There's no way we can ensure your safety
outside the White House.

81
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,701
I don't give a damn.
I am not gonna be held prisoner in this <i>office...</i>

82
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,706
while my husband is fighting for his life.

83
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:39,143
Now either find someone to take me
to the hospital, or I'll drive there myself.

84
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,409
Madam President, you know
my record of service.

85
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,043
<i>If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing</i>
<i>to assume responsibility for your security.</i>

86
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,350
<i>Bill, you're no longer credentialed.</i>
<i>You don't have the authority.</i>

87
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,322
Until we capture Dubaku
and interrogate <i>him...</i>

88
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,417
we have no idea who in the government
is working for him.

89
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,157
- You do not know who you can trust.
- But I can trust you?

90
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,064
I brought this conspiracy
to your attention, Madam President.

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,068
I would hope that I've earned it.

92
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,502
What do you need from me?

93
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,369
Reinstate my government <i>clearance...</i>

94
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,035
allow me the authority
to vet White House <i>staff...</i>

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,204
<i>and allow me to bring one</i>
<i>of my own people into F.B. I...</i>

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,373
to provide Larry Moss
with tactical support.

97
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,940
- Who is it that you want to bring in?
- Chloe O'Brian.

98
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,452
I can vouch for her.
She's the best there is.

99
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,388
Her clearances were also revoked
when C.T.U. Was decommissioned.

100
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:29,019
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these
duties without our having to reinstate her?

101
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:33,225
Someone in the Bureau is on Dubaku's payroll.
Until we find out who it <i>is...</i>

102
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,860
Larry Moss can't take the chance of bringing
his own people into a manhunt for Dubaku.

103
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,965
All right.

104
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,531
The director of White House
Secret Service operations is Agent Hovis.

105
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,169
I'll order him to turn over
security protocols to you.

106
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,237
I know Ted Hovis, Madam President.
He's not gonna like this. He's gonna fight us.

107
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,751
Considering that agents
under his charge are responsible
for what happened to my <i>husband...</i>

108
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,083
I don't give a damn what he likes.

109
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,090
<i>You have your provisional appointment, Mr.</i>
<i>Buchanan, under the authority of this office.</i>

110
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,218
- Thank you, Madam President.
- You can thank me by getting me to the hospital.

111
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
I'll make the arrangements.

112
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,892
- Madam President-
- Your concerns are clear to me,
but I've made my decision.

113
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,903
I'm only trying to do my job,
looking out for your interests.

114
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,634
My interest right now
is catching Iké Dubaku.

115
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,074
<i>He has killed scores of Americans today...</i>

116
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,477
he tried to kill my husband,
and he has corrupted our government.

117
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,983
Whatever it takes,
I want that son of a bitch found.

118
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,484
[Whispering]
Marika! Marika!

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,687
- Samuel? What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

120
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,530
- Uh, okay. Well, I get a break in 20 minutes.
- No, now.

121
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,538
- Come.
- What is it? You're scaring me.

122
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,506
Uh, something has come up.

123
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,599
I need to leave the country.

124
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,644
- What? When?
- Right away.

125
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,647
I don't understand.
When are you coming back?

126
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,650
Marika, listen to me.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

127
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,950
My passport visa expired a couple of months ago,
and I've been in the country illegally.

128
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,458
I'm afraid the Immigration people
have caught up with me.

129
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,960
It was my sister, wasn't it?

130
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,519
- She reported you, didn't she?
- That doesn't matter now.

131
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,363
What is important is, I have to leave the country
tonight and I want you to come with me.

132
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,700
- Tonight?
- Marika, we've talked about this.

133
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,968
I promised that one day I would take you away
from here, give you the happiness you deserve.

134
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,875
Samuel, I want that too, but-
but not tonight, not so soon.

135
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,937
Marika! Marika, I don't
have time to argue with you!

136
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,619
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
I can't leave Rosa.
I mean, she needs me.

138
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm the only one she has to take care of her.
You know that.

139
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,253
I know. I know.

140
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,023
- Which is why she's going to join us.
- Join us?

141
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,030
As soon as possible.

142
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,658
I could only arrange tickets
for both of us tonight.

143
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,295
But I want you to promise not to
tell your sister of our plans, at least not yet.

144
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,033
- I have to. I can't just run off.
- No. No, no.

145
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,167
She might cause trouble for us,
make it impossible for us to leave.

00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:02,010
Look, I promise <i>you...</i>

147
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,346
your sister will join us within
a couple of days of our arrival.

148
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,750
- Okay?
- Our arrival where?

149
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,755
Belize. I have shown you
the photographs of my home there.

150
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,093
Do you love me?

151
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,790
You know I do.

152
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,631
Then trust me.
Say you'll come.

153
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,730
I'll get my things.

154
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,844
Now, I still need to
finalize our arrangements.

155
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,349
I want you to go home and pack.
Wait for my call.

156
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,817
All right.

- Yes?

159
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,331
It's me. Have you
made the preparations?

160
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,164
Almost. It's been tricky
clearing a flight <i>corridor...</i>

161
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,000
since F.A.A. Still has most private
and commercial aircraft grounded.

162
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,199
I have faith you'll manage.

163
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,301
- The arrangements are for two passengers.
- Just as you requested.

164
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,812
Are you sure you want
to leave now, Colonel?

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,281
Can't imagine GeneralJuma will be pleased
to learn that you're abandoning your mission.

166
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,046
Mission is over.
I have done what I can do.

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,782
If that is not enough forJuma,
then to hell with him.

168

Got your passports

We meet at our usual spot in half an hour.
I'll bring them.

00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,799
No. We meet in the lobby of
the Roosevelt Continental Hotel.

171
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,768
That's not a good idea.
It'll be crowded there at this hour.

172
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,101
I know.
I want to make it earlier.

- Yeah?
- Renee, it's me.

181
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,467
Bill Buchanan just briefed me on your situation.
What's Henry Taylor's status?

182
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,061
We got him in an ambulance
en route to West Arlington Hospital.

183
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,072
I don't know his current condition.

184
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,199
Buchanan told me
you and Bauer were in a firefight.

185
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,269
Yeah. We took down six of Dubaku's men,
but Dubaku was gone before we got there.

186
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,872
- You all right?
- Been in worse.

187
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,342
You sure?

188
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,655
- I'm fine, Larry.
- Really?

189
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,486
I'm not so sure about that.

190
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,651
And what is that
supposed to mean?

191
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,356
I'm looking at a report
faxed to me from Metro Police.

192
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,059
A Mrs. Carol Vossler is claiming
an unidentified <i>woman...</i>

193
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,194
held her and her child
hostage at gunpoint.

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,535
- She says the woman threatened to kill her son.
- Larry, we discussed this.

195
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,907
We needed to get Vossler to tell us where Taylor
was being held. It was the only leverage we had.

196
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,912
Yeah. Right.
Whatever's necessary.

197
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,006
Jack Bauer's rationalization for
every unethical action he takes.

198
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,244
Well, it worked, Larry.
Doesn't that count for something?

199
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,913
Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be strung up
by a Senate <i>subcommittee...</i>

200
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,922
and you are following his playbook.

201
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,925
You got the A.G. Office looking into that thing
you pulled with Tanner's respirator.

202
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,190
- And now this.
- No one was actually hurt.

203
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,924
- No one-
- <i>[Slaps Desk]</i>

204
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,193
Renee, Bauer killed the woman's husband!

00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,202
Renee, I swear to you <i>here...</i>

206
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,204
I am scared
of what is happening to you.

207
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,901
You put these people through hell,
and it doesn't bother you.

208
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,537
I didn't say that it doesn't bother me, Larry.
I said that it worked.

209
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,138
Of course it bothers me.

210
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,416
I can see that woman's <i>face...</i>

211
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,014
she and her child
staring at me with such-

212
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,083
She had no idea that her husband
was a killer, a traitor to his <i>country...</i>

213
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,959
and she looked at me
like <i>I was the monster.

214
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,157
- Agent Walker.
- Hold on.

215
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,598
<i>I cross-referenced the</i>
<i>information on these P.D.A.'s.</i>

216
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,329
I came some across
banking transactions-

217
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,497
all from a series of accounts
registered to the same address.

218
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,666
- You think it's a safe house?
- It's worth a shot.

219
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,801
Larry, we may have
an address on Dubaku.

220
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,313
21917 Euclid Street,

We're moving out now.
Can you provide sat surveillance?

223
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,345
Yeah. Bill Buchanan's sending
somebody over to run tech.

224
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,482
But until she's up and running,
you're gonna have to go in blind.

225
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,652
- Okay. We'll be in touch.
- You sure you're okay?

226
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,923
Fine.

<i>it has been quite a journey to this moment.</i>

233
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,191
<i>I had no idea that what I started</i>
<i>would end up here.</i>

234
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,388
[Pam] You were telling us earlier
that this just <i>started...</i>

235
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,193
<i>as gathering recipes and traditions that</i>
<i>you remembered when you were growing up.</i>

<i>[Lila] That's right. You know,</i>
<i>I was trying to tell my children...</i>

237
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:55,163
<i>as I would make them lunch, I was reminded</i>
<i>of where did this recipe come from.</i>

<i>Then as I did that, I remembered,</i>

not gonna need my help?

247
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,235
I'm just running F.B.I. Ops temporarily
until they catch Dubaku.

248
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,332
Once they find him,
hopefully he'll tell us the <i>names...</i>

Well, just be careful.
All right?

252
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,181
<i>Because if Buchanan's right and Dubaku</i>
<i>has someone working inside the Bureau-</i>

253
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,419
I'll watch my back.
You just watch Prescott.

Hey, sweetheart, Mommy has to go to work.

All right, go ahead.

261
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,281
Need you to cross-reference
our deployments with Homeland.

262
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,286
Make sure the
requisition numbers match up.

263
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,788
- After that, you can catch up on the hourlies.
- Are you joking?

264
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,189
That is busy work,
administrative crap you're handing me.

265
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,457
Janis, I don't have the time nor the inclination
right now to explain my assignments to you.

266
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,191
- Just get it done.
- <i>Agent Moss.</i>

267
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,462
- Chloe O'Brian just cleared security.
She's on her way up.
- All right. Thank you.

268
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,231
Janis, set up a secure V.P.N. Socket,
port it to the conference room.

269
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,135
Why do you need a V.P.N. Socket?

270
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,833
I'm bringing in
a consultant from <i>Homeland...</i>

That's fine.
Take that downstairs.

00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,243
Ms. O'Brian. Larry Moss.

274
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,250
- Welcome to the F.B.I.
- Hi.

275
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,980
- You can call me Chloe.
- We're right in here.

276
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,992
- Buchanan said you'd be up to speed?
- I'm up.

277
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,329
Good. Agent Walker and Bauer
are pursuing a potential lead on Dubaku.

278
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,966
They're en route to this address
in the Mount Pleasant district.

279
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,802
Agent Walker's
requesting satellite support.

280
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,210
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

281
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,212
I'm feeling a little exposed here.

282
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,340
If someone out there is working for Dubaku,
shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?

283
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,214
As far as anyone knows,
you're working on shoring up our firewall.

284
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,983
Besides, this is the only space available
where you'll have full access to our server.

285
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,355
- Our network doesn't support remote modules.
- That's inefficient.

286
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,054
Whoever set your network up that way
didn't know what they were doing.

287
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,823
I set our network up that way.

288
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,959
Oh. Okay.

289
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,546
Something else?

290
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,515
You worked with Bauer
for a long time, didn't you?

291
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,211
Seven years, on and off.

292
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,516
That's impressive.

293
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,015
That you survived the experience.

294
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,721
- What are you talking about?
- Only that a lot of people didn't.

295
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,357
Curtis Manning,
Ryan Chappelle, his own wife.

296
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,199
Are you saying it's Jack's fault
his wife was killed?

297
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,568
You tell me.

298
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,870
Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy,
honorable man I know, and he's my friend.

299
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,877
Maybe you should worry less about him
and more about the mole in your <i>office...</i>

300
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,936
working for Dubaku.

301
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,262
Is that Chloe O'Brian?
- What?

302
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,127
In the conference room-
Chloe O'Brian.

303
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,565
<i>She was senior analyst at C.T.U.</i>

304
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,228
I once took a seminar she gave.
What's she doing here?

305
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,172
Larry said Homeland sent her to check for
residual breaches from the firewall attack.

306
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,175
- Huh.
- <i>What?</i>

307
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,178
It just doesn't sound
like her area of expertise.

308
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,613
Besides, as far as I know, she's been inactive
since C.T.U. Was decommissioned.

309
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,890
Passports and travel itinerary.

310
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,127
Hawker Siddeley 748
is fueling at Taft Airfield.

311
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,001
Be ready to fly within a half hour,
get you to the Cayman Islands.

312
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,438
Shouldn't have any trouble
getting to Belize from there.

313
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,499
I need a car to the airfield
and a driver.

314
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,510
I assumed you had
your own transportation.

315
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,605
- It's not for me.
- I see. It's for the girl.

316
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,186
Well, I'm not sure I can find
someone I trust on such short notice.

317
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,449
Really?

318
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,152
- What about your man at the bar?
- Excuse me?

319
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,286
Or one of the two
on the balcony watching us now?

320
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,298
<i>Or the two in the black Town Car,</i>
<i>waiting for me to leave?</i>

321
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,800
Do you think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burnett?

322
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,803
I know you people
see me as a liability now.

323
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,102
These men are here to guarantee
your safety, Colonel, not to threaten it.

324
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,609
Guarantee my safety.

325
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,043
How nice.
[Chuckles]

326
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,047
And said with such sincerity.

327
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,511
I want you to take this message
back with you.

328
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,319
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country-

329
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,692
an accident or an assassination attempt,
anything-

330
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,063
the plane that you were so generous
to donate decides to explode-

331
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,069
a data file with all the names
and bank transactions of all those <i>involved...</i>

332
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,537
will be sent to theJustice Department.

333
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,540
That is completely unnecessary.

334
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,543
Same holds true if anything
should happen to Marika Donoso.

335
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,705
I swear to you she knows nothing of this.
She's no threat to you.

336
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,545
Make sure your driver knows this
before he brings her to me.

337
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,916
Do you understand
what I am saying?

338
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,921
I want you to tell me
that you <i>understand...</i>

339
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,685
what I am saying to you,
so there will be no mistakes.

340
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,318
- I understand.
- Good.

341
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,598
The one thing I have learned in the company
of mercenaries, Mr. <i>Burnett...</i>

342
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,864
is that ultimately they care about nothing
but their own survival.

343
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,768
Good day.

344
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,177
- [Line Ringing]
- I was right. Dubaku suspected
we were gonna take him out.

345
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,519
And apparently he's assembled evidence
to use as an insurance policy.

346
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,785
We need to make sure
he gets out of the <i>country...</i>

347
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,918
and safely into exile,
otherwise we're all compromised.

348
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,520
I'll make the calls.

349
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,792
<i>What are you doing?</i>

350
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,306
- Rosa.
- Where are you going?

351
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,902
Rosa, listen to me.
We're going away from here, all of us.

352
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,538
[Scoffs]
Well, what do you mean, "all"?

353
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,640
Samuel told me the truth.

354
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,777
He's an illegal,
<i>just like you thought.

355
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,051
He has to leave the country,
and I've agreed to go with him.

356
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,628
- You're leaving me?
- No, no. Only for a short time.
You're gonna come too.

357
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,632
Samuel's made plans. We're gonna
live with him in his home in Belize.

358
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,067
Marika, he's lying to you.

359
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,935
- He's not.
- I won't let you do this!

360
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:12,500
My God, Rosa!
I have taken care of you my entire life!

361
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,739
<i>I've sacrificed everything for you.</i>

362
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,475
- Why can't you let me have this?
- I don't trust him!

363
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,848
Well, you've never liked any man
who's ever shown any interest in me.

364
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,013
<i>Every chance I've ever had at happiness,</i>
<i>you've found some way of ruining it.</i>

365
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,956
- But not this time.
- Marika, I'm begging you. Listen to me.

366
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,993
- No.
- Marika, please. Stop.

367
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,723
- Move!
- Marika, please.

368
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,856
Listen to me.
I'm begging you, Marik-

369
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,493
- F.B.I. Don't move!
- Get on your knees now! On your knees!

370
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,596
Both of you, put your hands behind
your head and interlock your fingers! Now!

371
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,436
Do not move!

372
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,106
We're clear.

373
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,478
- Where is Dubaku?
- Who?

374
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,814
Don't play games with me! Iké Dubaku!
We traced bank accounts to this address.

375
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,651
- Now, where is he?
- We don't know wh-who you talking about.

376
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,886
Let me try and make this easier for you.
You know this man?

377
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,123
No.

378
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,961
You're lying to me.
Why are you lying to me?

379
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,660
L-Let me see.

380
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,236
That's him.
We know him.

381
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,502
He calls himself Aboa.
Samuel Aboa.

382
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,136
- Rosa, shut up!
- She was going to meet him to leave me.

383
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,080
- Where were you gonna meet him?
Where were you going?
- I don't know.

384
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,709
- How do you know him? You work for him?
- No.

385
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,185
- Do you work for him?
- No.

386
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,414
You know what he's doing here
in this country?

387
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,424
Do you have any <i>idea...</i>
<i>what</i> this man is?

388
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,399
He's everything to me.

389
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,245
<i>[Beeping]</i>

390
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,714
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Notify C.P. Iocation. Will hold.</i>

391
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,783
Once the floor's secure.

392
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,730
- Nurse-
- Mitchell.

393
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,464
Nurse Mitchell, I'd like to see my husband.

394
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,904
Ma'am, I don't know if that's possible.

395
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,965
I was told that Dr. Schulman
will be doing the surgery. Where is he?

396
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,977
<i>Excuse me, Madam President.</i>

397
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,138
I'm Lee Schulman,
your husband's surgeon.

398
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,615
If you come with me you can see him now,
but you'll need to keep it brief.

399
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,618
Thank you.

400
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,917
You should know Mr. Taylor's looking
at a minimum of five hours in surgery.

401
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,923
The bullet lacerated
his pulmonary <i>artery...</i>

402
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,925
and lodged in his thoracic region.

403
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,427
He's also suffered
massive internal bleeding.

404
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,930
Can you offer any kind of prognosis?

405
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,394
I'm a blunt woman, Dr. Schulman.
I appreciate bluntness.

406
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,166
His chances aren't good, <i>ma'am...</i>

407
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,503
but I'll do everything I can.

408
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,669
If you'll excuse me,
I need to scrub up now.

409
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,919
<i>Henry!</i>

410
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,114
- Darling, can you hear me?
- Ally.

411
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,783
Yes, sweetheart.

412
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,793
I'm here.

413
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,352
I'm so sorry I didn't listen
to you about Roger.

414
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,264
You were right. It wasn't suicide.
I know that now.

415
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,268
You were always right.

416
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,601
- [Moans] He was a hero.
- Yes.

417
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,869
He was.
And so are you.

418
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,469
<i>I'm sorry, Madam President,</i>
<i>but the anesthesiologist is ready now.</i>

419

- <i>[Monitor Beeping]</i>
- <i>[Woman On P.A. Mr. Carlisle, Admitting.</i>

<i>come to Admitting, please.</i>

00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,373
Yes, Madam President?

423
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,881
There's something
I need you to do for me.

424
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,748
Have someone find my daughter Olivia
and bring her to me.

425
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,887
Have you had a chance to tell her?

426
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:23,023
My daughter and I haven't spoken
for some time, Mr. Buchanan.

427
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,086
She'd never get on the phone with me.

428
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,333
She works for a consulting firm-
Martlin Norris.

429
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,340
Do you have someone trustworthy
you can send?

430
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,506
Yes, ma'am. I believe I do.

431
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,321
And here he is again,
in the uniform of the presidential <i>guard...</i>

432
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,381
at the gates of
the notorious Mukatu Prison.

433
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,452
And here, inside the soccer stadium
after the Barakar <i>Massacre...</i>

434
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,557
<i>the event that earned him the nickname</i>
<i>the Butcher of Sangala.</i>

435
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,727
Oh, please.
No more.

436
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,236
What did you say
his real name was again?

437
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,300
<i>Dubaku.</i>

438
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,370
Iké Dubaku.

439
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,483
I've seen firsthand
what he's capable of.

440
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:24,818
<i>I was in Africa a few months ago. He was</i>
<i>responsible for murdering a friend of mine.</i>

441
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,017
Oh, God.

442
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,060
I know this is a <i>shock...</i>

443
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,290
<i>and I'm sorry, I really am.</i>

444
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,094
But here's the situation-
we need your help and we need it now.

445
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,067
- [Sobbing]
- What kind of help?

446
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,435
We need to put this man in custody
before he can leave the country.

447
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,440
She already told you
she doesn't know where he is.

448
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,342
You said earlier that you
were gonna meet him. Where?

449
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:52,406
He didn't say. Just told me to go home
and pack and wait for his call.

450
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,315
Give me your phone.

451
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,513
- Why?
- When he calls, I want you to answer.

452
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,356
- No. No, no. I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

453
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:07,330
- [Gasping]
- Listen to me. Just listen to me.

454
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,663
<i>L- It's over.</i>

455
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,967
The man you thought you knew,
the man you had feelings for, he doesn't exist.

456
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,601
<i>All you've been left with</i>
<i>are his lies and his betrayal.</i>

457
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,271
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

458
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,213
Is that him?

459
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,910
- [Sobbing, Gasping]
- Marika, please.

460
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,920
All I want you to do is answer
the phone and talk to <i>him...</i>

461
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,650
so that we can find out
where he wants to meet you.

462
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,658
- <i>Please, you can do this.</i>
- <i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

463
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,887
Please just try.

464
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,960
- [Beeps]
- Hello?

465
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,027
- [Dubaku] Marika?
- Yes.

466
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,403
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

467
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,170
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

468
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,110
I was in the bedroom, packing.
Where are you?

469
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,614
What's wrong?
You sound strange.

470
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,616
It's- It was Rosa.

471
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,050
She caught me packing
and we argued.

472
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,714
- Is she going to be a problem for us?
- No!

473
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,088
I'm sorry, Samuel.
I had to tell her everything.

474
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,959
It was the only way.
But, uh- But she understands now.

475
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,964
- Are you certain?
- Yeah.

476
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:18,969
Yeah, she's fine, now that she knows
she and I will be together again in a few days.

477
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:23,269
Hmm. She should thank heaven
she has such an angel for a sister.

478
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,866
- Are you ready to go?
- Almost.

479
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,539
Hurry up then. I've had a car sent for you.
It should be there very shortly.

480
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,548
Go downstairs and wait for it.

481
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,518
- Where is it taking me?
- Don't worry. The driver will know.

482
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:39,853
I just want the woman I love
to get downstairs as quickly as possible.

483
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,915
Okay.

484
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,427
[Beeps]

485
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,430
[Gasps, Sobs]

486
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,728
It's all right.
It's all right.

487
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,291
- <i>You did great.</i>
- <i>Did we get the rendezvous point?</i>

488
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,304
No. He's sending a car
with a driver.

489
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,363
Come here.

490
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,937
[Chattering]

491
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,948
There's no one on the street yet.

492
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,610
We could grab the driver,
get him to tell us Dubaku's location.

493
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,620
There's no guarantee
we can get him to <i>talk...</i>

494
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,952
and if we take too long,
Dubaku's not gonna wait around.

495
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,014
So then what do we do?

496
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,289
We can get her to go meet with him.

497
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,423
What?

498
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,434
We could track her. We could use
her cell phone as a transponder.

499
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,335
- You want to send that girl to Dubaku?
- We don't have another choice.

500
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,238
- Jack.
- You want to get Dubaku? This is our shot.

501
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,672
<i>Marika...</i>

502
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,184
I have a favor to ask of you.

503
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,155
We can't make you do this,
but when the car <i>arrives...</i>

504
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,785
we would like you to go with the driver
so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.

505
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,456
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>You want her to go to him and face him?</i>

506
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,967
It's the only chance we have of finding him
before he disappears forever.

507
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,969
I'll do it.

508
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:03,872
- I'll do it.
- <i>No! I'm your older sister,</i>
<i>and I won't allow it!</i>

509
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,878
It's not your decision
to make, Rosa. It's mine.

510
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,505
And it's the right thing to do.

511
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,612
Let me see your phone.

512
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,726
- What are you doing?
- Getting your S.I.D. Number.

513
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,853
That's how we're gonna track you.
You're not gonna be out there alone.

514
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,160
Agent Walker and I will be following you.
We'll never be more than a mile behind.

515
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,794
As soon as you reach the destination,
that's when we'll move in.

516
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,328
<i>Marika, a mile.</i>
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

517
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,340
Rosa, enough.

518
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,638
<i>You heard what he said!</i>
<i>He's a murderer!</i>

519
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,645
- He could hurt you!
- He won't.

520
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,171
Rosa, I should've listened to you.

521
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,879
- Sweetheart.
- You warned me about him.

522
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:53,549
Listen, the only reason why I said those things
was because I was <i>jealous...</i>

523
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,752
and I didn't want to lose you.

524
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,657
Larry, this is Jack. Renee said you had
someone running operations support?

525
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,668
- Yeah, she's right here. I'll put you on speaker.
- [Beeps]

526
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,567
Jack, it's Chloe.

527
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,299
- Chloe.
- What do you need?

528
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,342
How long's it gonna take you
to set up a sat beacon for a mobile line?

529
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,037
Usually a few seconds, but with
the backward way they have this system set <i>up...</i>

530
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,773
it's gonna take at least a few minutes.

531
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:21,046
Okay. Let me give you the S.I.D. Number:
1 -C-4-8-6-8-9.

532
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,053
- You got it?
- Got it.

533
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,055
Jack, who are you tracking?

534
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,889
A woman who's involved with Dubaku.
He's sending a car to take her to him.

535
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,121
- She's one of his operatives?
- No.

536
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,630
It's more complicated than that.

537
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,977

for a relatively small
pharmaceutical company like yours.

543
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,745
Remember, my firm helped
the governor craft a <i>plan...</i>

544
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,839
to swap property taxes for sales taxes
in his last budget reform.

545
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,441
Tell me that didn't save

Oh, it did, Olivia.

547
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,149
But since I'm specifically looking to hire you,
I need to know what you yourself can do.

548
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,751
Whatever you need. You know my
accomplishments. You've seen my résumé.

We're not lobbyists, Arthur.
It states that clearly in the contract.

I just thought since
you have the president's ear-

553
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,833
I don't. Is that
going to be a problem?

Your office told me you'd be here.

I've been dispatched

Your credentials say
you've retired, Mr. Pierce.

560
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,023
Perhaps no one informed you I refused
Secret Service protection months ago.

561
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,552
I'm aware of that, ma'am.
This is a special circumstance.

Well, as you can see,
I'm a little busy right now.

- I'm sorry, but I have to insist.

- Really, it's all right.
- No.

No, it's not all right.

What is it that's so important for my mother to
steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

567
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,483
I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am.
That information is confidential.

568
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,212
Olivia, we can pick this up
at a later time.

- Arthur, wait. It-
- We'll be in touch.

Ma'am, please.

I'm not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what this is about.

572
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,901
It's your father, Ms. Taylor.

573
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,904
He's been shot.

574
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,601
He's in surgery at West Arlington Hospital.
Your mother's there now.

575
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,269
None of this is public knowledge.

Excuse me, Sean. Can I please
get the digital beta key for the server?

580
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,456
Why?

581
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,931
Larry asked for it. Something to do
with the firewall assessment.

582
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,698
- If Larry wants it, why doesn't he come to me?
- I don't know.

583
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,104
- Maybe I oughta go ask him.
- No.

584
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,811
Okay.

585
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,905
I think that Larry brought in this woman,
Chloe O'Brian, to replace <i>me...</i>

586
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,917
and I just want to get a bead

He's got a canister of the bioweapon.

- They didn't give me a lot.

- I know that, and so does he.

But it's a slim one,
and he believes it's not worth taking.

104

149

He was interrogating a mercenary.

150

- Did Almeida give you a name?
- Um-

Yeah. Sorry.

152
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,886
Car- Cardiff.
He said his name was Vincent Cardiff.

153
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,930
Did you, yourself, question this source?

154
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,489
No. He didn't survive Tony's interrogation.

155
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,003
But he was the one who provided us
with the intel on the upcoming attack.

But we did not know that the White House

the bullet might have nicked the splenic artery.

- Will that be a problem?

Hopefully it'll just pressure him to resolve
the situation sooner rather than later.

I'll be happy when this is behind us.

Yeah, I got lucky.
The bullet went right straight through.

- How the hell did this happen?
- It all went down pretty fast. I mean-

331
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,433
We were ambushed
before we got out of the helicopter.

332
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,872
The chopper pilot was hit <i>first...</i>

333
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,106
and I was unarmed,
so Larry laid down cover so I could get clear.

334
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,615
I don't remember a lot,
but I definitely heard auto fire.

335
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,354
Once I was tagged, Larry came over
to help me out, and that's when he was hit.

336
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,950
I blacked out after that,
but I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life.

337
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,485
Larry was hit with heavy ordnance-
shotgun rounds, armor-piercing.

338
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,725
You obviously were hit
with something smaller-jacketed.

339
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,099
<i>I treated Mr. A lmeida. His wound</i>
<i>was consistent with a nine-millimeter.</i>

340
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,607
- You sure it wasn't a.45?
- <i>Not likely. The entry was too small. Why?</i>

341
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,643
Because you have
spent.45 casings in evidence.

342
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:37,273
Galvez had access to the weapons inside
the F.B.I. Vehicle he stole.

343
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,340
He probably switched
in the middle of the fight.

344
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,819
That many weapons? In the time frame
that you described the ambush?

I guess it makes sense.

He was exposed to something,

<i>Just stop and listen to what you're sayin'.</i>
<i>It's insane.</i>

591
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,520
It's paranoia.
Now, why don't you put the gun down?

592
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,117
Don't you move!

593
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,527
The toxin's starting to affect your judgment.

I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.

I told you to stay out of it,
but you wouldn't listen, would you?

00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,329
Can we get some help here?
This man's havin' a seizure.

Stand back, please.

Go get my bag, and call Dr. Macer, stat.

I don't see anything.
The wound must be posterior.

Sir, I need to turn you on your side.

609

Put it down. Keep driving. Now!

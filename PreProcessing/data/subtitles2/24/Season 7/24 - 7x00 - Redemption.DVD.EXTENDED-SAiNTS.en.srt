157
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,500
that your recruiting numbers
are-- are still coming up
a little short.

158
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,133
I want you to know
my offer stands.

159
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,367
I've got personnel standing by
right across the border.

160
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:45,467
They can be deployed
within the hour.
That won't be necessary.

161
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,467
Oh?

162
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,533
Do some thinking now,
Colonel.

163
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm offering you professional
soldiers, not children you
haven't had time to train.

164
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,966
You provided the weapons.
We will fight our own war.

165
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:00,033
Well, it's your country.

166
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
It will be, soon.

167
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
Is there anything else,
Mr. Hodges?

168
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,533
Yeah.
Uh, tell General Juma...

169
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,933
give me a call
when he gets there,
will you?

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,267
I'll let him know.
Good.

But I'm paying for it.

Yeah. Willie,

It's all right.
Go, go.

199
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:38,033
I think you should
take a look at this.

200

I don't need to.
I know what it says.

I'll be gone by dark.

202
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,634
I'm not asking you to leave,
Jack. I'm asking you
to have a conversation.

203
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,966
Tramell says
this subpoena's been chasing
you for over a year now.

204
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:00,200
It's gonna catch up
with you sometime.
I'm not going back.

205
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,333
I'm not saying you should.

206
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,533
But a year's a long time
to spend looking
over your shoulder.

207
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,000
A lifetime of that's
gonna drive you
out of your mind.

208
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,233
Whatever I've done
I've paid for in full.

209
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,833
All I've got left
is my freedom. I'm not lettin'
them take that away from me.

210

Freedom. What kind
of freedom's this, Jack?
You're runnin' away.

What do you want
from me, Carl?
What do you want?

I'm sorry.

I can't remember
the many times

But I do know
that I owe you.

You've lost a lot, Jack.

217

I know that.
I know that.

218
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:50,100
When you called me up
for the first time in--
What? Ten years?

219
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,166
I hoped you were maybe
looking for more than
just a place to stay.

220

I'm trying to
find a way to make
some sense of it all.

221
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,966
It's a normal impulse,
especially for people
like us.

222
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:04,100
Yeah, except you found
what you were looking for.

223
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,667

I just meant
it's different for me.

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,166
You never asked me
why I quit.

230
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:36,033
I figured
you would have told me
if you wanted me to know.

231
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,500
While I was in Beirut--

232
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:57,799
a counterinsurgency
operation.

233
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:03,267
I was holding a suspect.

234
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,333
The attack window was open.
Our time was limited.

235
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:12,133
I was sure I had the right guy,
but he wasn't giving me
the information I needed,

236
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,166
so I kept pushing.

237
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,899
Pushed him hard...

238
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,400
until he finally told me
what I wanted to hear...

239
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,400
right before he died.

240
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,766
He wasn't the right guy, Jack.

241
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,467
The intel was bad.

- I lost 14 men
and 21 civilians that day.
- Carl, that's the job.

We don't--

244

by counting how many lives
we've saved,

245

but by how many we've lost.

246
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,433
You know, I'm not so sure
I have found what
I was lookin' for.

247
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,300
But I have found a way
to live with myself.

248
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,467
It took a long time.

249
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,799
The first thing I had to do
was stop running.

not the only place
with money.

you're trying to do, Carl,

Rumors? They are not rumors.

been crossing the border
and stealing our children.

Mr. Prime Minister,
this news has caught us

But our priority here
in Washington is to ensure the
safety of you and your family.

My priority
is to defend my country
from this monster Juma,

411
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,533
and the only way
that can happen
is if you accelerate...

your congress has already
pledged to us.

428
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,166
Mr. President.
Senator Taylor.

429
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,033
Tom told me
what's happening
in Sangala.

430
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,766
It is a damn tough
situation.
I don't understand.

431
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:07,133
How could Juma raise an army
without our getting wind of it?

432
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,166
We disarmed him
three years ago.

433
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:13,899
The U.N.'s been
monitoring the situation.
Not closely enough apparently.

434
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:17,200
Then you have no idea
who's supplying him?

435
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:21,100
All we know is Juma's
secured some fairly advanced
weapons systems,

436
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,833
which is why
Prime Minister Matobo...

437
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:27,033
is asking for
our military assistance.

438
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,734
And what did you tell him?
The truth.
It's not a viable option.

439
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,667
You don't agree.

440
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,200
We have troops in the region.

441
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,799
A show of force
might make Juma blink.

442
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:45,133
And if it doesn't,
we get caught up in
another civil quagmire...

443
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,267
halfway around the world.

444
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,300
Now, that is
a hard sell.

445
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,100
Especially when there's nothing
in Sangala worth protecting.

446
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:56,300
No natural resources,
no substantial economic ties,

447
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,700
nothing that threatens
our national security.

448
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:02,133
The last time Juma
made a power grab,

449
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,133
he ignited a tribal war
that killed tens of thousands
of civilians.

450
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,866
Our involvement
could avert a genocide.

451
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:13,600
And this war
will be tragic too.

452
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,533
But it isn't our war.

453
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,367
Which is why I've ordered the
ambassador to begin evacuating
all nonmilitary nationals.

454
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,066
I think that's a mistake.

455
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,133
I don't want any Americans
caught in the cross fire
when Juma starts shooting.

456
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,433
Closing our embassy

01:33:07,734 --> 01:33:10,267
I, Allison Taylor,
do solemnly swear--

1217
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:13,066
I, Allison Taylor,
do solemnly swear--

1218
01:33:13,133 --> 01:33:16,899
That I will faithfully execute
the office of the president
of the United States--

1219
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,899
That I will
faithfully execute...

1220
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:21,333
the office of the president
of the United States--

1221
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:24,866
[ Man ] And will,
to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend...

1222
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,866
the constitution
of the United States--

1223
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:31,066
And will,
to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend...

1224
01:33:31,133 --> 01:33:33,899
the constitution
of the United States--

1225
01:33:33,966 --> 01:33:36,433
So help me God.
So help me God.

1226
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,267
Congratulations,
Madam President.
Thank you.

1227
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:40,300
Thank you, Chief Justice.

1228
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:52,500
Keep going.
Keep going.

1229
01:33:57,333 --> 01:33:59,734
When the founders
of our country...

1230
01:33:59,799 --> 01:34:04,133
boldly declared America's
independence to the world,

1231
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,866
they knew that they derived
their power to govern...

1232
01:34:07,933 --> 01:34:10,667
from three basic
human rights--

1233
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:15,200
life, liberty
and the pursuit
of happiness.

1234
01:34:15,267 --> 01:34:17,467
Today...

1235
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:20,367
we rededicate ourselves...

1236
01:34:20,433 --> 01:34:25,033
to the preservation
of those inalienable rights.

1237
01:34:26,033 --> 01:34:27,966
But even as
we carry forth...

1238
01:34:28,033 --> 01:34:31,300
the torch lit
by those great men,

1239
01:34:31,367 --> 01:34:33,833
we need to remember...

1240
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:38,333
its light doesn't always shine
as brightly as it should.

1241
01:34:39,567 --> 01:34:43,233
It flickers and grows dim...

1242
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,567
because of apathy,
greed...

1243
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,333
and fear.

1244
01:34:52,433 --> 01:34:54,966
De Tocqueville said,

1245
01:34:55,033 --> 01:34:57,467
"In every democracy...

1246
01:34:57,533 --> 01:35:00,833
the people get
the government they deserve."

1247
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,300
Today...

1248
01:35:04,367 --> 01:35:07,166
I am asking
each of you...

1249
01:35:07,233 --> 01:35:09,166
to help me
give you...

1250
01:35:09,233 --> 01:35:13,033
the government
you deserve.

1251
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,833
We all share
the responsibility...

1252
01:35:16,899 --> 01:35:19,799
history has placed
in our hands.

1253
01:35:21,233 --> 01:35:23,533
The future--

1254
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,066
Our future...

1255
01:35:27,133 --> 01:35:29,133
depends on it.

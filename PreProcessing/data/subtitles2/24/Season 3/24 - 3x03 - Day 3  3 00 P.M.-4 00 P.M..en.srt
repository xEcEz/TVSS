00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,471
Previously on 24

2
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,345
What if I can get us a copy
of keeler's playbook?

3
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,479
What exactly do you mean
by "playbook"?

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,612
His entire prep for tonight's debate.

5
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,936
- Damn it, I told you to drop that.
- Will you just listen to me?

6
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:23,242
There is something you need to see.

7
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,726
There's nothing i need to see.

8
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:27,645
It's about anne. It's something that
we didn't know about her.

9
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:30,257
Something that could damage all of us.

10
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:32,788
- Can I talk to you now?
- Yeah, Of course.

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,078
Kim, what's up?

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,073
Chase and I have been
going out for a while,

13
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,264
and it's starting to get serious.

14
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,154
I really care for him, dad.

15
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:44,105
- So what do you think?
- I don't know what I think.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,852
We want the release
of ramon salazar.

17
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:49,699
If you refuse to comply,

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,545
the virus will be released.

19
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:54,594
It looks like the virus was delivered
in a crystalline form.

20
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,963
Maybe what you're looking for
is a white powder.

21
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:59,331
It would look like a bag
of cocaine or heroin?

22
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,503
Yeah, that may even be the strategy.
Someone thinks they're selling a bag of coke.

23
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,690
when, in fact,
they're handling the virus.

24
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:07,683
- Where did you get that money
- It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,002
Okay, we needed it.

26
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,183
I got it.

27
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:11,875
So this is how you're
going to help you're family?

28
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:13,300
By dealing drugs?

29
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,593
I'm not dealing them.
It's a stupid delivery.

30
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:17,937
That kid's walking around with a bag
of cocaine that's got the virus in it.

31
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,104
He doesn't know it.

32
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,026
I need to find him and stop him
from putting it into circulation.

33
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:24,188
You didn't shoot up, did you?

34
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,837
Why? You think you can hide it?

35
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,484
I'm not trying to hide it from you.

36
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,516
I'm trying to quit. / Okay.
People don't just quit, jack.

37
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:30,608
I am not.

38
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,966
going on record with this addiction.
Do you understand me?

39
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,659
You're the only person who knows
about it, so it's going to stay that way.

40
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,914
Give me an update.

41
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:38,271
Kyle's still in his house.

42
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,627
What about the package?

43
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:41,004
It's with him.

44
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:43,721
- And ramon?
- Just waiting to come home.

45
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,280
Good.

46
00:01:55,871 --> 00:02:01,692
The following takes place
between 3:00 p.m and 4:00 p.m.

47
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,316
Adam, have you downloaded
everyone's folders for the meeting?

48
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:11,002
Not yet. I'm still pulling up some of the
medical details about the virus.

49
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,245
Don't waste a lot of time on that.

50
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:15,357
The only thing our people need to know
is that it kills within 24 hours of exposure

51
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,430
and we believe Kyle Singer
is transporting it.

52
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,872
I got all that.

53
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,597
What about our approach to Singer?
Jack's going to meet nicole duncan,

54
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:23,017
head of health services, los angeles.

55
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,089
They're going to take a haz-mat
team over to Singer's apartment.

56
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,481
He's waiting for her now.

61
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:43,949
Hi, Jack.

62
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,017
How you doing?

63
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,094
I'm okay, Nicole.
How have you been?

64
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,170
Until this afternoon,
I was doing fine.

65
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,561
You know, I, uh...

66
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,549
I tried to reach you
after I heard about Teri.

67
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,960
Yeah, I know.

68
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,363
After that, I kind of withdrew.

69
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:04,147
But I appreciated the calls. Thanks.

70
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,604
We should get going.

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,767
I just finished running Macer's
epidemiological model.

72
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:18,974
Her estimates were off.

73
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,586
Better or worse than we thought?

74
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:22,080
Twice as bad.

75
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:25,266
She had nine percent of the
population infected within a week,

76
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,237
but it's closer to 20%.

77
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:30,840
And the infection-to-mortality rate
is higher than her estimate.

78
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,876
Almost 95% lethal.

79
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:39,092
I've been hunting germs for 12 years
and I've never seen anything like this.

80
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:40,782
Great.

81
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:47,468
Are you feeling okay?

82
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,333
Yeah. Why?

83
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:51,570
You're perspiring.

84
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:56,249
I've been non-stop since noon.

85
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,851
Look, we're going to be
about eight minutes out.

86
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:04,252
It would be great if we could go over the
quarantine protocols before we get there.

87
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,087
- No problem.
- Good.

88
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:14,947
If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be released.

89
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:20,442
I want the release of Ramon Salazar...

90
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:21,773
Gael.

91
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:23,540
Here, take a look at this.

92
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,342
Closing in on the point
of origin of this call.

93
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,769
You see this code artifact here?

94
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,744
- Yeah.
- I found a few more on this recording.

95
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:35,328
I think it's coming from
a domestic switching node.

96
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,608
You think the call was made
from inside the U.S.?

97
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,669
Maybe. I'm piping it
over to your system.

98
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:43,136
See if you can find a match.

99
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,079
- Okay.
- But do it after the meeting.

100
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:46,547
What meeting?

101
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,445
Tony's shifting resources
to help Jack in the field.

102
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,658
He's closing in on the virus.

103
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,187
- Gael.
- Yeah?

104
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,654
Jack needs that audio feed in place
when he gets to Kyle Singer's apartment.

105
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,836
I know, but Tony needs me to
take care of something right now.

106
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,157
- I'll get it to you after the meeting.
- I need you to do it before the meeting.

107
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:05,421
Jack's on his way there.
So come do it now.

108
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,804
I can't! Stop bugging me.

109
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,387
I'll get it to you.

110
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:11,400
Fine.

111
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,416
Have you thought about how it will be
when Ramon comes back?

112
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,365
How it will be?

113
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:33,791
Like it was before.

114
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,995
Things have changed, Hector.

115
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,999
Nothing's changed.

116
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:40,040
He's only been gone three months.

117
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,862
You've changed.

118
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,797
You've been in charge
while he's been in prison.

119
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,199
Are you willing to give that up so easily?

120
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:58,856
What is it?

121
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,516
Bauer's telling CTU he's
about to intercept the package.

122
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:04,592
- How?
- I'm not sure. I'm about to find out.

123
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:07,333
- Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer?
- Of course.

124
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,687
Then we're fine.

125
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,657
Hey, how was the interview?

126
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,423
Fine.

127
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,796
What's up, dad?

128
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:42,241
Your mother told me you paid the rent.

129
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,667
All three months we owed.

130
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:48,165
Yeah. I came into a little money.

131
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:55,097
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't
have a job come into a little money?

132
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:00,956
Tim and I, we went down to
the track the other day.

133
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,979
He knows this guy
over at the stables, so, uh,

134
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,900
- we got a tip.
- Where did you get the money?

135
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,338
Dad, what does it matter?

136
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,407
Honestly, the rent's paid
for three months. All right?

137
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,472
The pressure's off us now.

138
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,536
Did you do something illegal?

139
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,868
No.

140
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,569
I told you we went to Santa Anita,

141
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:25,260
and we got lucky.
I didn't do anything illegal.

142
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:27,807
Don't lie to me.
I've got enough to worry about.

143
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,487
Now, this is my house.

144
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:33,669
I pay the rent!
I take care of you and your mother.

145
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,756
And when you get that job,

146
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,299
you go ahead and
pay me back, huh?

147
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,842
Wait a second.
We're not done here!

148
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:41,110
No, we're done here.

149
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:42,444
Don't walk away from me!

150
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,197
You should be thanking me
instead of crawling up my ass.

151
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:45,360
Kyle!

152
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,522
Kyle!

153
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,770
Open the door!

154
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,367
Open the door!

155
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:54,540
His name's Kyle Singer.

156
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,316
We think he's transporting the virus,

157
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,540
although it's likely he doesn't
realize what he's carrying.

158
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,433
How could he not know?

159
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:04,026
Health Services believes that the virus
was made to look like heroin or cocaine.

160
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:08,210
We know that Kyle Singer was hired to deliver
a package from Mexico to a dealer in LA.

161
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,155
He thinks he's smuggling drugs.

162
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,831
That's the working theory.

163
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,993
Now, here's the thing.
Once Singer delivers that bag of powder,

164
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,130
it gets cut up and distributed
throughout the city.

165
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,266
At that point, it becomes
impossible to contain.

166
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,718
Was LAPD grabbing Singer?

167
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,270
No.

168
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,620
Why not?
Can't they get there faster?

169
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,093
LAPD is not trained to handle haz-zone.

170
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:28,073
Jack Bauer's going to go in
with a team from Health Services.

171
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,078
We're going to run
the operation from here,

172
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,262
updating the president in real time.

173
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:33,353
Now,

174
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:36,092
we have to approach
Singer with care.

175
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,831
He has no idea how
deadly this powder is.

176
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,612
I'm not fighting.
I'm just asking the questions.

177
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,307
- He should respect us.
- Of course he does...

178
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,831
now will you please calm down?

179
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,950
$1,800 is...

180
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:05,349
He said he won the money at the track?

181
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,730
He could come up with
a better lie than that.

182
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,187
Well, maybe he's telling the truth.

183
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,966
Oh, come on, Helen.

184
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:12,582
- Where you going?
- Wherever.

185
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,036
What's in the bag?

186
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,306
- Some clothes.
- Well, open it.

187
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,595
What?

188
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,423
Open the bag.

189
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,463
I'm warning you: Open that bag

190
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:29,799
or I'm going to open it myself.

191
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,402
Mom?

192
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:34,015
- Kyle, listen to your father.
- It's none of his business.

193
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,864
As long as you're living
in my house, it is!

194
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,261
Your house?

195
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,290
This isn't your house.
You can't even pay the rent.

196
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,437
Oh, Kyle...

197
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,822
Come on, will you
quit snooping, please?

198
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,678
Don't even think about it.

199
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,972
What is this? Huh?

200
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,727
Coke? Heroin?

201
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,179
- Give it back, dad.
- What did you say?

202
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,112
- I need it.
- What do you mean, you "need" it?

203
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,799
What are you, some kind of junkie?

204
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,065
No.

205
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm just delivering it to this guy, okay?
And if I don't get it to him...

206
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,403
Who?

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,325
- It's just a guy, okay?
- Who?!

208
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:26,311
Give me a name.

209
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:30,974
Kyle, answer your father.

210
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,349
You just give it to me, okay?!

211
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,644
Stop it!
Hey, stop it, both of you!

212
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:42,607
Both of you!
Both of you!

213
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:45,141
Stop! Sam!
Sam, don't, Sam!

214
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:48,107
Kyle!

215
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,146
I can't reiterate this enough.

216
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:07,106
This is a credible threat.

217
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:11,267
Salazar's people will release this
virus if we don't find it first.

218
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,786
So lets get going.

219
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:25,567
Okay, we're going to need a white room
with full audio and video capability.

220
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,914
Get me 3b if that's available.

221
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:31,012
Log him in.
I'll be there in a minute.

222
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:32,668
I thought you were supposed
to be with my dad.

223
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,976
I was. He sent me back here.

224
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,277
Why?

225
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:37,866
To question Parker.

226
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,596
Parker? He already turned in Kyle Singer.
What else are you going to get from him?

227
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:41,819
Nothing.

228
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,930
And that's the point.

229
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,847
- I don't understand.
- Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.

230
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,483
He's making me sit out.

231
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,631
Why?

232
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,406
Why do you think?

233
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:54,569
Because of us?

234
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:59,280
- Chase, I'm sorry...
- He says he's protecting me...

235
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,500
but I'm not the one
he's trying to protect here.

236
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:03,998
You're not blaming me, are you?

237
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,092
Look, all I'm saying is,
we shouldn't have told him.

238
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:08,745
What were we supposed to do?

239
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,931
Keep sneaking around
until someone catches us?

240
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,031
We could have waited.

241
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,202
Until when?

242
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:16,227
He'd have the Same response
no matter when we told him.

243
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,868
I got to deal with this kid Parker.

244
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:38,127
Jeffery.

245
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,575
The food's exceptionally bad today.

246
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:45,235
Aren't there laws in this country

247
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:48,122
for cruel and unusual punishment?

248
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:53,636
Tell Annicon, I'm ready to talk.

249
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:06,803
Bauer couldn't tell me,
but Salazar's got some kind of leverage.

250
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,403
Enough to get him released.

251
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:11,849
I'm not about to let this son of a bitch
erase the last two years of my life.

252
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:15,055
Call your friend at the state department,
see what he can tell you.

253
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,520
Annicon.

254
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,537
- Mr. Annicon?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,984
This is Jeff Benson,
Salazar's guard.

256
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,148
I know who you are.

257
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,240
Sir, Salazar asked to see you.

258
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,492
Why?

259
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,002
He says he's ready to talk.

260
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,387
I'll be right there.

261
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,636
University of Southern California

262
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:51,586
Don't ask me why, just do it.

263
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,688
I hope you can get a refund.

264
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:55,948
A refund?

265
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,227
From whoever sold you
that load of crap.

266
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:59,718
David,

267
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,744
Keeler is going to use
this against you in this debate.

268
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,361
Now, ignoring it's
not going to make it go away.

269
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,983
Neither will dignifying it with a response.

270
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:09,960
He's going to claim that Anne perjured
herself, which, in case you've forgotten,

271
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:13,533
- is a felony.
- Anne is no felon.

272
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,238
The allegation itself
is enough to damage you.

273
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,624
Now, come on, David please, think.

274
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,601
You know you can't go into this debate
without some kind of response.

275
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,486
What do you propose?

276
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:27,122
Talk to Anne,

277
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,445
make sure she's told you everything.

278
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:31,675
She has told me everything.

279
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:34,152
Are you sure?

280
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,869
Ever since I started seeing Anne,

281
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,066
you've taken every chance to
undermine our relationship.

282
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:42,732
- Just because you don't like her...
- You're absolutely right, I don't like her.

283
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:46,293
This isn't about me and Anne.
It's about you and Anne.

284
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,446
Now, if she's got nothing to hide,
fine, David, she's got nothing to hide.

285
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:55,228
But you'd better find out before you
face off with Keeler on national television.

286
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:21,651
Did you ask your friend
Jack Bauer what's going on?

287
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,240
You did, didn't you?

288
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:29,497
But he wouldn't say.

289
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,439
Must be very frustrating,
Luis, being kept in the dark.

290
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,958
You have something to tell me?

291
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,771
- I asked you here, didn't I?
- Then start talking,

292
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:43,106
because you used up
my patience an hour ago.

293
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:46,141
you are dog with a bone, Luis.

294
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:48,817
Once you bite down, you don't let go.

295
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,282
When I'm out of here,

296
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:52,373
I don't want you on me anymore.

297
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:54,592
When you're out of here?

298
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:56,519
You were right.

299
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,165
In a few hours, I'm going home.

300
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,505
Really?

301
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,267
And how will you manage that?

302
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,810
Hector's a good brother.

303
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,234
Unless he's got a key to this place,

304
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,548
- you're not going anywhere.
- But he does have a key.

305
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,358
And when he turns it,

306
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,894
the last two years of your life,

307
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,361
all the hours you've spent
away from your family,

308
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:17,675
all the work you've done
to put me in here

309
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,853
will go away...

310
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:22,031
...just like that.

311
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:28,620
I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis.

312
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:32,502
I wanted it to be the
last thing you ever heard.

313
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:09,270
Your son will be
returned to you now.

314
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:17,047
I'm just saying that Kyle
is in over his head.

315
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,042
We're not calling a lawyer.

316
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,875
- He hasn't even been arrested.
- Not yet.

317
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,245
Maybe he won't be.

318
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:27,177
If we leave it alone,
don't do anything,

319
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,865
maybe this whole thing
will just go away.

320
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,553
- You can't be serious.
- Why not, Sam?

321
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:34,373
Why do we have to let anybody know?

322
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:38,462
- Because it's against the law not to.
- What are you suggesting we do,

323
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,107
call the police?

324
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:43,545
Maybe they'll give us a reward
and then we can pay our rent.

325
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,394
All right, that wasn't fair.

326
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,865
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,518
Oh, my god!

328
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,765
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm going to get rid of it!

329
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,011
- You want to visit your son in jail?!
- Wait a minute.

330
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,755
Helen!

331
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:10,833
- Get back! Get back!
- Who are you people?

332
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,481
Where's Kyle Singer?!

333
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,678
- Kyle Singer!
- He's not here.

334
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,586
Isolate him and draw blood for
a full panel. Get an oral swab.

335
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,703
Seal off all these windows and vents.

336
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,305
No!

337
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,661
in here! In here!

338
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,975
- No!
- Put her in quarantine.

339
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,487
Tony, the virus is out.

340
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:36,165
I repeat, the virus is out.

341
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,842
Copy that, Jack.
Where is it?

342
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,407
In the sewage system.

343
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,960
Get DWP to shut down
the lines from ground zero.

344
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:43,270
It might also be airborne.

345
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,924
Get the fire department and
LAPD to set up a perimeter.

346
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,773
Tell them we've got
a level-three hot zone.

347
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,583
Copy that.

348
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,162
Come in.

349
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,827
Wayne said you wanted to see me.

350
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:10,961
What's wrong?

351
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,015
Keeler.

352
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,335
He's bringing your
ex-husband into this debate.

353
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:19,133
The SEC's investigation into his company.

354
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,144
Well, Ted was convicted,
and served his sentence.

355
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,485
You know that.

356
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,501
I know what you told me.

357
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:27,259
I told you everything there is to know.

358
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,605
Ted's company was introducing
a hypertension drug...

359
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,738
- and you reviewed the research.
- Yes.

360
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,419
Which later turned out
to have been fabricated.

361
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,179
Which Ted knew at the time,

362
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,252
and I didn't.

363
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,409
Now Ted's claiming that you both knew.

364
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,214
He can't reverse himself 8 years
after giving sworn testimony.

365
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,983
Well, he is.

366
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,977
And he's willing to go
on record with the press.

367
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:56,970
I don't know what to say,
except he's a liar.

368
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:59,121
It's your word against his.

369
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:01,242
David...

370
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,997
you have reason to be suspicious.

371
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,576
God knows,

372
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:10,027
you've been betrayed by some of
the people you've trusted most,

373
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:12,481
but I'm not sherry.

374
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,846
I told you the whole truth once.

375
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:20,393
I'm not going to defend it.

376
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:26,350
Because if there's anything less
than complete trust between us...

377
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:31,269
I do trust you, Anne.

378
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,606
You should.

379
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:43,827
Yes.

380
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:46,673
We need to talk, David.
I'm with Anne now.

381
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,821
Ah, let me guess…
She denied everything.

382
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,252
I believe her.

383
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:54,792
Yeah, well, listen, I might be able to make
this whole thing go away.

384
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:55,863
How?

385
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,729
Meet you in the auditorium...

386
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,502
alone.

387
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,275
All right.

388
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:08,121
So have you had a chance to take
a look at Nicole's field report yet?

389
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:09,603
Yeah. I'm almost done.

390
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:10,938
What are your impressions?

391
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:13,196
Based on what I've read
so far, I'm optimistic.

392
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,453
So you think we'll be able
to contain the virus?

393
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,697
At the very least, we should be
able to limit the casualties.

394
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:19,194
Even though the virus was airborne?

395
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:22,167
Well, there is some risk of it spreading,
but Nicole's team acted fast.

396
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:26,092
They evacuated and sealed off the apartment
building and quarantined the Singers.

397
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:29,825
- When do we get the test results?
- Five minutes, ten tops.

398
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,806
So looks like we lucked out, huh?

399
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:33,975
- Yeah, we deserve a little luck.
- All right, look,

400
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,810
I got to go. Make sure you keep me
in the loop, all right?

401
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,301
- Okay, you do the Same.
- Okay.

402
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:42,673
Tony, LAPD's setting up the perimeter, but they
need wind vectors for the last 15 minutes.

403
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,186
Call meteorology.

404
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:45,698
Extension 212.

405
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:47,831
Tony, local news picked up
the story about the dead body

406
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,826
being dumped at Health Services.

407
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,875
Great.

408
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:53,302
They want a statement.
What do you want me to tell them?

409
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:54,874
Nothing.

410
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,466
Tony, warden Mitchell is on the phone.

411
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:00,017
He's calling from the prison.
He says it's urgent.

412
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:06,763
Almeida.

413
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,074
Mr. and Mrs. Singer?

414
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:20,865
What the hell is going on here?

415
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,654
Because this is not about drugs.

416
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,994
We think you've been
exposed to a virus.

417
00:23:24,995 --> 00:23:27,332
- A virus?
- It's called Cordillera Virus.

418
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,266
We believe that your son carried it in from
Mexico this morning without knowing.

419
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,050
What do you mean "carried it in"? How?

420
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:34,038
He thought he was carrying drugs.

421
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,390
So, we've been exposed?

422
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm afraid so.

423
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,431
Wh-what does that mean?
Are we sick?

424
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:44,097
We're going to have to keep you quarantined
until we get the results back from your tests.

425
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,658
Excuse me for one moment.

426
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,985
- Yeah, this is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

427
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,280
Tony, I think Kyle Singer's
been exposed.

428
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,797
Yeah, we've already got
an all points out on him.

429
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,143
Have you set a perimeter?

430
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,767
Yeah. We're doing everything
we can to contain this thing.

431
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,560
All agencies and departments are
in the loop on a need-to-know basis.

432
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,853
- Okay, good work.
- Listen, Jack,

433
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:02,172
I know this isn't a best time to tell you, but

434
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,279
I just got some bad news.
I figured you'd want to know about it.

435
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,588
What's wrong?

436
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:07,575
Luis Annicon was murdered.

437
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,708
- Murdered, how?
- Salazar's guard.

438
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:10,633
We've got him in custody.
He claims that ...

439
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:14,902
Salazar had a son kidnapped
and threatened to kill him if he didn't do it.

440
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:17,299
Jack, I'm sorry. I know you
two worked closely on this case.

441
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,809
- Tony, I'm going to have to get back to you.
- Is everything okay?

442
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,561
- I'm going to get back to you.
- Jack?

443
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,121
- These results can't be right.
- They are.

444
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:44,736
- Check it again.
- I have.

445
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:48,441
Blood and saliva, atmospheric and
surface tests, they're all negative.

446
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:52,347
We can't find even a…
a trace amount of this virus.

447
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,435
What the hell are you doing?
You haven't showered down yet.

448
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:08,978
We're not at risk.
What are you talking about?

449
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,100
- I watched the powder get out.
- It's harmless, Jack.

450
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:13,383
Some form of silicate, but that's all.

451
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,664
- What?
- There is no virus in the powder.

452
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:19,009
We tested five Samples.
There weren't even trace amounts.

453
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,560
Atmospheric and surface
analysis also came up negative,

454
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,607
and Kyle's parents
tested negative, as well.

455
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,528
You're sure about this?

456
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,994
The only thing I'm not sure about
is if we're on the right trail.

457
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:32,102
No. No, the body that was dropped off
at Health Services was linked to Kyle Singer.

458
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:35,274
Why would Salazar's people pay him
to bring across a bag of worthless powder?

459
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:38,085
Fine, Jack, but where do we
even start looking?

460
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:41,253
I don't know.

461
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:47,944
Wait a second.

462
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:51,092
Macer said the only way to transport
the virus was in crystalline form, right?

463
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,173
Yeah, that's the only way it can
survive outside a living body.

464
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,211
What if it was never
outside a living body?

465
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,006
What do you mean?

466
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:59,296
What if the virus
was transported in a living host?

467
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:02,693
What if Kyle Singer was infected earlier
this morning in Mexico before he even left?

468
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,444
But Salazar has no leverage if Singer
was walking around, infecting people.

469
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:08,413
That's the point.
He wouldn't be contagious yet.

470
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,666
The incubation period is 14 hours.

471
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,361
Right. Think about it.

472
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,767
We know for a fact that Kyle Singer
was in Mexico 11 hours ago.

473
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:18,145
Hector Salazar hasn't threatened to
release the virus for another three hours.

474
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,199
The math adds up.

475
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,546
We need to find Kyle Singer.

476
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,287
- Hello?
- Linda.

477
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:26,519
Kyle, I told you, I have
nothing to say to you.

478
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,327
No, listen to me, okay?

479
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:30,853
I'm in trouble.
Yeah, because you're dealing drugs.

480
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,535
I need your help.

481
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:34,217
What happened?

482
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,379
My dad found the stuff.

483
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,045
We got in a fight,

484
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:40,320
I split, but he's still got it, okay?

485
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,594
And I got to get this them, all right?

486
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:44,664
These guys are hard core.
I got to make it right.

487
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,585
Make it right? How?

488
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,272
I know, I was thinking,
you know, maybe,

489
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,820
maybe I could pay them enough,
you know, just

490
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:52,246
- to keep them off my back. - You want me to give you money?

491
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,706
No, no, no, just borrow.

492
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,532
How much?

493
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:57,932
It's about 20 grand on the street.

494
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,998
I don't have that kind of money, Kyle.

495
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:02,440
Didn't you say your dad keeps
some cash around the house?

496
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,314
- Not that much.
- Linda, listen to me!

497
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,575
These guys...

498
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:11,169
they will kill me if I don't
give them something.

499
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,870
Please... please, anything
will help right now.

500
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:17,072
Now you want me to
get involved in this?

501
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,384
Just... please let me borrow
something, anything.

502
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:23,087
I'll pay you back,
I swear to god.

503
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:26,652
- Where are you?
- I'm at the mall.

504
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,573
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Thank you.

505
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,527
CTU knows the powder is not real.
Now they're going after Singer.

506
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,829
What do you want me to do?

507
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,879
Stay with him,
and as soon as he's alone,

508
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,678
- Grab him and take him into containment.
- Done.

509
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,783
You can't let the cops get him.

510
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,887
We need Singer to make this work.

511
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:02,605
Of course there's no way
we'll ever release Salazar.

512
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:07,431
CTU is very close to
containing the threat.

513
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,652
Yes, that's right.

514
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,036
All right, Stan.

515
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,859
I'll make sure you're kept in the loop.

516
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,014
What have we got, Wayne?

517
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:17,069
I just talked to Anne's ex-husband.

518
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,280
Now, listen, all Ted Packard
wants is money.

519
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,130
If we pay him off, he'll
recant before this debate.

520
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:24,647
That's blackmail.

521
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:27,168
- That's business.
- I don't think so.

522
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,489
David, it's a hell of a lot cheaper
than trying to defend against this allegation,

523
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,538
which is going to hurt you.

524
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,585
I've faced down worse lies.

525
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,969
I think I've earned some credibility.

526
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,080
You read the polls this morning?

527
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,353
Because Keeler is closing the gap,

528
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,855
and this race is much
closer than it should be.

529
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,528
And listen, I know
it's distasteful there, but

530
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,985
in cost-benefit terms,
it's a no brainer.

531
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,208
Anne won't think so.

532
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:57,754
- Anne doesn't have to know.
- I can't keep it from her.

533
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,888
Well, that's your choice.

534
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:02,723
But if this comes out,

535
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:07,091
Anne is going to find herself on the front
page of every single newspaper in this country,

536
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:10,418
and David, she's not Sherry. She's not
equipped to handle that kind of scrutiny,

537
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:13,837
and you will not be able
to protect her from it.

538
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,877
Now, between this debate

539
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:23,759
and the threat of this outbreak, you have
enough on your plate to worry about.

540
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,083
Don't be a martyr.

541
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,407
Keep it simple.

542
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:34,292
We could have the money
within the hour.

543
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,533
Do it.

544
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:02,546
What's going on?

545
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:04,794
They don't have their suits on.
What does that mean? Are we okay?

546
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,504
Yes. The powder was harmless.

547
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,108
Oh, thank god... then you put us
through all this for nothing.

548
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,724
- You scared the hell out of us.
- Mr. Singer, we still need to find your son.

549
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,692
Is there anything that you
can tell us that would help?

550
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,514
Why? You just said
the powder was harmless.

551
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,390
We believe that your son was infected
with the virus in Mexico earlier this morning

552
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:20,941
before he came home.

553
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:24,266
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

554
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,543
What are you saying,

555
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:28,275
that our son could die?

556
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:31,798
- Yes, that could happen.
- Oh, god.

557
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,201
I know how difficult this must be for you,
and I'm sorry.

558
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:38,342
But we need to find your son,
we need to find him now.

559
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:43,256
- Have you tried his cell phone?
- Yes. The line's been disconnected.

560
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,631
No, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

561
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,149
Wait.

562
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,039
- He took my phone this morning.
- What's the number?

563
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,259
818-555-0103.

564
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,366
Okay.

565
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,543
I'm going to need
one of you to call him.

566
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,646
This is my fault.

567
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:05,612
I never would have done any of this
if I couldn't take care of my own family.

568
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,823
- No.
- Yes. You know, it's true.

569
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,990
Tony, it's Jack.

570
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:12,279
Yeah, Jack, I just spoke to LAPD.
They've got a priority APB on Singer.

571
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,565
Okay, good.
I think we've got a number on him.

572
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:15,559
All right, look,

573
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,298
we'll thread the line
through a tracing matrix.

574
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:22,437
Okay. The number is 818-555-0103.

575
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:23,955
I want you to route the call
back to my cell phone.

576
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:24,955
You got it.

577
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:28,452
I want you to trace that number and
reroute the call to Jack's cell phone.

578
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,601
I'm going to need one of
you to make the call now,

579
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:35,683
I need you to keep him on the line
as long as possible so we can trace him.

580
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:41,813
What am I supposed to tell him?

581
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,343
The truth.

582
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:46,930
Tony, you set?

583
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:48,706
Yeah, we're ready.

584
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,110
- Linda.
- Kyle, it's your father.

585
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,865
Dad?

586
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,558
We need to talk.

587
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,205
Look, I don't know what
you want to talk about.

588
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:08,851
I already know how
pissed off you are, okay?

589
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:10,419
Look, um,

590
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,322
whatever you did...

591
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,833
I know you were just trying
to help out your mom and me.

592
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,215
Yeah, well, look, unless you're willing
to give back the stuff you took,

593
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,072
I got to deal with the situation, okay?

594
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:22,706
Kyle! Please, don't hang up.

595
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,573
Please! Listen.

596
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:26,439
Listen to me.

597
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,976
What I'm telling you is
important. Please,

598
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:30,246
you have to come home.

599
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,508
Dad, why do you sound different?

600
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:36,440
I need you to trust me onsomething I'm about to tell you.

601
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,812
Dad?

602
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:42,248
You may have gotten a virus,

603
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,122
something you picked
up in Mexico.

604
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,796
How'd you know I went to Mexico?

605
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,557
It doesn't matter.

606
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,317
But you may be sick.

607
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:55,108
And if you are, then you need
to get checked out by a doctor.

608
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,286
Dad, I don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

609
00:32:57,287 --> 00:33:00,451
- But I feel fine.
- I know it sounds crazy,

610
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,109
but it's real.

611
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,360
Now, there's e some people
here who are trying to help.

612
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:05,115
- Cops?
- No

613
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,556
Tony, have you got
a lock on this trace?

614
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:08,750
- We're going to lose this kid.
- How much longer?

615
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,556
I've got the cell tower, but it's
covering a three-mile radius.

616
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,371
I can't believe this.

617
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:15,760
This fight, one minute you
tell me that you love me,

618
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,149
the next minute, you're
selling me out to some cops.

619
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,267
They're not police, Kyle.

620
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:24,354
They're just trying to stop this virus
before it becomes an outbreak.

621
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,488
Dad, I already told youI feel fine, all right?

622
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:30,092
They're saying that you're not going to
start feeling sick for another few hours.

623
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,630
- But by then, it's going to be too late.
- Tony, have you got a lock yet?

624
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,876
How much longer?

625
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:34,589
10 seconds.

626
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,936
What do you want me to do?
You want me to turn myself in?

627
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:38,667
Because you may be sick.

628
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,784
And if you are, other people
are going to get infected.

629
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,923
- Tony...
- We got it, Jack.

630
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:46,330
He's at the Los Feliz Mall,
between Vermont and Sunset.

631
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:47,995
Okay, get his photograph
over to mall security.

632
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,622
Tell them not to approach him.

633
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:50,627
Look, Jack,

634
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,604
you're 20 minutes away by car,
I can land a team there in ten minutes.

635
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:54,840
Fine.

636
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,856
Tony, I don't want you taking Chase.

637
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:59,533
- Why not?
- I just don't.

638
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,038
Thank you very much.

639
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,978
We'll notify you as soon
as we have him in custody.

640
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:06,214
Please, help our son.

641
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:07,615
We will.

642
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,020
O'Brian.

643
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:15,969
Chloe, I'm not sure you've heard yet,
But Tony's heading off site for a while.

644
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,825
He is?

645
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:18,850
Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours.

646
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,875
- Okay.
- Let people in your area know.

647
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:23,011
- Okay, I will.
- Thanks.

648
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,684
What was that?

649
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:27,905
Michelle. She's taking over CTU
for a couple of hours.

650
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,261
Where's Tony?

651
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:30,544
They have a location on Singer.

652
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,505
Jack can't get there
in time, so Tony's going.

653
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:35,432
What? Tony's not field ops.

654
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:38,211
Seems like they're really going out of
their way to cut you out of the loop.

655
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,631
Did you do something
to piss off Jack?

656
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:45,216
Bad idea, Chase. You're just
going to make things worse.

657
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,889
Tony...

658
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,960
I just heard they found Kyle Singer.
Is this for real?

659
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,847
We'll see. I'm meeting Jack
over there right now.

660
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,976
Look, I'm done with this kid Parker.
He's said all he's gonna say.

661
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:02,866
- I want back on the case.
- Yeah, well,

662
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,540
we're handling it now,
Chase, all right?

663
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,162
Because Jack doesn't
want me there, right?

664
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:07,782
Did he tell you why he's cutting me out?

665
00:35:07,783 --> 00:35:11,050
I don't really care.
He's your boss, it's his call.

666
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,495
This isn't right.

667
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:18,560
Did he tell you this is because of Kim?

668
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:22,184
He found out we were seeing each other,
and this is how he's going to make me pay for it.

669
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,263
Take it up with Jack.

670
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,825
Just want to keep the line open for Tony.

671
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:27,454
Leave a message for Jack Bauer.

672
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:28,878
Damn it, Jack.

673
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,180
Chase.

674
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:40,430
Chase.

675
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:44,306
Look, I know my dad can be hard,
but he will come around.

676
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:46,285
How do you know?

677
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:47,390
Because I know my father.

678
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:50,192
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

679
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:52,363
What is that supposed to mean?

680
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,232
Nothing.

681
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,761
It's okay. Forget it, Kim.

682
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,529
Don't you think I feel
bad enough already?

683
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,517
Because I do.

684
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:05,564
We shouldn't have told him.

685
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:09,058
Well, the only other option I can think of
is for us to stop seeing each other,

686
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,141
which as far as I'm concerned,
is not an option.

687
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,346
Or is it?

688
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:21,133
- Chase, what do you want?
- I want to be able to do my job.

689
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:24,498
Kim, we need you at your station.
Tony's about to land.

690
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:52,362
Tony Almeida, CTU.

691
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,162
I think we found
the guy you're looking for.

692
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:55,713
He's in the rotunda.

693
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,456
- Bronson, lock down the east exit.
- Yes, sir.

694
00:37:57,457 --> 00:37:59,782
Pierson, I want you to run point
from the security office.

695
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:00,598
Alright.

696
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:26,027
How long have you been using, Jack?

697
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:27,303
What?

698
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:31,328
I did a rotation in rehab. You learn to
pick out when someone's using.

699
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:35,616
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

700
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,766
How long?

701
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,479
For a while now.

702
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:54,938
It was the only way I could maintain
my cover with the Salazars.

703
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,812
- Are you high now?
- No.

704
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:03,049
- It's empty, Jack.
- Nicole, I told you I'm fine.

705
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,470
- I'm not so sure.
- If you're not so sure, then turn me in.

706
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,842
I don't want to turn you in, Jack.

707
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:10,317
I'm worried about you.

708
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:15,115
You don't have to be.
I've kicked it.

709
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,911
I have a responsibility to stop this virus,

710
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:25,287
and I am taking a calculated risk that
you are more of an asset than a liability.

711
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:29,552
Just please don't screw this up.

712
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,957
I won't.

713
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,927
- Yeah?
- Hey, Jack,

714
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,107
Security found Singer.
I'm about to pick him up.

715
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:45,388
Okay, where are you?

716
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,868
Second floor rotunda,
top of the north escalator.

717
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:48,420
Where are you?

718
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,999
We're coming into
the loading dock, north entrance.

719
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,903
- Have you got a visual?
- Yeah, I got him.

720
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:55,652
- Where have you placed your men?
- We posted at all the main entrances.

721
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,762
Okay, good.
We should be there in a minute.

722
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,073
All right.

723
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,695
Have your men cover
all the parking level exits.

724
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:10,357
Let's go!

725
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,447
I don't want to cause any kind of commotion.

726
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,256
- Yeah?
- CTU's here.

727
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:26,472
They're about
to move in on the kid.

728
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:28,042
Just stand down.
It's too hot.

729
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,252
This is my only chance.
We can't let the kid get caught.

730
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:32,961
- No, no, wait.
- I can't wait. Gomez!

731
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:35,669
Wait here, I want to make a clean grab.

732
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,144
Yes, sir.

733
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,789
Kyle.

734
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,940
Who are you?

735
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,529
My name's Tony Almeida.

736
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,090
I'm a federal agent, but
I'm here to help you.

737
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:07,381
What your father told you
about your being sick is true.

738
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,393
I don't believe you.

739
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,592
You come with me,
I'll prove it to you.

740
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:51,904
Get out of the way! Move!

741
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,870
Nicole, he's been hit in the neck!

742
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:08,314
Jamie, give me your walkie-talkie.

743
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,687
We have an officer down.

744
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:13,000
Kyle Singer is not in custody.
I repeat, Kyle Singer is not in custody.

745
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:15,294
Maintain cover on all exits.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

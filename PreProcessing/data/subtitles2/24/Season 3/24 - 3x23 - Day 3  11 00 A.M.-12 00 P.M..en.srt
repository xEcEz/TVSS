1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,299
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,400
Mr. President, with respect to the
death of Alan Milliken, I know you lied.

3
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:20,500
You told the police Sherry was with you at
the time of Milliken's death.

4
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,800
Her fingerprints on this prescription
bottle prove otherwise.

5
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,500
What do you want?

6
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,199
Your resignation.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,099
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
Now, I can call Foxton, and he
can make this all disappear.

9
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,499
You mean steal evidence.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,600
Jack, I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders
out of the building without authorization.

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,699
Saunders has Michelle.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,500
He wants to trade her for his daughter.

13
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,199
Tony, put that gun on the dash

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
You help me make this trade, I will turn myself in.

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:48,199
Go to prison, whatever is gotta happen.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,100
We don't have a visual on Saunders.
I repeat we don't have a visual on Saunders

17
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:56,000
Keep your teams down. Stay down

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,899
I can't

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,800
Jane, it's ok, come here

20
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,800
Team A and B move

21
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,800
Move now

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,999
Stephen

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,199
I am pinned down

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,300
Saunders has a helicopter

25
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,400
Call in air support now

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.

27
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:27,399
Where are they?

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,900
It's not going to be that simple, Jack

29
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:31,799
This is Jack Bauer

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,399
Saunders is in custody.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,400
The following takes place
between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
We just got verification from Saunders' computer.

33
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,799
There's 11 vials across the country

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
How long till you can give us their location?

35
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,099
I am not sure I can.

36
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,499
Saunders applied a sophisticated decryption overlay.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,600
An unauthorized access will auto
erase the file structure.

38
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,100
- I will keep trying
- Ok

39
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,599
Where are the 11 vials?

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,300
You are wasting your time, and I am not foolish
enough to have that information in there.

41
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,999
Where are the vials?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,100
In the hands of dedicated men, true believers.

43
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,399
Believers in what?

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,999
That's the greatest threat to world
peace comes from this country.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There's a hotel not far from here where 800
innocent people are dead or dying because of you.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,099
Were they a threat to your world peace?

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,200
The United States must be forced
to retreat within its own borders.

48
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:52,200
Those people are simply the first casualties of war.

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,300
What happened to you, Stephen?

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
I was abandoned by the people I worked for

51
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,799
As you will be some day

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,500
But my message will be heard in less than 1 hour

53
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:10,799
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,100
My couriers have been instructed
to release the virus at noon.

55
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,500
They are in fail safe mode and they can't be recalled.

56
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:19,399
Tell us where they are, we will stop them.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,000
That is possible, but only if you agree to my terms.

58
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,799
What are your terms?

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,099
I have a private jet waiting at Van Nuys airport.

60
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,100
I need to be on it with presidential
guarantee of safe passage to North Africa.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,399
Never going to happen.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Then hundreds of thousands will die.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,199
I know what you are thinking, Jack

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,100
But the Bosnian secret police worked on me
for 2 years and couldn't break me

65
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,600
Do you really think you will be able
to do it in less than an hour?

66
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:55,150
Get me on that plane, Jack

67
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,700
You don't have a choice.

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,699
Bring me Jane Saunders.

69
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,700
I'm gonna need your gun, Tony.

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Frisk him

71
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:21,299
Hey

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,450
- You don't have to do that
- I have got my orders.

73
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,600
- You take it easy. He's one of us.
- Not any more

74
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,499
What's going on?

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,300
My orders are to take Almeida into custody.

76
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,100
That's straight from Brad Hammond at Division.

77
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,999
I am sorry, Tony

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,050
There's nothing we can do right now

79
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:38,100
Just take care of business, Jack

80
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,300
I'll be all right

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
He said you wanted to see me?

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
I need you to speak with your father.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,100
What do you want me to say?

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,550
Try and make it personal.

85
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,700
Try to connect with him.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Tell him you are scared that you don't want him to do this

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,100
I will try

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,400
I know what's going to happen, and I know you can stop it

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,600
Please

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,300
I wont let them use you to manipulate me

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
Despite everything that's happened

92
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,999
I love you

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,400
And I asking you, please don't let this happen

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,200
This doesn't make any sense.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,300
It doesn't make any sense to you because
you haven't seen what I have seen

96
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't understand

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,800
I know you think what happened to you is
the governments fault, and maybe it is

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
But the people who are going to die are innocent.

99
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Ant that's tragic, Jane.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,100
But it has to happen for things to change and they must change

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
How can you do something like this?

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
I am doing it for your sake

103
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,099
For my sake?

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,999
For you and your children

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
And after it, the world will be a better place

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,800
Please, Dad

107
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,600
Please

108
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Please, don't do this

109
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.

110
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,200
But one day you will

111
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
And you will look back and you will
thank me for what I have done

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,900
Yeah

113
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Oh, my god

114
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,100
Jane

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Jane

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
We are on the move, get the choppers ready

117
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,499
Hello

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,600
Sherry, Its David

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Hello, David

120
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I have been thinking things over

121
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,400
What Keeler offered you, how did you put it?

122
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,300
A seat at the table?

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,900
Yeah, something like that

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,300
Well, there my be a seat at my table.

125
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,700
Its a little too late for that, David

126
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,900
Sherry, I think its in both our best interests
for you to hear what I have to offer.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,100
All right, I am listening

128
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
No, not on the phone

129
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,200
In person

130
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,899
Where, then?

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,800
The Oakcliff Building, downtown

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,100
I know it

133
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
Good. I will meet you there in 25 minutes.

134
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,800
That's a short notice, David

135
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,000
But you will be there

136
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
You are in no position to be making demands here

137
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,999
Sherry, I have a schedule to keep.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If I start changing things around, it will attract
attention and I don't think either one of us wants that.

139
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,799
All right, David

140
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,900
I will hear what you have to say

141
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,700
Fine

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,100
Yeah

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,600
She should be leaving soon to meet me

144
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
I know shed go for it

145
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Oh, she's enjoying having me over a barrel.

146
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,900
I could hear it in her voice

147
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't worry about that, David

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,200
If we can find this prescription bottle,
all her leverage is gone.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
How long will you need in the house

150
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,700
The more time we have, the better
our chance of finding it

151
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,700
I will do whatever I can to keep her there with me

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,900
All right

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Wayne, find it

154
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,700
Take a look at your handiwork

155
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,200
You murdered these people, Stephen

156
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,400
Whole families

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Sometimes a fire needs to be lit
in order to put out another fire.

158
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't want to hear your justification

159
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,099
This is over

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,500
You are going to tell me how to find
the rest of the vials now

161
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Or you'll send me inside the hotel?

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I am prepared to die for my cause, Jack

163
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Yeah, I know

164
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,750
Chase
Yeah, Jack

165
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,200
Come in
Copy that

166
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,200
What are you doing, Jack?

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,250
Why did you bring me here?

168
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:14,000
Ask your father, its up to him

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
Dad?

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,850
Tell me how to find your couriers, Stephen

171
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,699
Or I am going to put her in that building

172
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,600
You wouldn't dare. She has nothing to do with this

173
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,999
Neither do the people in those body bags

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,900
I am going to do everything I have to stop you
from releasing more of this virus.

175
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,799
How could you do this?

176
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
I am going to give you one chance

177
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,700
You are not

178
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Tell me how I find them

179
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,000
You know you cant do this, Jack

180
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
You are a government agent

181
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Send her in

182
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
Take her inside now

183
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
No

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,300
Dad, stop them

185
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:51,800
Stop it

186
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,000
Dad, please

187
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,300
No, no, no

188
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,900
Everything that happens to your daughter is because of you.

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,099
Dad, stop, no, no, no

190
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,000
Get her out of there, Jack

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Jack, get her out of there

192
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,250
Where are the vials?

193
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,325
Get her out of there

194
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,400
How do I find the vials?

195
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,799
Dad

196
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,500
Let her go

197
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Do as I say now, Jack!

198
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,500
When your daughter is infected,
I am going to make you watch her die

199
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,400
Bauer, let her go

200
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Let her go

201
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,800
You are running out of time, Stephen

202
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,399
Stephen, you are out of time

203
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Stop, stop, stop, I will tell you

204
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Just don't harm her

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,700
How do I find the vials?

206
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Each one is tagged with a GPS locator chip so that I can
track them right up until t he moment they are released.

207
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,600
Where are the locator codes?

208
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,200
In my head

209
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,900
You memorized all 11?

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah, get her out of there

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Bring Jane out from the tunnel now.

212
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Let's go

213
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,500
Jack, we have picked up 10 of the 11
GPS signals coming off the vials.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,100
Why are we missing a signal?

215
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,900
I don't know. I gave you the correct codes.

216
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Where's the 11th vial?

217
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Los Angels

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,400
What's the target?

219
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,500
His instruction were to select a public place
where maximum casualties would be inflicted.

220
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,600
What's his name?

221
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,499
I know him as Arthur Rabens.

222
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,900
But I am assuming that's not his real name.

223
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
We need a description

224
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,700
Take him back to holding over at CTU.

225
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,500
I want him working with a sketch artist immediately.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,600
What about Jane?

227
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,200
She stays here

228
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,199
Kaufman

229
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Adam, its Jack

230
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,800
I need you to do an all agency search on the name Arthur Rabens.

231
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,300
Saunders believes it might be a alias

232
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,899
Ok, I am on it, Jack

233
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
Has district sent anyone over to replace Tony?

234
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,500
Actually, yeah, Brad Hammond just got here right now

235
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,000
Ok, let me speak to him

236
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:38,800
One second

237
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,899
Mr. Hammond

238
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
I have Jack Bauer for you on line 6

239
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,200
Good, thank you

240
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,400
Jack

241
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I have been briefed on CTU activity to this point

242
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,000
We are relaying the coordinates of the 10 vials
to local police, NHS and HazMat across the country

243
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,500
But we still cant lock on a signal from the 11th vial

244
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,400
The 11th vial is in Los Angeles.

245
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,299
The couriers name is Arthur Rabens

246
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
Although Saunders believes that that might be an alias.

247
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,600
There's no predetermined target

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,099
Did he tell you the truth

249
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah. Right now he thinks we are willing
to kill his daughter if he doesn't cooperate.

250
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:09,100
But our best bet is to lock on to that signal.

251
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
I understand everyone in comm. is working on it

252
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,800
Brad, I know you took Tony Almeida into custody.

253
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,200
But now that his wife is safe,
I think he might be a real asset to us.

254
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,400
I am sorry, Jack, but there's
not going to be any special treatment.

255
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,000
For Gods sakes, Brad

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,200
Four and a half years ago, I was put in the
exact same position as Tony's been put in today.

257
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Victor Darzen kidnapped my wife and daughter,
and I went outside of CTU to get them back.

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,300
And no one put me in prison.

259
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
The circumstances were different

260
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,499
And the outcome will be the same, we will prevail.

261
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,850
The entire operation was put at risk because of what he did

262
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:47,200
This operation started a year ago with Gael, Tony and myself.

263
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Gael gave his life, I became an addict just
to maintain my cover, and now you are sending Tony to prison?

264
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Its wrong

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,599
Brad, its wrong and you know it.

266
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,500
You should be putting a medal on him not handcuffs.

267
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,750
Jack, you can testify at his hearing.

268
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,700
Right now, we have got work to do.

269
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,500
Where's Michelle?

270
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,600
She's here

271
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Can I talk to her, please?

272
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,100
First thing first

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Plachecki's coming over from the attorney
Generals office to take your official statement.

274
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
You are entitled to have a lawyer present.

275
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,200
Look, I don't need a lawyer, Brad

276
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I did what I did

277
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,300
What you did, Tony, is punishable by the death penalty.

278
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
Death penalty

279
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,250
What did you expect?

280
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,700
You committed treason

281
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,499
That was not my intent.

282
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,300
You facilitated the escape of a man who was
responsible for the death of Ryan Chappell

283
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,399
and almost a thousand civilians,

284
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,699
who was contemplating killing millions of others.

285
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,400
Then you tried to neutralize the only leverage
we had over him, by giving him back his daughter.

286
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,900
So what's the bottom line?

287
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,500
I will testify to the fact that your service
record is long and for the most part, distinguished.

288
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,700
With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years

289
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,100
Sherry should have left by now

290
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,650
Yeah, well, she's taking her time

291
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,800
So she can make the President wait.

292
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Wayne Palmer

293
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,500
Wayne

294
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,000
I told you not to call me

295
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,299
I don't have anyone else

296
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,200
I am sorry, but I cant help you right now

297
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,500
The police are coming back to arrest me,
Wayne, for murdering Alan

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Because they don't believe that Sherry was here

299
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,199
I know what happened

300
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Then why didn't you tell them the truth?

301
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,700
My lawyer says that the President is backing Sherry's story.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Is it true?

303
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,000
Is your brother covering for Sherry?

304
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I don't know, Julia.

305
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,599
Don't lie to me

306
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
Listen, I am sorry, but there's nothing
I can do for you right now.

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Please

308
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,299
Just don't, don't hang up.

309
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,400
I will call you as soon as I can, I promise

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
Wayne

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I am so scared

312
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
I know, I know

313
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
We loved each other once

314
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,700
Help me

315
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,400
I have to go, Julia

316
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:36,899
Wayne

317
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,600
I am sorry

318
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,400
Chief of Staff to the President of the
United States and I am committing a burglary

319
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,100
It's an historic moment

320
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Foxton, Sherry can never know we were here.

321
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,300
You do what I say, and she wont

322
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Lets get to work

323
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,000
Jack

324
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,600
This is the tactical feed from San Francisco

325
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,100
They are apprehending Saunders courier.

326
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,350
He's not breathing

327
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:55,499
He's been neutralized

328
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,600
Sniper took him down with a head shot.

329
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,900
We have got it

330
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,999
The vial is intact.

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Repeat, we have the vial

332
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
One down, 10 to go

333
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,350
You check the kitchen?

334
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,475
Yeah, for the second time

335
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,600
There is nothing there

336
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Well, it looks like Mrs. Palmer
believes in better living through chemistry.

337
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,500
But none of the bottles are Milliken's.

338
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,900
Damn it

339
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,300
Relax

340
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
If she's hidden it here, well find it.

341
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,400
How can you be so sure?

342
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,500
Because she's not a professional, and I am

343
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,550
Sherry

344
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,400
David

345
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,999
Lets take a walk

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, actually, I just wanted to get to the point

347
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,000
What is it that you have decided?

348
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,500
I decided to give you what you want

349
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
A place in my administration

350
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Well, that's what you implied over the phone, but I thought
I was here so that you could be a little more specific.

351
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,700
You will be my de facto right hand,
involved in all major decisions.

352
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,100
Involved how?

353
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,300
On everything from ambassadorial appointments
to legislative proposals,

354
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:57,300
you will be one of my primary consultants.

355
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,300
One of your consultants?

356
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,000
Right

357
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,000
Good-bye, David

358
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Why? Where are you going?

359
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,200
Back home, because this conversation is over.

360
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,999
Why?

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,399
That's just not good enough

362
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I am not going to be relegated to some informal
role so that you can ignore me whenever you choose.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,700
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,100
I want a permanent position, David,
in your administration and in your life.

365
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,200
I don't understand

366
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,300
I want to be your wife again

367
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,999
You what?

368
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,900
I don't expect to have the kind of physical
intimacy that we used to have,

369
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,599
although maybe in time that will come,

370
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,599
but I really want be Mrs. David Palmer again

371
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,400
The first lady, right by your
side in Washington wherever you go

372
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
Sherry, I don't know what to say.

373
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,800
You can start by saying yes

374
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Or I walk for good

375
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Are you prepared to have me be your wife again?

376
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,300
Yes

377
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Really?

378
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Oh, David

379
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,100
Oh, God

380
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,000
We should talk about the details.

381
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,499
Work out a timeline

382
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,300
How we expose this to the public

383
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
Wait a minute

384
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
I know you a little better than this, David

385
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,599
Something's not right here.

386
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,099
You are making this all too easy

387
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,500
There's, there's something else going on

388
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,000
I am giving you what you asked for.

389
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,600
No, no, no, you are not

390
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
You are toying with me

391
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
And I don't know why, and frankly, I don't care

392
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,300
You just consider my offer rescinded.

393
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,500
John Keeler will be the next
President of the United States.

394
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,699
Yeah

395
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
She's on her way back

396
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,999
David, we need more time

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We haven't found anything yet

398
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,500
Look, I tried to keep her here as long as I could,

399
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,100
but she knew something was wrong

400
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Wayne, you should leave

401
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,499
We are not done

402
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,000
She will be there soon, you have no choice

403
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,200
David, hold on

404
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,700
There's a safe

405
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,500
David, we found a safe in a hidden cellar.

406
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,600
Can you open it in time?

407
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,699
Can you get in?

408
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,300
Its an Evans Stoller, so forget about cracking it

409
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,650
All these electronic safes have
manufacturer override codes.

410
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:18,600
I have a guy who can get them for us.
One of them will work

411
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,200
How long

412
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,500
Depends on how long it takes to get him on the phone

413
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,100
David, we may have just found a way.

414
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
You'd better. You are running out of time.

415
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,100
The suspect has used a titanium clamp to
secure the device to a railing.

416
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:33,100
We are defusing on the site

417
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,150
Wilson, what's your status?

418
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,199
The suspect's in custody

419
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
New York Times' men's around. Virus is contained

420
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:39,999
Yeah

421
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Seattle, Las Vegas' secured,
suspect's taken down making a phone call

422
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:44,200
Ok, hold on

423
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,650
Jack, we got the couriers in Las Vegas
and Seattle without incident.

424
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:49,800
But Saunders man in Denver was making
a phone call when he was killed.

425
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,200
Did he complete the call? Did he warn the other couriers?

426
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,100
We don't know

427
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,000
We got to find that out

428
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,500
Chloe, I am getting a level 2 SAT
transmission from the LA grid

429
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,500
Are you sure? What are the coordinates?

430
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,399
Alpha 1733 at Delta 401

431
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,300
That's downtown. Lock in on the SAT field

432
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,199
Its done

433
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Transfer to my screen

434
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,900
Ok

435
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,750
This is Jack

436
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:20,500
Jack, its Chloe

437
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,300
What do you got?

438
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Saunders is telling the truth

439
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:24,000
Rabens is in Los Angeles.

440
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,999
Where?

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
He's on south Flower heading northwest.

442
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,700
We got a location

443
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,599
I want you to extrapolate his path.

444
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Cross reference it with a list of probably public targets.

445
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,999
Already done

446
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
The most likely match is the California Center.

447
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:36,800
A mall makes sense.

448
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,300
I want you to get units over there to
evacuate and secure the area. We are on our way.

449
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,000
I just tried to see Tony

450
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,600
Security said you are denying me access.

451
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,300
He's a prisoner, Michelle.

452
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm his wife. He did what he did to save my life

453
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:09,800
I am aware of that

454
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
And because of that he's being charged with treason.

455
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,000
Treason?

456
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,200
Brad, look, I know that he broke protocol
by taking Jane Saunders out of CTU,

457
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,800
But he would never have given her up

458
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,899
Because of him, we were able to catch Saunders

459
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,400
We had Saunders 2 hours ago, and Tony let him escape

460
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,700
No one told you?

461
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,700
We had Saunders trapped in a building downtown.

462
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,300
We were ready to drop the net, and Tony pulled
unites out of position so Saunders could get away.

463
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
Brad, it was an impossible choice

464
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:47,100
No, it wasn't

465
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,000
Tony has a sworn duty to protect the people of this country

466
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:54,300
Putting your life first was treasons

467
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,600
And he's going to prison for it.

468
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,699
Brad

469
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,800
I want you to put yourself in his place, Michelle.

470
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,000
If you would have made the same call,
you should resign right now.

471
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,400
The target is still moving north at 40 miles per hour

472
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:19,500
How long until we intercept?

473
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,100
About a minute

474
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,800
How are we doing on the other vials?

475
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,800
They got the Flagstaff couriers and
the other 2 in Washington.

476
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:27,900
Rabens is the last one.

477
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,699
Ok, make your next right.

478
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,800
You should be coming up right behind him.

479
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Ok, I am turning right onto Flower.

480
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,000
The target is less than a block ahead of you.

481
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:40,800
You should have a visual.

482
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,300
Chloe, there's no vehicles within range.

483
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,500
Are you sure the targets still in the vehicle?

484
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Of course, he's traveling 40 miles per hour

485
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:49,799
You are closing

486
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,600
Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you

487
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,500
There's no cars in front of us, Chloe.
You need to recheck your signals.

488
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,500
Its not possible

489
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Yes, it is

490
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
He's underneath us

491
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,799
Chloe, the targets on the subway

492
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Can you access the MTA's disaster response system?

493
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,699
Yes, we can access their control center directly.

494
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,800
Ok, we need to stop the train in the
tunnel before it hits the station.

495
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Logging onto their system.

496
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,500
Has Adam been able to turn up a photo on Rabens yet?

497
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,700
No, and Saunders hasn't completed the identity sketch.

498
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Ok, they're accepting my request to stop
the train in the tunnel just short of the station.

499
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,500
Do you want me to tell MTA to close the station?

500
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:28,599
No, absolutely not.

501
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
If Rabens notices anything out of
the ordinary, he might release the virus.

502
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I am going to need 20 personnel undercover
and a backup HazMat team ASAP.

503
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Okay, we've got men nearby.

504
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,700
I will tell Hammond to order the redeployment.

505
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,999
Yeah, Foxton here.

506
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
I've got this codes for the safe.

507
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,200
Ok, give me the first one

508
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
That didn't work

509
00:30:58,301 --> 00:30:59,299
Got another one?

510
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,400
Come on, come on, come on

511
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,000
Did you hear that?

512
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
There's a car coming

513
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,400
no

514
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,700
Sherry is here

515
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,499
Look, I need you to be quiet

516
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,700
We need to get the hell out of here

517
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:27,200
Quiet

518
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,000
The next one

519
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,400
Damn it, Foxton, come on

520
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
Got it

521
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,700
Its not here

522
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,500
All right, come on.

523
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,500
That's it, lets go

524
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,200
What?

525
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,900
I didn't come this far to leave empty handed.

526
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,700
Wayne

527
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,700
What's going on here?

528
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Answer me. What?

529
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
Oh, now I understand why David wanted to meet me.

530
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,400
But I am so surprised to find
you here doing his dirty work.

531
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,300
I have never done anything to hurt you, Wayne

532
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:23,000
David put you up to this, didn't he?

533
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,800
Sherry, I¡­

534
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,600
Answer me, David put¡­

535
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:23,600
There will be a short delay
due to a stalled train ahead.

536
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,900
Chase, what's your location?

537
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,800
I am covering the east side of the tracks

538
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:30,699
Copy that.

539
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,600
Chase, I've got a visual on you coming down the stairs.

540
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,500
Everything in place with the MTA?

541
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,000
They are ready to move the train into the station.

542
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
Team A and B, are you in position?

543
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:45,900
Roger. We are in position.

544
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Rabens' description

545
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,400
white male, dark hair, brown eyes, none descript

546
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,899
Chloe, release the train

547
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,300
Release the hold on the train, release the train

548
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,800
Train doors are opening

549
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,100
The target is moving off the train

550
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,500
North or south?

551
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,300
North

552
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,799
Target is moving north

553
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,600
All teams remain in your zones.

554
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,999
- Chloe
- go ahead

555
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
can you check the altitude on a GPS signal?

556
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
If I triangulate.

557
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,900
Positive, target is changing altitude.

558
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:27,100
Target is moving upstairs.

559
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
We have got 10 remaining white males.

560
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
Target is now moving west

561
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Team A, split off and maintain pace.

562
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,150
Target is now moving south.

563
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,700
Target is now descending.

564
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,300
He's heading to the Seventh Street exit

565
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,900
Coming right towards you, Jack

566
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Target is heading south

567
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,500
I got a visual. 4 white remaining males.

568
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,800
I want all teams to start closing in.

569
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,500
I repeat, all teams start closing in

570
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,050
What have you got, Chloe?

571
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,100
Target is now moving west

572
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Target has stopped moving

573
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,200
The target has stopped

574
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,400
I have identification on the target

575
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
White male at my 6 o'clock.

576
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,050
He's looking at the map

577
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:46,400
I am initiating takedown

578
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,200
Drop the bag

579
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,100
Get on the ground, now. Don't move

580
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:56,700
What's going on?

581
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,300
Where is it?

582
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,400
Where's what?

583
00:36:58,401 --> 00:36:59,200
Where is it?

584
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,300
Chase

585
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

586
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,350
I have got the signal.

587
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,399
Should we wait for HazMat

588
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,600
No, its either in the vial or
we are already contaminated.

589
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,600
What is this?

590
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,000
Those aren't mine. I don't even¡­

591
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:26,400
Shut up

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Son of a bitch

593
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,300
Its just the transmitter

594
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:36,399
This isn't Rabens.

595
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
He knows we are on to him

596
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:38,550
He's still got the vial

597
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:39,700
Shut the station down, now

598
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,400
Julia

599
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,700
Stay here, I will be right back

600
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Where are you going?

601
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
Just stay here

602
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,700
Julia, what are you doing here?

603
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,300
The police think I killed Alan

604
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut

605
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,200
Its nobody's fault but your own

606
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,700
What are you doing with a gun?

607
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,199
You don't want to do this

608
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,500
I am going to jail for the rest
of my life because of you

609
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,400
Julia

610
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,699
Julia

611
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,500
That isn't true, Julia

612
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,300
No, wait. Relax. We're alright here.

613
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,099
You got to put that gun down

614
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,800
No, no, she's the one who should be going to jail

615
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,650
My life is ruined, don't you understand that?

616
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:52,300
Julia, please, we can, we can work this out

617
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:52,999
He's right

618
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,450
We can work it out

619
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:55,900
Shut up, shut up

620
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,100
You have been lying your entire life

621
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,700
You are not going to lie your way out of this

622
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,700
You are right

623
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,600
But right now, Julia, I am telling you the truth

624
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I will go to David and he will pardon you.

625
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:12,400
Now, I was just with him, just now

626
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,500
I am going to be his wife again.

627
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:15,700
He will do whatever I say

628
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,000
I promise you, you will not spend one day in jail

629
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,100
Isn't that so, Wayne?

630
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,600
Julie, listen, you will have everything you have always wanted.

631
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,000
You will have your freedom, you'll have Alan's estate.

632
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,400
You just think about it, sweetie

633
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,700
I promise, you will be set for life

634
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,500
Good, good. That is real good

635
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,600
That's good

636
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
My God. Sherry.

637
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,900
I am so sorry

638
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,000
No!

639
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,400
Oh, God, no, please

640
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,400
Take up position at the end of the platform.

641
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,900
Jack, we have detained everyone in the station.

642
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:02,899
We shut it down in time

643
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,299
No ones left since the train came in

644
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,500
Ok, set up a team and start searching the tunnels.

1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,699
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,100
You have already been briefed
on the Cordilla Virus

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,399
that's now threatening our cities.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,350
A vial of that virus has
already been release.

5
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,299
We discovered the identity of
the perpetrator.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,500
His name is Stephen Saunders and
he is a former MI6 agent.

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,850
In 32 countries across the
Middle East and Asia,

8
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,200
your government employs
intelligence consultants.

9
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,499
Theyre spies.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,100
In 45 minutes, I want a list of
their identities.

11
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,999
If you fail to comply,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,400
I will release 2 vials of the
virus in major cities.

13
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,300
Looks like Saunders has a daughter.

14
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,599
A daughter?

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,599
We know she is 19 years old, she goes
to school in Santa Barbara.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,200
I was just about to call the Santa
Barbara office to have her picked up.

17
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,699
Tony, thats not the right play.

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,199
If you want to grab her for questioning,

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,100
you are going to have to do it
without him knowing,

20
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,000
which means we have to conduct
a plain sight swap.

21
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,700
Switch her out with one of our own agents.

22
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:59,299
Ok, lets see her.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Kim, you are not going to fool anyone
who knows Jan Saunders up close

24
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:08,300
I know.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,599
Clear

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,599
You think I am playing a game here with you?

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,299
Hundreds of thousands of peoples
lives are on the line.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,300
You have no idea how far I am willing
to go to acquire your cooperation.

29
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:24,600
Where is your father, Jane?

30
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,599
I don't know.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,500
Could you help me find something on this aisle?

32
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,799
Yeah, no problem.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,700
Call for help and I will kill you right now.

34
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:34,050
Kim?

35
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,400
Damn it.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Saunders is going to know we have his daughter.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,100
The following takes place
between 8:00 am and 9:00 am.

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,899
These are the quarantine zones
that were set up an hour ago.

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Since then, 2 new symptomatic patients were discovered
at an ER in Silver Lake and one in Hancock Park.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Those 2 cases engendered 5 new quarantine areas.

41
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,999
Thats 3% of the city.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,700
If containment isnt total,
it will grow exponentially.

43
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:14,700
All right, thanks Adam.

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,299
We are all tired, I know that.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,600
And some of you have been working
for 24 hours straight.

46
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,900
I dont have to tell you how serious
the situation is,

47
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,799
but we can't drift.

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,500
If there ever was a worst case scenario, this is it.

49
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,499
We are in it.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,799
Everyone has to stay on point.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
We have switched from prevention to containment.

52
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:42,000
The virus is out.

53
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,700
You all right?

54
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:57,299
Yeah, I am fine.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,100
I am sorry it had to go down like this.

56
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,200
The man I shot, is he dead?

57
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:07,399
Yeah.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,999
What's going to happen now?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Saunders is going to know we have Jane.

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,999
This is Jack.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
Jack, its Forrester.
The Saunders girl is calmed down.

62
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,700
You can try talking to her again.

63
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,299
Ok, thanks, Rachel.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
We will see what we can get from the daughter.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
I understand that, Tony.
So you'll tell him?

66
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:37,099
Yeah, I will tell him.

67
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,600
I want every precaution taken.
I'll get back to you.

68
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah.

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,299
What's going on with Jack Bauer?

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,099
The operation wasn't completely successful.

71
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Now, David, they do have Saunders daughter,
but they were unable to remain covert.

72
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,599
So, Saunders knows we have her?

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,800
No, not yet, but CTU is estimating he
will find out within the hour.

74
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,399
What's Jacks plan?

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,100
Use Saunders daughter, try to locate him.

76
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,099
David, listen.

77
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,399
The deadline for his next demand is
gonna be up here in about 15 minutes.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,300
Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll is an act of treason.

79
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,999
I know that.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,800
But he will release more of the virus if we dont.

81
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:21,299
So what do you want to do?

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,300
I want to see what Bauer gets out of
Saunders daughter first.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,399
You know what just happened?

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
A man who your father hired to protect
you just tried to kill one of my agents.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,299
So, you killed him, right?

86
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,700
A man that worked for my father.

87
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,000
You are a smart girl, Jane.

88
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:51,999
Look out in that room.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Everyone here is a federal agent whose job i
t is to protect the lives of American citizens.

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,299
Jane, I know how hard it must be for you to believe

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
everything that everybodys been
telling you about your father.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,099
But I am going to show you something
that will change your mind.

93
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,900
And the sooner you stop resisting me,
the sooner you can help us start saving lives.

94
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,999
Why are you putting all this on me?

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,599
Because you are Stephen Saunders daughter.

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,499
And unfortunately, you are the only
leverage we have against him.

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,200
You cant just say these outrageous
things and expect me to believe you.

98
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,499
I know.

99
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Truth is, I know your father.

100
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,100
I worked with him.

101
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,450
He was a good man.

102
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,799
He was a brave man.

103
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,499
But something has happened to him.

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,300
All I care about right now is stopping
him from doing what he is doing.

105
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:51,300
I can't do that without you.
I need your help.

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,400
Palmer still hasn't sent the list yet.

107
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,499
He has 15 more minutes.

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,900
CTU has been trying to use IP locators
to get at your through the domain name.

109
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,300
We've protected it though, right?

110
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,800
Yes. It's a dead end

111
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,800
Good.

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Thank you.

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,350
I am going to show you who your father really is.

114
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,099
These photographs were taken over 8 years ago.

115
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,300
Your father told your mother that he
was going to Europe on a fact finding mission.

116
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,300
But the truth of the matter is,
we were both part of a special forces unit

117
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,300
that was dispatched to Kosovo to
kill a man named Victor Drazen.

118
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,699
This is where the mission ended, Drazens hideout.

119
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,699
When I left Kosovo, I believed your
father had died in the blast.

120
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,600
The British government told your mother
that thats where he died, too.

121
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,500
But recently,
we discovered through phone records

122
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,100
that your father had contacted you 4 years ago

123
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,700
to tell you he was still alive.Is that right?

124
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:57,399
Yes

125
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,900
A couple of months after my mother died,
I get a call from him.

126
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,200
He said he was living in Europe
under an assumed name.

127
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:08,899
And that nobody knew he was alive.

128
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,800
And for his protection, I couldn't
tell anyone that I had spoken to him.

129
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:17,700
Did he ever tell you why he had contacted
you after so many years?

130
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,999
Yes.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,999
He missed me.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,499
I understand that.

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,300
Over the last 3 to 4 hours,
we have been pooling data from Interpol.

134
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,999
Here are some more recent images.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,900
This is your father with Sayed Ali,
a known weapon dealer in the Middle East.

136
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,200
Here you see his meeting with Ari Consul,
a biologist from Jakarta

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,200
who is now spending the rest of his life in prison
for the manufacturing of illegal biological weapons.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,700
This doesn't prove anything. He could have been
meeting with these people for any number of reasons.

139
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:55,500
I will play you an audio file, one of three
that we got from your father earlier today.

140
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,499
This is your father talking to the
President of the United States.

141
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
...Working against these countries at
the behest of the American military machine.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,100
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities
sent to me by way of a website, sylviaimports.com

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,500
If you fail to comply, I will release
2 vials of the virus in major cities.

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,199
2 more vials of the virus.
He has already released one.

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,100
This is a live video feed from the
Chandler Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles,

146
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,100
where your father ordered the release of
one if the vials of the virus

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,100
into the ventilation system of the hotel.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,900
The people that you are looking at will
all be dead within the next 2 to 3 hours.

149
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,800
There is almost 800 of them,jane

150
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,800
This is how they will die.

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I don't want to see any more.

152
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,700
I don't want to see any more, either.

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
You can help us stop this, Jane, please.

154
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,200
Please.

155
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
I have a phone number.

156
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,100
He told me to call it day or night
if I ever got in trouble.

157
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,700
Have you ever used it before?

158
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,700
No.

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
We need it.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
No.

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,999
No.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,100
It's a mistake.

163
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,600
I am ok.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
I don't have any infection.

165
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,400
No. Don't take me in there with those people.

166
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,700
I don't want to die.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
Please.

168
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I don't want to die.

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,499
Michelle, I just got a call.

170
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Your lab results are on the way here.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
I am sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,500
What's this? Aaron?

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Our bureau chief just informed me that
NHS believes Los Angeles is no longer safe.

174
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,300
We would like to move you out of the state.

175
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,000
I appreciate your concern.

176
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,200
Tell Chief Kurtzman,
I'd rather manage matters from here.

177
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,400
Sir, I am afraid this isn't a request.

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Excuse me.

179
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,899
Secret service is invoking section 32.

180
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,900
For your own protection, we are requiring
you to accompany us to Air Force One.

181
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,399
You are ordering me?

182
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,500
Yes sir. It's for your safety.

183
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,600
Wayne?

184
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,900
I don't know the specifics of the code,
but secret service is invoking it.

185
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,200
And here in LA, the threat is serious.

186
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,899
It's serious everywhere.

187
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,700
At least here, we know what we are facing.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
Who has to sign off on this, Aaron?

189
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,000
Chief Kurtzman and myself.

190
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
I'd like a word in private with you, Aaron.

191
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,800
Sir, I am sorry for appearing to overstep my bounds.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,500
But it's my job to protect you.

193
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,500
Listen, Aaron.

194
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,800
You have been with me from the beginning.

195
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,000
You don't have to apologize for doing your job.

196
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,300
But this crisis will end.

197
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,500
And the people in this city and this country will be stronger,
knowing that their president stood by them shoulder to shoulder.

198
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,700
I am asking you as a friend and a fellow citizen

199
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Protect me, but here in Los Angeles.

200
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
Can you do that for me?

201
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes, sir. For you I can.

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Thank you

203
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,700
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,400
Mr. President the conference call is about to begin.

205
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,050
Jack, you there?

206
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, I am on.

207
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,200
Mr. President?

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,199
Mr. Almeida, I understand.

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,900
We may have a way to locate this man,
Stephen Saunders.

210
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,200
We do, sir. However, my technical staff just informed me that
to do this properly, it may take 15 minutes, possibly longer.

211
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,800
So there is no way we can get to
him in the next few minutes?

212
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:51,900
No, sir. There's not.

213
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,500
Ok, gentlemen, time is upon us.

214
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,300
Having considered all the possible scenarios,
I see no other choice than to draw our line in the sand.

215
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,400
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.

216
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,299
Mr. President, I hope you understand
that leaves us with only one option.

217
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,900
That's to use Stephen Saunders' daughter
as a hostage and hope that will stop him.

218
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,200
I understand.

219
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,700
All right, gentlemen, get to it.

220
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:21,300
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,400
David, are you sure we are doing the right thing?

222
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,500
The only thing I am sure of is we can't let
this country be taken over by this madman.

223
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,900
Jack, how do you want to do this?

224
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,700
How long do we have to keep him
on the line so we can run a trace?

225
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,900
About a minute.

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Ok, we need to cover our bases.

227
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,500
We will use Jane to try and keep him on the line.
If we have to jump in, we will.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
All right, look, I will initiate the trace.
You tell Jane what we need her to do.

229
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,200
I will get back to you.

230
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,700
Damn it.

231
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
What's happening?

232
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,200
We have run out of time.
We need you to call your father.

233
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,299
And tell him what?

234
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,000
Anything. We just want you to
keep him on the line.

235
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,700
For how long?

236
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
At least a minute.

237
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Do you think you do that?

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
I need to think about it.

239
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Jane, we don't have anymore time.

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,900
Your father just threatened to release more
of the virus in the next few minutes.

241
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,900
Is the list up, yet?

242
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,800
No.

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,900
Well, his time is up.

244
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,150
Yeah?

245
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:35,800
It's me.

246
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,700
Release San Francisco.

247
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,300
That's my daughter's line.

248
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:44,300
Ian, wait.

249
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,400
I will call you right back.

250
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
Find out where this is coming from.

251
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,100
Jane?

252
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah.

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Hi, Dad.

254
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,999
What's wrong?

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,900
I told you only to use
this number in an emergency.

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I want to see you. I am scared.

257
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
All the airports are shut down, and the news
channels are talking about the alert level being raised.

258
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Just, just stay where you are, honey.

259
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,800
You'll be fine.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Someone is monitoring the call.

261
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,300
Hang on a second, honey.

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Are you sure?

263
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,899
Yes

264
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
The signal is splitting.

265
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,500
They've got her.

266
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,100
Jack, we just got a hit on the trace route.

267
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
He knows we are on the phone.

268
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,299
What do I do when he gets back on?

269
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Nothing. You are doing great.
Just keep talking.

270
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Jane.

271
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,300
Yes, Dad.

272
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,600
There's a man named Jack Bauer
with you, isn't there?

273
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,900
What, Dad?

274
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Hand the phone to him.

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,199
Dad

276
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,100
You heard me.

277
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I am on the line, Stephen.

278
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:13,300
Jack, you know how many vials I have,
and what I am capable of.

279
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,100
And you know what I am capable of, too.

280
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,999
Did you get a lock on the signal?

281
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
It's dead. We are negative
for passive triangulation.

282
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,099
Tony, did you get him?

283
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,099
We are working on it, Adam?

284
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,900
I have got 2 microwaves that can give me a
longitude reading, but I don't have the latitude yet.

285
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:38,500
Here, try this.

286
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,699
Adam?

287
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,300
I am trying, Tony. I am working on it.

288
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,100
Ok, here it is: 21904 Collins.

289
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
We have got him, Jack.
We will send teams from here.

290
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,100
Ok. Patch the location through to the chopper.

291
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:58,900
We will be airborne in minutes.

292
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,899
Get me Chase.

293
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,100
We got a location. Tell the chopper to come in.

294
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,799
I want you to assemble the team.

295
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Take Jane back to CTU.
I want her fully protected.

296
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,900
What are you going to do to my father?

297
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,600
I am going to stop him.

298
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
I want you to go with her.

299
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,400
Michelle

300
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,200
The test results, they just came in.

301
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,200
Thank you.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,600
Almeida

303
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,100
Honey, it's me.

304
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
What's going on?

305
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,700
I am ok.

306
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,900
I am not infected.

307
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,700
Are you sure?

308
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,700
Yeah. They did AA swab and a
blood test and I am going to be fine.

309
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,800
I am going to be fine.

310
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, my god.

311
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, my god, sweetheart, that's fantastic.

312
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,100
Look, I want you to get out of there right now.

313
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,400
Ok? Away from anybody who's infected.

314
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,499
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.

315
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,600
They said those of us that didn't come down with
the infection, that we have an immunity to the virus.

316
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,200
Well, where are they taking you?

317
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,100
Downtown, to NHS.

318
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,800
They want to keep us under watch for 18 hours.

319
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,800
But they said it's just a formality.

320
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,400
All right, look. I will get
there as soon as I can, all right?

321
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,899
No, no.

322
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,600
Stay where you are. They need you at CTU.

323
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,700
I can work from downtown.

324
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Honey, you don't have to work.

325
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
We can handle it from here.

326
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,900
I want to help, Tony.

327
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,200
Ok

328
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Michelle

329
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah

330
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't believe I almost lost you.

331
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,800
I almost lost you, too.

332
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,100
But we are still here.

333
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,200
Yeah.

334
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,400
I have to go.

335
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,800
I will call you from NHS.
Hey...

336
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
I love you

337
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,600
I love you so much.

338
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,599
Excuse me, everybody,
can I have your attention, please?

339
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,500
The President has asked you to this informal setting
without cameras or recording devices

340
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,500
to tell you what relationship, if any the outbreak at the Chandler Plaza Hotel has with the airport closures.

341
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:03,600
Was the Chandler Plaza the reason yellow level was raised?

342
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:05,100
The President will deal with that in his statement.

343
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,400
So Saunders knows we have his daughter.

344
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:12,299
Yeah.

345
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Found out about 5 minutes ago.

346
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,700
How did he react?

347
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,900
He broke off communication.

348
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,900
The good news is, CTU has position of Saunders,
and they are sending in teams now.

349
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,400
What's our confidence level?

350
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,900
David, this man knows our system, our protocols.

351
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,300
He is going to be tough to corner.

352
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,600
Stay on top of our emergency response teams.

353
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
The abduction of his daughter
may have made things worse.

354
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,100
The President of United States.

355
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,300
Please be seated.

356
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
As you know, this morning our
alert level was raised to red.

357
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
We do have information regarding a
possible biological attack on American soil.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,600
We have maximized our preparedness across the nation.

359
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Now the best way for our citizens to
insure their own safety is to stay home.

360
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,099
If you are at work, go home.

361
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,899
That's the message I hope the media can convey.

362
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,600
Mr. President, we have heard reports that the local
British intelligence office was attacjed a couple hours ago.

363
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Is that related?

364
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
I can't release any details on that right now.

365
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,700
I am sorry. Mr. President, the people of the
city of Los Angeles are starting to panic.

366
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,799
And information is not
following from this office.

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,400
We have had major outbreaks, we have had
quarantines, and now a hint of biological terror

368
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,399
Carol, Please

369
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,100
No. Gerry, no. The President has
got to be more forthcoming.

370
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,500
It's ok

371
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,100
The President has to be in control,
and so do you.

372
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,900
If you want to help the public and do your jobs best,
sit quietly and listen to what I have to say.

373
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,900
Biological agents do their worst damage
where large groups of people congregate.

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,900
The best defense we have right now is to encourage everyone
to go home and stay home and await further instructions.

375
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
Chase, it's Jack. Are you en route?

376
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,599
Yeah, I am a little more than 10 minutes out.

377
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,900
Jack, what are the chances Saunders
knows we have his location?

378
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Not likely. Saunders will think he had 90 seconds more
of talk time before we could ever lock onto this location.

379
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Look, I want you to move your teams into position
and remind local law enforcement to stay out of sight.

380
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,400
We can't tip him off.

381
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:19,900
Done.

382
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,800
Adam, I want you to keep an eye on the satellite, track anyone coming in and out
of that building, and feed all that information over to local law enforcement.

383
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,099
You copy?

384
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
I am watching the data now, Jack.

385
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Ok, plug Chloe into it, too.

386
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:31,899
Yeah.

387
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,600
Listen, everybody, this is our time. Get it right.

388
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,900
Stephen, we have to leave.

389
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:38,700
We are not leaving.

390
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Why not?

391
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
You said they probably have our location now.

392
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,300
Not probably. They do.

393
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,800
I don't understand.

394
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
They have got us on satellite.

395
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,400
They will pick us up if we try to leave now.

396
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
So we sit around here and
wait till they surround us?

397
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:52,300
Exactly.

398
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
The more bodies they send,
the easier it will be for us to disappear.

399
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,800
No. I am not waiting around to get caught.

400
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Osterlind

401
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,200
I am leaving, Stephen.

402
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,199
Yeah.

403
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Has she left, yet?

404
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:26,600
No.

405
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,300
She will.

406
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,400
Stay on her.

407
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,600
We are going to need to do this soon.

408
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,100
Ok

409
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,000
Where are we going?

410
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,100
Los Angeles.

411
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,300
I thought your father said
there was an outbreak there.

412
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,500
Where we are going,
it'll be safe. Don't worry.

413
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
Where in Los Angeles are they taking me?

414
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,500
A place called CTU.

415
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,100
CTU?

416
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,199
Yeah.

417
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Counter Terrorist Unit.

418
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I still can't believe this.

419
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,800
That my father is a terrorist.

420
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,300
4 years ago, when I found out
he was alive after all that time, I was so happy.

421
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,800
I had a father.

422
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
I let myself believe all that he wanted me to.

423
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,200
That he was this wonderful man.

424
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,700
How often did you see him?

425
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,000
Couple times a year.

426
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Sometimes he'd surprise me.

427
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,800
And he'd always bring me something

428
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
And it was always perfect.

429
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Like he knew.

430
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,700
Maybe he did know.

431
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,200
What do you mean?

432
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,600
He had people watching you, Jane.

433
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,900
He knew more about your life
than you are probably aware of.

434
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,000
What am I supposed to do with
all these feeling for him?

435
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,300
The person I love doesn't even exist.

436
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,600
What's going to happen to him?

437
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,200
My dad's going to try and bring him in.

438
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,199
Adam, it's Jack.

439
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,600
What's the status of Saunders' location?

440
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,100
I am watching it now, Jack.
No one's left the building.

441
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,200
Who's working with us?

442
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,899
LAPD has set up a staging
area about a block away.

443
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,700
They have surrounded the area
and are hidden from view.

444
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,699
Ok, good work.

445
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,900
Tell them I will be there in a few minutes.

446
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:29,900
All right.

447
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah.

448
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,700
You're absolutely sure.

449
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,700
Thank you very much.

450
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,100
Tony, I need to talk to you.

451
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:47,900
Yeah, just a second.

452
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,600
Why don't you go ahead and put
these simulations on my system.

453
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:51,500
I need to talk to you right now.

454
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,000
I will catch up. Go ahead.

455
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,399
What's it?

456
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I have been working on the tented
quarantine area, you know.

457
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,400
And?

458
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,500
I have been going over the list of people who
have been isolated and I found a familiar name.

459
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
And?

460
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,600
One of them was Sarah Kaufman.

461
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Who is Sarah Kaufman?

462
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:13,600
Adam's sister.

463
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,599
You are sure it's Adam's sister?

464
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,100
Yeah. She tested positive in the medical sense.

465
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:23,000
She's going to die.

466
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,200
All right, thanks.

467
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
You are not going to tell him, are you?

468
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:30,800
Yeah, I have to.

469
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,799
But we still have a lot of work to do.

470
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,600
I mean, how can he concentrate knowing
that his sister gonna die in a couple hours?

471
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:36,400
Did you ever think about that?

472
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,000
Chloe, I am getting real tired of your personality.

473
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
I am just trying to help.

474
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,800
You want to help? Get back to work.

475
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,799
Adam, could you come with me a second?

476
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,100
I am sitting on these satellite
feeds for Jack right now.Can it wait?

477
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,400
No, it can't.

478
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Chloe will watch it.

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,399
Fine. What is it?

480
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,700
Tony, I really have to stay on this.

481
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
It's personal. Just come with me.

482
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,500
Tony, whatever it is, just tell me.
Did I do anything wrong?

483
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:12,900
No.

484
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,000
I am afraid I have some bad news for you.

485
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,700
Your sister, Sarah,
is in one of the quarantine zones.

486
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,600
What?

487
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
You have a sister named Sarah, right?

488
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,100
Yeah.

489
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,000
But how can they be sure that it's her?
There have to a hundred Sarah Kaufman.in Los Angeles.

490
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,100
Chloe confirmed it.

491
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
Have they kept her away from
the people that are infected?

492
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
She's infected.

493
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,899
What are you saying, Tony?

494
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Are you telling me that
Sarah's going to die?

495
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,400
It looks that way, yeah.

496
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,600
I am sorry.

497
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,600
Oh, my god.

498
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:02,600
Adam, I am going to give you a chance to talk to your sister, but
then I am going to need you to stay on until the crisis passes.

499
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,000
You think you can do that?

500
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,500
Adam

501
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,200
Because we need you here.

502
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah.

503
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,100
All right.

504
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,300
No, I am completely surrounded.

505
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,500
How do you know?

506
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,000
There was a security guard across the
street making his rounds every 15 minutes.

507
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:44,600
He missed his last rotation,
which means CTU has taken over that building.

508
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,000
What are you going to do?

509
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,600
I am going to wait until Bauer gets here.

510
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,000
Baker and his team are running
operations from behind the building.

511
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:56,199
They will move when we tell them to.

512
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,299
LAPD set up a perimeter here,
here, here and here.

513
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,600
We got SWAT teams moving in
this way and from over here.

514
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,700
Snipers on the roof.

515
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Nobody goes until we give the word.
Understand?

516
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,200
What's the situation?

517
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600
We have taken over building on either side of him.

518
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:10,700
We got snipers on the roof, ready to go.

519
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,199
Phones?

520
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,600
We didn't jam the area.You said he'd know.

521
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,900
What about infrared?

522
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,300
We can't get through those walls, Jack.

523
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
He knows we are here.

524
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
What makes you say that?

525
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Because I would.

526
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
You think he's still in there?

527
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:33,600
Yeah.

528
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,200
Why wouldn't he try to escape?

529
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:35,899
I don't know

530
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,000
All right, on my signal move
your teams into position.

531
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:39,299
Minimum 3 men per exit.

532
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Remember, no one goes into the
builder till I give the order.

533
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:44,900
We have to assume Saunders
has taken defensive measures.

534
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:45,700
Everybody ready?

535
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:46,500
Let's go

536
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,700
All team move into first position.
This is a go.

537
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,700
Repeat, this is a go.

538
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
- positions all set
- Let's go

539
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Stephen Saunders

540
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
This is Jack Bauer.

541
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,700
You are completely surrounded.

542
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,700
The President is refusing to
capitulate to any further demands.

543
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,000
I need to remind you that we
still have your daughter.

544
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Stephen.

545
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,900
It's over.

546
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,700
The only way you are getting out of this thing alive is
coming through the front door with your hands on your head.

547
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,100
That's not exactly true, Jack.

548
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,700
Adam

549
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,800
Not now, Chloe. I am running
comm on the Saunders pickup.

550
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:04,699
I know what you are doing

551
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Robin, take over Adam's screen
for a minute. Come here.

552
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,400
Why? Chloe, this is really not a good time.

553
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,200
Tony, I need you to hear this.

554
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,800
What?

555
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,900
I have to report some bad news.

556
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,100
Field ops lost 2 satellite feeds
because Adam forgot to segregate the channels.

557
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,599
What are you talking about?

558
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,950
It's true. I checked your system.

559
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,300
I had to reinitiate everything.

560
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:25,650
You touched my system?

561
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,925
Tony, let's face it.

562
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:28,199
Adam shouldn't be here.

563
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,400
He's under duress because
his sister's going to die.

564
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,600
I did not forget to separate
those channels, Tony

565
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,899
Yes, you did.

566
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,499
All right, look,
we don't have time for this.

567
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,600
We have teams on the ground
that are depending on us.

568
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,200
Did you back up the satellite data?

569
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:40,800
Yes. I reprogrammed almost everything.

570
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:41,950
We lost about 30 seconds.

571
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,099
We didn't lose it, Chloe.

572
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I can prove it to you right now.

573
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,400
I thought that I ¡­

574
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,199
Chloe is right.

575
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I forgot to separate them.

576
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,200
All right, look.

577
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,900
You made a mistake.

578
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,700
But what I need to know is if can you get through
the rest of the day without making another one.

579
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,400
Adam?

580
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,800
I'm fine, Tony.

581
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,600
Ok

582
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,999
I want you to know that I don't
agree with Tony's decision.

583
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
But since you are going to stay, I am going to double
check your logs every 10 minutes in case you screw up again.

584
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,399
Jack, what do you want to do?

585
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
If he's not in there, we are wasting
a lot of time we don't have.

586
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,400
Just have the men maintain their position.

587
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,599
This is Bauer

588
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,100
Congratulations, Jack

589
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,900
You found me.

590
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
Stephen, it's over. Come on out.

591
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,100
It would suit me better if you
came in here and got me.

592
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,500
I'd hate to be in the crosshairs
of all those unstable CTU snipers.

593
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,900
Come out the front door with
your hands on your head.

594
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I assure you, you'll be fine.

595
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,500
11 more vials, millions dead.

596
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,600
That doesn't affect your nerves a little bit?

597
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,500
The President has made himself clear.

598
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,300
He's not following orders from you anymore.

599
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I work for him.

600
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,400
Well, if that's the case, you won't
mind if I take a few minutes to think things over.

601
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,600
While you are thinking things over, you might want
to take a second and think about your daughter.

602
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,200
Tony just confirmed that he's in the building.

603
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,900
All teams hold your position.

604
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:46,900
We got confirmation.

605
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,500
Is it done?

606
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,500
Yes

607
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,400
All right. Stay on the line.

608
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,100
Almeida.

609
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,700
Listen to me very carefully, Agent Almeida.

610
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,199
Who's this?

611
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,500
It's Stephen Saunders.

612
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,500
Before you make any tactical errors,
I'd like to give you an update on the situation.

613
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,500
I'm listening.

614
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,800
I need you to move to a private area
that has direct comm. with your teams on site here.

615
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,200
And why would I do that?

616
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Open a web socket to ip 257.211.16.5,
and you will find out.

617
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,800
That's ip 257.211.16.5

618
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,900
Just trust me.

619
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,100
Do it.

620
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,600
By the way, Tony. I'd like to offer you congratulations
on your wife eluding infection from the virus.

621
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,700
How do you know about my wife?

622
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,100
Get on that site.

623
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,999
I don't know exactly what
they are doing to her, Tony.

624
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But I did instruct them to leave her
barely functional so that we can return her to you.

625
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll kill you, son of a bitch

626
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,500
I will rip your dam throat out.

627
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,000
You hear me?

628
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,999
I am low on time, so I am sorry
if I brush past that remark.

629
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Because in 15 seconds, Michelle will
be dead if you don't do what I say.

630
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
There are 5 agents watching the
northeast exit of this building.

631
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:27,350
4 on the ground, a sniper on
the rooftop next door.

632
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,899
I am assuming they are operating
as a single unit.

633
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,600
I want you to give them a code 9,
send them to the front entrance.

634
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,800
Now.

635
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,950
Jack Bauer's running the operation.

636
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,300
I don't have the authority to do that.

637
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,400
No authority?

638
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,100
Really?

639
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,400
Kevin, is Michelle still conscious?

640
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,300
Yes

641
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,800
Take an eye out.

642
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,900
No, wait, stop

643
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,700
Kevin, hold for a second.

644
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,600
It's gonna take me some time.

645
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,100
You have 30 seconds.

646
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Gerry, we are talking about mass
hysteria spreading out all over the place.

647
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,700
Now, we are not in any position to mobilize¡­

648
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:23,399
It doesn't matter.

649
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Our position is to let the public
know what is going on.

650
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,199
This is Baker.

651
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,350
This is Tony Almeida.

652
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:39,500
Switch to channel 3

653
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,599
Go ahead

654
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
We need you to code 9 your team

655
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
I want you to use a controlled
channel in case Saunders is listening.

656
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:48,299
What are we doing?

657
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Move everyone to the front now.

658
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
I have been monitoring all channels.

659
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:52,599
There's nothing going on in front.

660
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,500
We just got a new SAT feed that
Jack doesn't have yet.

661
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,900
Looks like Saunders is on the move in a blind spot.

662
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:57,899
Get there now.

663
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,100
Roger that. 4 CTU personnel
diverting to new mark.

664
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,499
No, Baker. Negative.

665
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,100
No, not just CTU personnel, everyone.

666
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:04,700
Police control included. Get there now.

667
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,100
Unit 4, we have a code 9.Repeat, code 9

668
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:08,799
Everyone to the front of the building now.

669
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,500
Get in your car, move to
the front of the building

670
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,900
Down, down



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

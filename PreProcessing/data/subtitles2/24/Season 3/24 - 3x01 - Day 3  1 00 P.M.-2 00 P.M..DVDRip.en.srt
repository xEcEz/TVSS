1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,510
Mr President?

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,513
We need medical assistance! Help!

3
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,757
This is security. l need help at the ramp.

4
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,831
Clear, sir.

5
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,638
Clear.

6
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,232
Step over there, please.
Give ´em lD.

7
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,231
There you go.

8
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,071
Open one.

9
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,237
You OK, Jack?

10
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,959
l won´t be OK until we get this thing signed.

11
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,508
That´s not what l meant.

12
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,112
OK. We´re all here.

13
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,670
- What kind of changes are we talking about?
- They´re not deal breakers.

14
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,149
He´s still gonna give up the terrorist cells.

15
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,949
He just wants to go to a class 2 detention.
Not maximum security.

16
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,553
- You´re giving him it?
- Yeah.

17
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,438
My client´s not happy that
you won´t hold him in Florida.

18
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,796
- He´s getting Minnesota.
- Give him Florida. There´s no difference.

19
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,189
l let you do yourjobs.
Why don´t you let me do mine?

20
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,078
We don´t want this thing
going south over some detail.

21
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,756
Salazar is unstable. We can´t predict what´ll
push his buttons. There´s too much at stake.

22
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,355
l know you two spent the last year
getting Salazar and l respect that.

23
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,117
- But there´s a protocol that l have to follow...
- Luis, come here for a second.

24
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,471
Putting him away is not the point. lf he
doesn´t talk, we´ve accomplished nothing.

25
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,791
l didn´t lose a year of my life
to arrest some drug dealer.

26
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,396
Salazar deals with terrorist cells around the
world. Bringing them down is our objective.

27
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,837
l understand. But if you give Salazar
everything he asks for, he´s gonna want more.

28
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,310
This is the deal. And he´s going to take it.

29
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,632
Here.

30
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,476
You better be right.

31
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,476
Douglas. ls that my life
you´re holding in your hand?

32
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,869
lt´s ready to be signed.

33
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,356
Are you in there, Jack?

34
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,079
(Douglas) Forget about Bauer.

35
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,833
How can l forget about
the man who put me here?

36
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,639
Pretended to be my friend.

37
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,598
l´m concerned about you, Jack.

38
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,629
The things you did to get me here,
l wouldn´t wish on anyone.

39
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,109
Let´s face it, you´ll never be the same.

40
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,239
Hey. Neither will l.

41
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,832
So l guess we are in the same boat.

42
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,915
l´m about to name names, Jack.
This is a big moment for both of us.

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,831
That makes me happy.

44
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,437
Because, you see, we are connected now.

45
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,269
l don´t know. Maybe we always have been.

46
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,477
l marked the changes.

47
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,632
l don´t need to see the changes.
But l do need the pen.

48
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,554
Unless you want me
to sign it with my own blood.

49
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,473
That´s kind of funny - ´´my own blood´´.

50
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,077
Where do l sign this, Douglas?

51
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,673
Right here.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,515
You have done a good job as my counsel.

53
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,993
Been a go-to guy, as they like to say here
in the States. But l think they´re on to you.

54
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,914
And l don´t think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,753
(Douglas) What do you mean?

56
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,592
Son of a bitch.

57
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,874
Open the door. Open the door!

58
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Do it now!

59
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,793
- Get a medic in here. Now!
- This is your fault, Jack.

60
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,317
- And what happens next is on you, too.
- What does that mean, huh? ls that a threat?

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,072
- Chase!
- Son of a bitch.

62
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,594
- Back off!
- Take a walk!

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,629
Did you hear me?

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,711
Did you hear me?

65
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,028
What happens next is on you, Jack.

66
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,031
lt´s on you!

67
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,359
- Dr Macer. We isolated the body.
- You said my name was on it?

68
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,954
Yes. lt´s on his chest.

69
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,150
Run a full panel of tests to be sure, but l think
we´re dealing with a pneumonic virus, type lll.

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,313
Type lll? lsn´t that the virus group
your team´s been doing simulations on?

71
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,470
l think that´s why this was addressed to me.

72
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,597
- Has CTU been contacted yet?
- No. We´ve been waiting for you.

73
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,389
Go ahead and start the pulmonary tests.
l´ll call Director Almeida.

74
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,430
Hey. The President arrive at SC yet?

75
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,910
Just about. We´re swapping our people
now Secret Service is in place.

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,150
They´re waiting for
your resource assessment.

77
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,549
All right, l´ll call ´em.

78
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,757
- l´ve had it, Tony, l swear to God.
- What´s the problem, Adam?

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,035
Chloe O´Brian does not touch my data.

80
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,669
lf Field Ops wants something, she asks Jack
or talks to you, then you tell me.

81
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,275
- Did she damage anything?
- That´s not the point.

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,875
My department has zero downtime
because of the procedures l put in place.

83
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,633
- Did she damage anything? Then let it go.
- No...

84
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,113
Jack´s got his department and l got mine. But
we´re all under the same roof, understood?

85
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,070
Good. Now, lighten up. You´re gonna
drive yourself and the rest of us crazy.

86
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,759
All right. Hold on.

87
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,153
Sunny Macer from Health Services
is on the line.

88
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,153
- By the way, have you heard from Hertzog?
- No, not yet.

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,557
- Relax, Michelle, you´re gonna get the job.
- You´re not going to Langley without me.

90
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,710
Hey. What´s up?

91
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,509
- This is one l´m sorry to be right about.
- What are you talking about?

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,068
Cordilla virus.
lt´s a type lll pneumonic virus.

93
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,755
Remember l raised the possibility
a strain could be out there?

94
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,068
- Yeah.
- lt is.

95
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,993
Someone just dropped off a dead body
infected with the virus.

96
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,551
These guys are serious. They blew up the
door to get our attention. This is a message.

97
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,076
That somebody´s got the virus
and they´re willing to release it?

98
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,878
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,110
Do we need to issue a quarantine advisory?

100
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,873
No. Once the host is dead it´s not contagious.

101
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,354
Call the other county facilities,
see if there are any more cases.

102
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,274
- What about the lD on the John Doe?
- Send everything over. We´ll work it up.

103
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,909
- lt´s on its way.
- All right. Thanks, Sunny.

104
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,956
What is it?

105
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,077
lnitiate a level one setting protocol.

106
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,476
(Salazar) And l don´t think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

107
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,710
(Douglas) What do you mean?

108
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,873
Salazar could have killed Shaye any time
over the last three months. Why today?

109
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,794
- He was cutting his deal.
- Maybe, but l don´t think so.

110
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,635
This is your fault, Jack.
And what happens next is on you, too.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,514
´´What happens next.´´

112
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,799
- CTU.
- This is Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida.

113
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,074
Hold on.

114
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,230
- (Tony) Hey.
- ls anything going on there?

115
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,313
We just had a major protocol come in.
Possible biothreat to the city.

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,753
Tell me about it.

117
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,674
A dead body infected with the Cordilla virus
was left at Health Services.

118
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,357
We figure it´s the first shoe dropping. We´re
waiting for somebody to take responsibility.

119
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,078
- Jack?
- Yeah.

120
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,958
You thinking this is connected to Salazar?

121
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,112
l don´t know. l don´t know, maybe.

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,794
- l´ll get back to you.
- All right.

123
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,790
- l need copies of all four images.
- Right away.

124
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,435
(cheering)

125
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,513
- Mr President.
- Wayne. Are we ready for the run-through?

126
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,912
Almost. The advance team dropped a ball
so we can´t get in there for a few minutes.

127
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,312
- That´s fine.
- No, it´s not fine. l fired Judy. lt was her fault.

128
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,914
She´s done some good work for us,
hasn´t she?

129
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,348
Tonight´s debate is critical. She should have
had every single base covered but she didn´t.

130
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,911
Mr President. How do you feel about
the debate with Senator Keeler?

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,319
Confident. Ready to go.

132
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,631
Sir, this is your first time back to LA
since the attempt on your life.

133
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,632
- Were you uneasy about coming back?
- Not at all.

134
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,555
Los Angeles is a great city. Would´ve been
back here sooner if events had allowed it.

135
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,350
What is important is that we´re here now,
looking to the future.

136
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,639
Thank you. That´s all for now. We´ll have a
formal Q&A this afternoon. You´ll be briefed.

137
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,794
David, we gotta talk about those GAO
members. Keeler´s gonna bring it up tonight...

138
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,236
David? David, are you all right?

139
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,639
l´m fine.

140
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,549
- Let me call one of the resident doctors.
- No, it´s all right. l´ll wait for Anne.

141
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,314
- Where you going, Jack? We have to talk.
- Not now.

142
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,233
- Then when?
- Call me. Right now we gotta get to CTU.

143
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,435
Why?

144
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,718
Salazar killed Shaye for a reason. He picked
today to do it. We gotta find out why.

145
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,678
Fine. Let´s go back in there
and put the screws on Salazar.

146
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,799
You think he´s gonna talk to us after
what we just watched him do? Not a chance.

147
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,711
Come on. Let´s go.

148
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,238
Jack.

149
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,788
Just call me.

150
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,397
All right, so what else did Almeida say
about this dead body?

151
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,078
- Jack.
- What?

152
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,799
l asked you about Tony.
What else did he say?

153
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,556
He said the body was dumped
at Health Services. They´re trying to lD it.

154
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,315
You know, you never answered me before.
About how you´re doing.

155
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,039
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

156
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,951
(phone rings)

157
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,037
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it´s Chloe.

158
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,634
l have Kate Warner for you.
Should l put her through?

159
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,233
Uh...

160
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,834
Yeah. Put her through.

161
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,319
- Jack?
- Hi, Kate.

162
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,155
l just wanted to let you know l found
that leatherjacket you thought you´d lost.

163
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,719
Oh. Uh...

164
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,156
- OK. Great.
- So, uh, what do you want to do?

165
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,595
l could bring it over. Or send it.

166
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,195
You don´t have to do that.
l´ll just send someone over to pick it up.

167
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,838
- You sure?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,070
- OK, then.
- Kate. How are you?

169
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,676
You know, it´s hard.

170
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,431
l miss you.

171
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,511
l´m really, really sorry.

172
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,718
Don´t be.

173
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,678
- Take care of yourself, Kate.
- Bye.

174
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,709
- How´s Kate?
- She´s all right.

175
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,594
- So you guys are still talking?
- No, not really.

176
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,319
All right. None of my business. Sorry.

177
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,157
l didn´t mean it like that. She´s just trying
to return a couple of things of mine, that´s all.

178
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,270
Got any water?

179
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,152
Talk to Sunny. She was checking with
the other facilities for any more cases.

180
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,196
lf there are, find out where.

181
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,716
Take all the regional cells
that have bioterrorist capabilities

182
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,836
and put ´em in a high-speed cache.

183
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,478
- OK.
- (phone rings)

184
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,711
Tony, it´s Larry Hertzog from Langley
on line two.

185
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,593
Hey, Larry.

186
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,235
Yeah, we are.

187
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,672
Uh-huh.

188
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,112
Uh-huh.

189
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,634
Yeah, l will. Thanks.

190
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,312
- Was that about me?
- Yeah.

191
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,633
He doesn´t have ajob for you right now.
There´s no new funding till after the election.

192
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,631
l see.

193
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,231
Also, Larry told me that he needs
an answer from me by the end of the day.

194
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,749
They´re in a hurry to fill the post.

195
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,598
We both know you can´t pass this up.
lt´s a major career move.

196
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,835
Call him and tell him it´s yes.

197
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,154
And you´ll come along as the wife?
Without ajob?

198
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,470
l´ll go anywhere with you.

199
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,189
As long as l don´t have to cook.

200
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,389
Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook,
l will take you with me anywhere.

201
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,234
But if they don´t have ajob for you,
l´m not interested.

202
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,548
(phone rings)

203
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,359
Tony. Homeland Security on line one.

204
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,749
We´ll talk about it later.

205
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,635
Almeida.

206
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,510
Pretty much. Just have to refresh
the data on my panel. Thanks.

207
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,272
- Hey, Kim.
- Yes, Michelle?

208
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,750
- You ever done a capability search?
- Couple of weeks ago, for Tony.

209
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,717
- The East European cells?
- Yes.

210
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,634
Good. This one´s different.
lt´s gonna be global.

211
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,955
- Here´s my access code.
- l´ll get right on it.

212
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,553
Thanks.

213
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,196
Hey, Adam.
Does the link file have DES encryptions?

214
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,874
No, it´s two key.

215
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,873
- What volume is the filter on?
- Étude seven.

216
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,520
- Thank you.
- You´re welcome.

217
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,238
Are you saying you had to break me?

218
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,717
No, mi ángel.

219
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,030
lt was you who break me.

220
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,710
(phone rings)

221
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,037
? Qué más?

222
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,679
? Seguro?

223
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,711
Sí, señor.

224
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,630
OK, it´s coming up now.

225
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,756
Thanks, Chris.

226
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,877
- Adam, l´m piping this over to your system.
- What is it?

227
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,829
Frags on the body that was dropped off at
Health Services. We´re doing an lD analysis.

228
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,799
- Where are you in the capability search?
- lt´s gonna be another 15 minutes.

229
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,757
- So you´re open?
- What do you need?

230
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,752
Adam´ll break off part of an lD.
We need a name. Give her the file.

231
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,115
- l don´t need her help.
- Yes, you do.

232
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,191
This is urgent.

233
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,514
l´m ready, Adam. Send the file.

234
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,752
- l´m open, Adam. Send me the file.
- No.

235
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,150
- Michelle told you...
- l don´t need anyone doing my work for me.

236
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,028
- What is your problem?
- Everyone in this place earned theirjob.

237
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,634
You got it cos of your dad.

238
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,718
What the hell is this?

239
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,277
(dials phone)

240
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,590
- Tracy, is your system locked?
- No.

241
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,591
OK, thanks.

242
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,468
lt could be you forgot
to set the group permission.

243
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,472
Someone who knows
the tree structure changed the ownership.

244
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,554
That wouldn´t be me because l´m incompetent
and only got this job because of my dad.

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,312
- Change the ownership back, Kim.
- Send the data fork.

246
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,470
lt´s your ass. Michelle´s waiting.

247
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,708
Fine. l´ll send it. Just unlock my system.

248
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,711
No problem.

249
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,028
- Hey, Jack, l´ll be up in a minute.
- OK.

250
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,715
Chloe. Give me what you got.

251
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,758
Are we in sync with the systems?

252
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,274
Everything Health Services sent
is in volume one.

253
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,956
- l´ve reprised all the Salazar information.
- Where are the date keys?

254
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,031
- l couldn´t get those for you.
- Why not?

255
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,590
You´ll have to talk to Tony, so he can tell
Adam and Adam can give them to me.

256
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,549
- You´re kidding me, right?
- No. Adam´s anal and he hates women.

257
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,991
Chloe.

258
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,913
Just get it for me, OK, please?

259
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,592
Close my door.

260
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,471
(grunts)

261
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,356
(phone rings)

262
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,318
- Yeah?
- lt´s Michelle.

263
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,029
The teleconference with Health Services
is about to start. Come down.

264
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,475
No, l´m gonna stay up here.
Patch them through.

265
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,198
- OK.
- Thanks.

266
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,429
You scared me.

267
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,514
- What are you doing in here?
- l am refreshing a drive.

268
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,836
What´s going on with Salazar?
Were you there when it happened?

269
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,433
Yeah.

270
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,511
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

271
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,430
How´s my dad taking it?

272
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,476
- He´s OK.
- Good.

273
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,075
l was thinking about talking to him today.

274
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,559
Uh-huh.

275
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,997
- Today might not be the best day.
- Chase, no day is a good day.

276
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,915
We said that we would tell him if we were still
together after two months. lt´s almost three.

277
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,515
Why don´t we just tell him
and get it over with?

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,797
All right.

279
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,597
But l´ll do it. OK?

280
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,874
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l´m sure.

281
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,632
- Really?
- Really.

282
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,110
You can´t put the drives there.
What l need you to do is look under...

283
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,794
- F6, right?
- Yeah. OK, thanks.

284
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,871
We received results of more tests.

285
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,191
The news isn´t good.
This is a weaponised strain.

286
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,669
lt has been engineered to kill more rapidly.

287
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,591
How rapidly?

288
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,913
lt´s a bit of a guess but, based on the autopsy,
if infection starts at Tequals zero hours,

289
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,958
there´s a noncontagious latency period
of 14 hours.

290
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,229
After 14 it presents. After 20 the host
is incapacitated. By 24 the host is dead.

291
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,070
What are the epidemiological consequences?

292
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,674
if the virus initiates at a single location,

293
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,320
there will be a couple hundred cases
by the end of day one.

294
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,868
By the end of day two
it could be in the thousands,

295
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,669
but from there it´s easier to talk about
in percentage of population.

296
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,038
By the end of the first week, nine per cent
of Los Angeles county will be infected.

297
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,715
Nine per cent?
That´s over a million people.

298
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,430
And those people will die
within 24 hours of infection.

299
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,640
So tell me, if someone were gonna try to
release this virus into the general population,

300
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,438
how would they do it?

301
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,308
That´s the million-dollar question.
lt could come from anywhere.

302
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,915
We don´t know who has it.
We don´t know where they plan to release it.

303
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,594
We don´t even know what form it´s in.

304
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,955
(£ ´´Horse Drawn´´ by Memory Bank)

305
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,275
- (knock at door)
- (woman) Kyle?

306
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,111
What, Ma?

307
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,953
- Tim wants you to know he´s at the pool.
- Thanks, Ma.

308
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,635
Can you take me to the doctor
later on this afternoon?

309
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,838
- What´s Dad doing?
- On ajob interview. Fingers crossed.

310
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,434
Fingers crossed.

311
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,949
Can Aunt Norma take you?

312
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,713
Why? What´s so important
that you can´t take me?

313
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,835
l mean...

314
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,311
lt´s just l got a bunch of stuff
to do today, Ma. l´m sorry.

315
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,718
- Fine. l´ll call Norma.
- Thanks.

316
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,596
Love you, Ma.

317
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,470
Mr President. The country was in shock
after the attempt on your life.

318
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,597
But its prayers were answered
when you survived.

319
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,231
That said, many Americans have expressed
concern that you are not fully recovered,

320
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,993
and are not strong enough
to serve for four more years.

321
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,117
How would you respond
to those who make such claims?

322
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,919
l wake up every morning at 5am.

323
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,150
l spend the first hour in the weight room.

324
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,993
While l´m exercising,
l´m prepping for my meetings.

325
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,390
- And then l put in a 16-hour day...
- Hold on!

326
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,475
Could we pause the video, please?
Get ready to play it back.

327
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,509
Sorry, Chuck. Hold on. Don´t dignify
that question with a defensive response.

328
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,350
l didn´t realise that stating
the facts was being defensive.

329
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,150
They bring up the assassination attempt, fine.
You remind them it was your administration

330
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,674
that arrested the man
behind the attempt on your life

331
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,355
and exposed his organisation
and put his top-tier people away.

332
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,671
All this while you were in
this so-called ´´weakened state´´.

333
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,551
Keeler would be lucky to have a fraction
of your energy. That´s what you tell ´em.

334
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,915
Mr President. Go ahead, Chuck.

335
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,798
And Mom called him the timid brother.

336
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,908
Ah, there´s my doctor. How are you?

337
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,037
- Mr President.
- (Wayne) All right. Let´s break for a minute.

338
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,076
l´m fine. How´s he been?

339
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,631
- Seems a little tired.
- l am not tired. l´m just a little jet-lagged.

340
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,472
How´s this going?

341
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,438
l´m definitely winning the run-through.

342
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,519
(phone rings)

343
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,758
- 130 over 80.
- Good. This is Wayne Palmer.

344
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,400
- How tired?
- l´m fine.

345
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,235
- We haven´t done a workup in a while...
- No. No, no, no. No tests.

346
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,949
You start looking for something
and you don´t stop until you find it.

347
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,110
l´m fine, Anne.

348
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,599
OK.

349
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,879
But when you get back to DC, l want you to
have a complete physical. Doctor´s orders.

350
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,951
Yes, ma´am.

351
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,430
Anne. l need him alone for a minute.

352
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,512
- He´s all yours.
- What is it?

353
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,672
l just received a disturbing call
from Health Services.

354
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,392
They found a body in Los Angeles that´s been
infected with a contagious and deadly virus.

355
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,199
There´s concerns
it´s notjust a random occurrence.

356
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,192
- Meaning what?
- CTU is looking to the possibility

357
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,510
that this could be a criminal action.

358
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,353
Criminal action? Based on this one death?

359
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,317
l don´t know the details,

360
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,712
but it has to do with the circumstances
under which the body was found.

361
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,678
- Keep your eye on this one.
- OK.

362
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,231
Chuck, can we go down to question seven,
about homeland security?

363
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,590
- Chloe.
- Yes?

364
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,832
- Where are the transcripts of Salazar?
- l sent them to your system, in your directory.

365
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,435
Dammit, l wanted it stored
with the rest of the files from Salazar.

366
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,875
OK. l´ll do it.

367
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,396
Chloe, if you can´t get things right
the first time, l can get someone who can.

368
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,472
lf you wanted it with the other files
you should have said so.

369
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,479
- That isn´t standard, so l wouldn´t do it.
- Do it that way from now on, OK?

370
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,314
l can´t read minds. You´ll just
have to spell it out for me, otherwise...

371
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,238
Dammit, Chloe! Just do it now!

372
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,550
Fine.

373
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,988
Hey, Jack.

374
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,593
What?

375
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,355
- What was that all about?
- l need you to replace Chloe for me.

376
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,193
Replace her? She´s the best analyst we got.

377
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,236
- She´s not. She´s slow.
- She´s not slow.

378
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,596
She may be a little weird
but she knows her stuff.

379
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,710
You look like hell.

380
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,156
What did you just say to me?

381
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,792
We´re on an active protocol, OK?
l need to know if you´re up for it or not.

382
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,669
l like working with you, Chase.
You´re a nice kid.

383
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,392
But don´t you ever come into my office
and talk to me like that again. Understand?

384
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,710
l´m just saying you´re on edge. OK?

385
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,191
l mean, come on, man,
you´re about to fire Chloe for no reason.

386
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,629
- Chloe.
- Yes?

387
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,759
l´m sorry l took your head off.
We´re just having a bad morning, OK?

388
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,274
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

389
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,073
You´re happy?

390
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,871
Look, Jack. There´s one more thing
l gotta talk to you about.

391
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,871
(phone rings)

392
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,430
- This is Bauer.
- (Tony) We´ve got something new on Salazar.

393
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,556
OK, we´ll be right down.

394
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,518
They got something on Salazar.

395
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,238
What do you wanna tell me?

396
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,993
Nothing. lt´ll hold.

397
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,832
Good.

398
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,878
ln order to plug any possible security
breaches, we´ll do date checks from now on.

399
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,349
Break your logs into eight-hour intervals.

400
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,672
Put different encryptions on each interval. lf
one is breached, one won´t bleed to the other.

401
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,470
- Did you tell him?
- No. There´s a lot going on. lt´ll happen.

402
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,231
An anonymous call came in to the FBl ten
minutes ago. They´re gonna stream it to us.

403
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,834
- Did you hear it?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,798
- OK. lt´s ready.
- Bring it up.

405
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,079
(distorted) You´ve received our package
and realised we´re in possession of a type lll

406
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,754
pulmonary immuno virus.

407
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,400
Listen very carefully to these instructions.

408
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,869
Our demand is very simple.

409
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,478
We want the release
of Ramón Salazar in the next six hours.

410
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,237
if you refuse to comply, the virus
will be unleashed to the general population.

411
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,791
As your experts will tell you,
you will not have time to stop its spread.

412
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,111
Details of how Ramón
is to be delivered will follow.

413
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
- That´s it.
- Do we know where the call originated?

414
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,594
lt came out of a scrambled satellite signal.
We´re trying to narrow it down.

415
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,434
You know Salazar better than anybody else
here. Who are we dealing with?

416
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,034
His brother. Hector was next in command.

417
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,918
He went underground
when Ramón was taken into custody.

418
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,312
Look. l know that the Salazars own multiple
properties in South America and Mexico,

419
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,311
registered under dummy corporations.

420
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,109
Unfortunately, the Mexican government
is saying they can´t locate them.

421
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,193
We´re gonna have to throw out a pretty large
net to trace the origin of that call.

422
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,999
- We´ll work on it.
- How are we doing with the lD on the body?

423
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,356
- Michelle´s running the DNA.
- What about prints and dental?

424
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,195
- No teeth, no fingertips.
- We need this lD. lt´s the only hook we´ve got.

425
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,032
What about questioning Salazar?

426
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,556
Complete waste of time.
This is a man without vulnerability.

427
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,077
He doesn´t respond to interrogation or care
about a living soul, including his children.

428
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,515
Tony! We´ve a match on John Doe.

429
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,958
- Show us what you got.
- The dead body is a David Goss.

430
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,952
He´s a street dealer in East LA,
also an informant.

431
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,271
He flipped sides so many times
DEA stopped working with him.

432
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,316
- Last known address?
- We´re working on it.

433
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,076
We need to know who infected Goss. Work up
a list of people involved in his life this week.

434
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,596
- We´ll pull together everything we can.
- Work it from the other side too.

435
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,036
Go through Salazar´s network.
Find the supplier who sold to Goss.

436
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,398
Good work. Chase, come with me.
Let´s see if anything´s come in on Hector.

437
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,470
Entonces, asegúrate. Que no se note nada.

438
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,869
Sí, señor.

439
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,554
Ponle el petrol. Ponle fuego.

440
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,870
Sigue, ponle el petrol.

441
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,838
Why do you have my father
doing this kind of work for you?

442
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,753
lt´s not his job.

443
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,910
lt is today.

444
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,429
Why did you kill Shaye?

445
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,152
Take a look around. You´re in a US prison
where your ass will rot until you´re executed.

446
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,631
You want to improve your conditions here,
you better start talking to me.

447
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,872
- What do you want to talk about?
- Why did you kill your attorney?

448
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,872
- l didn´t want him talking to you.
- About what?

449
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,712
About anything.

450
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,473
lt´s eating at you, isn´t it?

451
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,077
What am l up to? Come on, Luis.

452
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,438
You have me in chains. Two tough guys
waiting for a chance to beat me to a pulp.

453
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,511
Do it, Luis!

454
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,319
See if you can beat it out of me.

455
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,076
You are no fun.

456
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,557
Where are you going?

457
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,232
Claudia.

458
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,314
Claudia.

459
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,879
Claudia!

460
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,597
What´s wrong?

461
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,513
My father is the ranch foreman.

462
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,592
You promised he wouldn´t be involved
in your other activities.

463
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,638
l pay him three times over.
He can perform an extra task or two.

464
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,598
No, no, no. No.
l told you when we came to live here

465
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,038
that l didn´t want him or my little brother
to be exposed to your illegal business.

466
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,637
You broke your word, Hector.

467
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,595
And that hurts me.

468
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,159
lt hurts.

469
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,272
l´m sorry, Claudia.

470
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,511
- Please, l make it up to you.
- How?

471
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,229
l give your father some time off.
An extra month´s pay.

472
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,310
That´s your solution
to every problem, isn´t it?

473
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,992
Money.

474
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,914
Claudia.

475
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,918
Claudia.

476
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,671
Claudia!

477
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,150
(phone rings)

478
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,594
- Yeah?
- Have you made the call to the FBl?

479
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,591
Yes, l did.

480
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,432
- What about our boy?
- l´m watching him now.

481
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,988
- Keep him close.
- l will.

482
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,870
So what was it like to get knee-deep
in some fine Tijuana dell?

483
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,429
Huh?

484
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,511
- l didn´t do that.
- What do you mean?

485
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,910
l mean l didn´t go down there to get laid.

486
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,390
- But you said...
- No, l know. l know what l said.

487
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,271
l just didn´t wanna tell you
in case something happened.

488
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,870
So, what´s the big secret?

489
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,628
Remember Zach Parker from high school?

490
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,359
Sure. Didn´t he get busted last year
for dealing coke?

491
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,668
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,069
Whatever. He set me up
with this guy down there.

493
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,392
- ´´Set you up´´? How do you even know him?
- l know him, OK?

494
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,552
What are you into here, man?
Are you selling dope?

495
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,198
No.

496
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,559
- l´m not exactly selling anything...
- Then exactly what are you doing?

497
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,951
This guy... he paid me five grand
to bring some coke over the border.

498
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,874
l did that last night.
Today l drop it off, l get another five.

499
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,269
- You´re outta your mind.
- lt´s just one time.

500
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,670
Getting over the border´s the hard part.
That´s already done.

501
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,876
Why are you doing this?

502
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,590
Cos my mom´s on dialysis.
My dad´s out of ajob.

503
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,356
We´re about to get evicted from this crappy
apartment. ls that good enough for you?

504
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,557
Dude, you are seriously insane.

505
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,471
Look, Tim.

506
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,918
l´m about to make this drop later today.
l was thinking, maybe we could go together.

507
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,070
- Forget it!
- You just wait in the car.

508
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,517
l go in, l make the drop, l come back out.
That´s it. There´s no big deal.

509
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,397
l´m not interested.

510
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,351
Think about it.

511
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,911
(girl squeals)

512
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,275
- Mr President, sir.
- Mr President, sir.

513
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,396
Carry on.

514
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,268
- When did FBl get this call?
- About 20 minutes ago.

515
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,194
- We don´t know who we´re dealing with?
- lt was a scrambled voice on an open line.

516
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,796
All we know is what he said. They want
Salazar or they´re gonna release the virus.

517
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,112
What´s your take on this, Wayne?
Do we cancel the debate?

518
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,352
So far, DOD, the Pentagon and CTU
haven´t recommended raising the alert level,

519
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,911
but they are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

520
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,797
- Sir.
- Yes, Aaron?

521
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,189
Dr Packard´s here. She´s asked to see you.

522
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,670
- Tell her l´m busy, please.
- Yes, Mr President.

523
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,796
Aaron, wait.

524
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,920
- Tell her l´ll speak with her.
- Yes, sir.

525
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,753
You really wanna do that right now?

526
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,593
Yes, Wayne, l do.

527
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,359
- Yes, Anne?
- l want you to start taking these.

528
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,513
One in the morning and one before
you go to bed. lt´ll help your energy.

529
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,195
- l told you l was fine.
- l know what you told me.

530
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,590
Are you gonna trust your doctor or not?

531
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,671
Course l am.

532
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,394
So, what´s going on? You seem upset.

533
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,710
Nothing.

534
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,156
lt´s just gonna be another one of those days.

535
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,232
What does that mean?

536
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,834
l´ve got to get back.

537
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,478
OK.

538
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,839
We´ll talk later.

539
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,113
- What is wrong with this system?
- What?

540
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,760
The grid won´t come up.

541
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,594
That´s because you need
to ´´control S´´ out of it.

542
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,558
You´re still in Navigation.

543
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,358
Thank you.

544
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,189
Look, can you just patch it
through to my office?

545
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,836
(coughs)

546
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,754
- What´s his problem today?
- Nothing.

547
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,313
This time line goes straight
from December to February.

548
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,234
- What are you trying to do, Jack?
- Same as you. Solve this problem.

549
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,471
That´s not what l´m talking about.

550
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,434
Listen, Jack.

551
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,034
l´m gonna be honest with you.

552
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,076
l look up to you.

553
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,314
l´d take a bullet for you if l had to,
but right now l´m gonna hold the mirror up.

554
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,477
You were under with Salazar for six months.

555
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,874
l know what they did to you.

556
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,679
And l know what you did to yourself.

557
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,679
You can´t make that go away overnight.

558
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,950
You think l didn´t know?

559
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,518
You should mind your own business, Chase.

560
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,068
All l´m trying to say
is that l´m here for you.

561
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,790
But today is not the day to try
to prove to everybody that you´re all better.

562
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,112
lt´s about to hit the fan.
You know that and l know that.

563
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,153
So do what you gotta do, man.

564
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,798
Get your head straight so we can do our work.

565
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,912
(phone rings)

566
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,355
Dad, you up there?

567
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,038
Dad?

568
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,319
Yeah.

569
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,119
Can l come up?
l need to talk to you about something.

570
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,519
Uh...

571
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,592
Not right now, sweetheart.
l´m in the middle of something.

572
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,717
OK. Call me when you have a few minutes.

573
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,233
OK.

574

1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,659
Previous on 24.

2
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:13,708
What's going on with Jack Bauer?

3
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,427
The operation wasn't completely successful.

4
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:19,006
They do have Saunders' daughter,
but they were unable to remain covert.

5
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:20,465
So, Saunders knows we have her?

6
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:23,995
No, not yet, but CTU is estimating
he will find out within the hour.

7
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:27,254
The deadline for his next demand is
gonna be up here in about 15 minutes.

8
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:31,451
Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll is an act of treason.

9
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:34,571
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.

10
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,760
We have run out of time.
We need you to call your father.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,909
And tell him what?

12
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,058
Anything. We just want you to keep him on the line.

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,917
- Jane?
- Hi, Dad.

14
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:45,986
What's wrong?

15
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:47,976
I told you only to use this number in an emergency.

16
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:49,525
Someone is monitoring the call.

17
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:51,804
They've got her.

18
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:54,284
There's a man named Jack Bauer with you,
isn't there?

19
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,093
Hand the phone to him.

20
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:00,701
You know how many vials I have,
and what I am capable of.

21
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:02,341
You know what I am capable of, too.

22
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,467
Stephen Saunders

23
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,527
This is Jack Bauer.

24
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:14,736
You are completely surrounded.

25
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:18,186
The President is refusing to
capitulate to any further demands.

26
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:21,129
The only way you are getting
out of this thing alive is

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,373
coming through the front door
with your hands on your head.

28
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:25,193
That's not exactly true, Jack.

29
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:30,541
I'd like to offer you congratulations on
your wife eluding infection from the virus.

30
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,700
How do you know about my wife?

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,529
I don't know exactly what
they are doing to her, Tony.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,188
But I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so that we can return her to you.

33
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,537
There are 5 agents watching the
northeast exit of this building.

34
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,306
Send them to the front entrance.

35
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,605
Michelle will be dead if you don't do what I say.

36
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:47,705
This is Tony Almeida.

37
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:48,844
What are we doing?

38
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:49,673
Move everyone to the front now.

39
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,753
Get in your car, move to the front of the building

40
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,033
Down, down

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,478
The following takes place
between 9:00 am and 10:00 am.

42
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,865
Stephen Saunders, this is your final warning.

43
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,294
Come out of the building now.

44
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:36,238
Smoke him out

45
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:38,437
Release the tear gas.

46
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:50,932
Send them in

47
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,972
Perimeter teams, move in. Move in

48
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,641
All right, boys, let's go, let's go

49
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,540
Move

50
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:05,247
Baker

51
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,236
Why aren't you covering the south perimeter?

52
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:12,885
CTU moved us off our position
They said you needed us out front.

53
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:14,204
What are you talking about? Why would they do that?

54
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,294
They said the SAT feed showed Saunders moving
toward a blind spot in front of the building.

55
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,570
All teams respond. I repeat, all teams respond.

56
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,549
Any sign of Saunders?

57
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,528
Jack, we are in.There's no sign of him yet.

58
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,288
Who gave you that order?

59
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:33,997
Tony

60
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,287
Move your team back to their marks now.Move

61
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,373
- CTU, Almeida
- Tony, it's Jack

62
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:47,923
Baker just told me you pulled
his team out of position.

63
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,652
Yeah. I was working off the information I had.

64
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,221
It was bad information.
You should have cleared it with me.

65
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,930
Somebody in my team made a mistake.
I am not going to get into it now.

66
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,519
Tony, that's an unacceptable mistake.

67
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,369
I have tactical command in the field.

68
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,148
If you can't run CTU, you'd better replace
yourself with someone who can.

69
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:10,355
- Chase, check in.
- Yeah, Jack

70
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:13,754
We covered the entire building, he is not here.

71
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:18,392
Dame it

72
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,411
Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building.

73
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,889
What do you mean, he's not in there?
He's got to be in there.

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,709
He's gone. What were you just telling Jack about
someone in your group making a mistake?

75
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,208
Never mind.

76
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,147
Adam, are we sure we tracked
Saunders to the right building?

77
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:35,196
Of course we did, Tony
He was in there when Jack made that phone call

78
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,185
I am pulling up imagery now to see what went wrong

79
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,445
I will take care of that.

80
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,064
You stay with Chloe, cover the site teams

81
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:25,098
Almeida.

82
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,627
I hope you covered your tracks and purged
the incriminating satellite frames.

83
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,007
I did what you wanted me to.Now where's my wife?

84
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,666
Not so fast.I like to do things in phases.

85
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,555
You should know that by now.That was phase one.

86
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,924
Next, we have to talk about my daughter.

87
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,693
What about her?

88
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:43,292
I want her back, of course.

89
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,402
Yeah, well, I want my wife back.

90
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,561
Then there should be no problem.

91
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:47,800
Where's Jane now?

92
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,970
She's on her way here. She should
be here in about 5 minutes.

93
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,129
Good. When she gets there, pick the men to guard her.

94
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,898
Make sure they will follow your orders without question.

95
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,526
If any harm comes to my daughter, your wife dies.

96
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,926
If Jane is not released when I order it,
your wife dies.

97
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,425
That's all you need to know. Are we clear?

98
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:05,704
Tony, are you in there?

99
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:08,843
Tony, President Palmer is on the line for you.

100
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:10,693
I will do my part. You do yours.

101
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,332
That's the spirit.

102
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,271
Tony, are you there?

103
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:16,080
Adam, I am here

104
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:17,090
Are you ok?

105
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,280
- Yeah, I am fine. Put the President through.
- Ok,hang on.

106
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,899
This is Tony Almeida.

107
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,148
Please hold for the President.

108
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:25,927
Mr. Almeida

109
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,217
I just heard you lost Stephen Saunders.
Is that true?

110
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:29,896
Yes, sir. Unfortunately, it is.

111
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,535
I thought CTU was certain of his location.
What happened?

112
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:34,964
We are looking into it now, sir.

113
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,703
Does Saunders know we are holding his daughter?

114
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:38,852
Yes, sir, he does.

115
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,102
And she's obviously very important to him.

116
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,351
Is Jane Saunders with you now?

117
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,340
No. She's on her way here right now, sir.

118
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:50,719
Mr. Almeida, I don't have to remind you how much
security we are going to need around her today.

119
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,967
She is the only thing that is standing between us
and Stephen Saunders controlling the government.

120
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:56,766
Yes, Mr. President.

121
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,146
- We're aware of that.
- Good

122
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:01,865
Keep me posted.

123
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,034
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,044
Thank you, sir.

125
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,368
Senator, Senator Keeler, do you feel this is
going to do serious damage to your campaign?

126
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:21,607
Oh, absolutely not.

127
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,915
My record on labor speaks for itself
Remeber I voted againt NAFTA

128
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,915
And I favor tax incentives for domestic manufacturing.

129
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,915
And what about the other endorsements you lost?

130
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,364
Who did he lose?

131
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,104
AFL CIO and a couple of veteran groups.

132
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,533
Why?

133
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:38,521
Apparently, they are not pleased with his
negative spin on your withdrawal from the debate

134
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,790
Now that the threat level has been raised to red,
peoplerealize you aren't the one playing politics. He is.

135
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,709
We can't waste time thinking
about the election right now.

136
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,019
The only thing that matters
is stopping Stephen Saunders.

137
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,037
Would you come with me, please.Excuse us, Jerry.

138
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,702
No, Adam, he was in the building.We found the room
he was using.I just want to know how he got out.

139
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:07,512
We are working on it, Chase.
I will call you if we get something.

140
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,091
Good

141
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:10,030
What did he say?

142
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,820
I don't understand this, Jack

143
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,285
We pinpointed Saunders' location.
He disappears into the air.

144
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,269
Now CTU says they are having
problems with the satellite.

145
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,058
We are looking into it.Baker, this is Jack.

146
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,237
I want 2 teams on patrol, 2 more on standby. Copy?

147
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:22,565
What about us?

148
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,986
We will go over to CTU. I want to be with Saunders'
daughter when he calls us back.

149
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:25,986
All right.

150
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,609
How did Saunders get past us?
We had every exit covered.

151
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,949
Did he have access to our tracking systems?

152
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,137
CTU, O'Brian

153
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:48,038
Chloe, it's Jack. What are you working on?

154
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:49,847
We are all trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.

155
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:53,026
I am analyzing his last phone call to you
to see if there's any tell on the carrier.

156
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,555
Is it possible that he wasn't even in the building?

157
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,054
That he was just routing his calls through there?

158
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,914
No. He did that earlier at the apartment.

159
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,093
Now that I have his counterfeit signature,
he wouldn't be able to do it without our knowing it.

160
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,912
Ok. Get back to me as soon as you have got anything.

161
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:07,381
Something is not right here

162
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,743
- This is CTU?
- Yes

163
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:31,612
Kim, your father wants you to know that
he and Chase are on their way back.

164
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,911
- With Saunders?
- No

165
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,361
Why not?

166
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,430
He wasn't in the building They a
re still trying to locate him

167
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,989
- They haven't captured my father?
- No.

168
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,749
But he knows you have me, right?

169
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,270
Yes, he does.

170
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,320
Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida

171
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,940
We are going to be putting
Miss Saunders in the holding room.

172
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,270
I was told you were setting up a white room for her.

173
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,410
Yeah. That's changed.

174
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,400
If you walk her to the back,
Security will take her from there.

175
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,010
You will be fine, ok?

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,850
How are you doing?

177
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,880
I can't believe that Saunders escaped.

178
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,970
I mean, how could this happen?
I thought that he was surrounded.

179
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,010
It happened. Look,
Rae Plachecki's coming here to talk to you.

180
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,750
You're going to have to answer some questions
about the shooting at the library.

181
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,350
Ok, look, I heard the news about Michelle.

182
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,210
- What news?
- That she isn't infected.

183
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,470
Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,900
I am really glad that she's ok. That's great.

185
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,970
Yeah, thanks

186
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,340
There is on way to be exactly sure.

187
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,690
Some people don't show symptoms for 5 or 6 hours.

188
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,430
- Adam
- Didn't they talk to you about your options?

189
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,310
They said they could give me a pill...

190
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,610
Adam, I need to talk to you now

191
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,340
Sarah, hold on.I am talking to my sister right now

192
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,680
The one who got infected with the virus?

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,770
I am not even going to answer that, Chloe.

194
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,920
I am sorry. I'll just wait here until you are done.

195
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,940
- Chloe.
- Adam, I am sorry, this is really important.

196
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,580
I just need you to finish up as quickly as you can.

197
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,200
Sarah, I am going to have to call
you back as soon as I can, ok?

198
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,790
Ok

199
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,130
- I love you
- I love you

200
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,390
- What?
- I checked with satellite navigation

201
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,780
They said there are missing frames and
they are certain it's on our end.

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
What about the back up on the FGA volume?

203
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,160
Gone. Not only that, they cover about 20 seconds.

204
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,990
So if Saunders did escape the building it
would be the exact interval

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,970
So there was a glitch at exactly the wrong moment?

206
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,700
Yeah. What are the chances of that?

207
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,900
Not good

208
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,810
So I am thinking Saunders has access to our system.

209
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,680
Did you tell Tony yet?

210
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,750
No. I want more information before I go to him.

211
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,330
But I checked with Field Ops,
and all their systems are accounted for.

212
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,400
I need you to do the same in Comm.

213
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,790
Do you really think there's someone
inside CTU working for Saunders?

214
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,820
That's the only thing that makes sense right now

215
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,730
So if you could just do that,
and then you could call your sister back.

216
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,150
- Hey, Pete, I need few minutes.- Sure thing

217
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,500
How you doing?

218
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,720
Why am I being treated like
I have done something wrong?

219
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,180
I apologize for that.

220
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,740
We are just trying to keep you safe.

221
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,980
This is the one place I am not safe.

222
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,760
I have been thinking about it.

223
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:00,060
You need me to get to my father, so threatening to killme
or harm me is the only tool you have to use against him

224
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,500
Tell me I am wrong.

225
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,500
You are right.

226
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,820
We need your father to believe we
will do anything to get him.

227
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,860
But we are not going to hurt you.

228
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,160
I give you my word

229
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,700
- Your word?
- Yeah,my word

230
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,590
I run this office and I will personally protect you.

231
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,660
What about Kim's father?
They told her that he is on his way back here.

232
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,650
- What about him?
- He scares me.

233
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,580
I got the feeling he's willing to hurt me.

234
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,010
Nobody's going to hurt you.

235
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:47,990
All right?

236
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,510
I wish I could believe you.

237
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,780
Almeida

238
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,300
- Has Jane arrived?
- Yeah

239
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,010
- Where is she?
- She is here

240
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,640
- Put her on.
- No

241
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,420
You have my wife, I want to talk to her first

242
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,060
You don't give me orders.

243
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,110
You are wrong

244
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,410
I have your daughter which means I am in charge.

245
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,620
Now if you so much as touch my wife,
I will slit Jane's throat.

246
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,550
Hold on

247
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,480
Sorry for your discomfort

248
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,360
Hopefully it's temporary.Uncuff her

249
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
I am going to let you speak to your husband

250
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,850
Tell him that you are ok and
you are being treated well.

251
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,540
Nothing else.Understood?

252
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,180
Tony, it's me

253
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,460
Michelle

254
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,750
They won't let me say much

255
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,940
Are you all right?

256
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,300
I am fine.I am being treated well

257
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,490
Don't let them do this, don't let¡­

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,370
- None of that.
- Michelle

259
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,140
Let me speak with my daughter, Mr. Almeida

260
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,790
It's your father.He wants to talk to you

261
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,190
- Dad?
- Yes, Jane. It's me.

262
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,760
They are saying horrible things about you.

263
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,630
That's what they do.Don't believe any of it

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,530
The virus in the hotel,it's killing
all of those people, you didn't do that.

265
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,110
Please tell me that you didn't do that.

266
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,520
Listen to me, Jane.

267
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,140
The US government distorts the
truth and destroys lives.

268
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,230
Don't listen to any of it.It's all lies.

269
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,130
Then you didn't do it?

270
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,380
I'd never do something without good cause.
You know that.

271
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,540
That's all.

272
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,740
Let's do these.

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,780
What will it take for you to
get her out of the building?

274
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,760
I have to fabricate some clearances.
It's going to take me about 30 to 40 minutes

275
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,620
Contact me as soon as you are clear of CTU.

276
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,300
Take down this number.

277
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,200
You were right. Someone from Tony's group
purged the frames from the surveillance feed.

278
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,530
Do you know who?

279
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,870
It was a no name login.
It could have been from here or Division.

280
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,300
I'd better tell Tony so he can lock down the system.

281
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
Ok

282
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,680
CTU, O'Brian

283
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,370
This is Sunny Macer from Health Services.

284
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,490
Sunny, what can I do for you?

285
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,130
Have you heard from Michelle Dessler
in the last half hour?

286
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,780
No, she was sent to your office for observation.

287
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,450
Well, that's actually why I am calling.

288
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,780
I got a message that she asked to be taken to County
instead,but she's not at County and she's definitely not here.

289
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,190
We can't get ahold of her.

290
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,130
I will check on it and get back to you.

291
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,060
All right, thanks

292
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,930
Davis, get me Mike Redmond.
He's with Michelle Dessler.

293
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,030
All right.

294
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,060
He's not answering

295
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,900
What do you mean he's not answering?

296
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,400
He's active. He has to answer.

297
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,340
He's not answering.

298
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,160
Ok, I heard you the first time.

299
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,640
Are you sure about this?

300
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,450
Yes, Tony, of course I am sure

301
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,660
There's 79 users in your group, and one of them
has been playing games with the uplink recording

302
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,690
All right, well

303
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,120
We are going to have to lock everything down then

304
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,350
Well, obviously I agree.

305
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,200
You want me to do it now?

306
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,610
Yeah

307
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,770
What is it?

308
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,180
Something weird is happening with Michelle.

309
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,620
What do you mean?

310
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,310
No one can find her, and Redmond's
not answering his pages.

311
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,800
That's because I overrode NHS's order.

312
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,610
I didn't want them to know about it.

313
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,330
I am putting Michelle in quarantine in one of
our substations so she can still do some work

314
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,320
I need every warm body I can get.

315
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,210
What am I going to tell Macer?

316
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:56,840
I will call her.

317
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,430
There's something else I want you to do.

318
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,130
What is it?

319
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,630
I am sending you the record of a phone call
between Saunders and myself from a few minutes ago.

320
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,530
You just spoke to him?

321
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,950
Yeah. I want you to strip away the carrier signal,
see if you can use it to find him.

322
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,460
What about the voice track?

323
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,940
No, he scrambled it. It's useless.

324
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,490
Fine

325
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,470
Chloe

326
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,020
Do it in tech one, away from everybody.

327
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,110
I didn't want Adam to know about it.

328
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,340
Why not?

329
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,080
Well, technically it's his job.

330
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,420
But you are better at it.

331
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,520
Why did you just say that?

332
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,340
Because it's true.

333
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,320
Damn it, Mark, you assured me that going on the
offensive against Palmer was the right thing to do

334
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,899
Now it's backfiring.

335
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,050
Come on, John.That's not fair

336
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,820
Palmer walks out of the debate moments after
you brought up the charge against his girlfriend

337
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,440
Everyone assumed that he whole
national security excuse was just a cover

338
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,250
Well, apparently it wasn't

339
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,540
The alert level is at red and the
airports are shut down

340
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,350
- I know.
- All right

341
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,800
Palmer still hasn't told the public
any of the details about this threat.

342
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,330
Call Alex in the Pentagon see
what you can find out about it.

343
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,830
Depending on what it turns out to be,
I may need to be proactive and issue an apology.

344
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,640
Yeah

345
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,920
What's this about?

346
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,190
All right, hold on.It's Sherry Palmer.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
She wants to come here in 5 minutes.

348
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
- Why?
- She wouldn't say.

349
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Except that it's a high value proposition,
and she wants to present it face to face.

350
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Set it up

351
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
All right, the Senator will be here.

352
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,100
This should be interesting

353
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,800
I will off load the systems in Field Ops.

354
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:18,400
I will be right up.

355
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,799
- Adam, where's Tony?
- He's with Jane Saunders

356
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,100
Kim's waiting to be debriefed on the shooting
and I am working with NHS.

357
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
NHS? Why aren't you tracking Saunders?

358
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,099
I don't know.

359
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Tony put Chloe in charge of that.

360
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,700
- Where's Chloe?
- Tech one

361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
Why isn't she in Field Ops?

362
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,300
You haven't talked to Tony yet?

363
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:33,199
About what?

364
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,000
Jack, it looks like someone from Tony's group intentionally
wiped out those SAT frames from the Saunders' surveillance

365
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:41,299
- That's how he was able to evade us.
- What?

366
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,900
Adam, NHS wants those coordinates now, or they
are going to have to widen the quarantine zone.

367
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,599
Ok. That's all I know, Jack.

368
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
I got to get back on this.
Ok, fine

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
We may be moving you in a few minutes.

370
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,400
- Where?
- To Division.

371
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,000
- What's that?

372
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
- Yeah
- Tony, it's Jack.I need to speak with you.

373
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,200
Meet me outside the observation room.

374
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah, all right.I will be right back.

375
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Jack,What the hell's going on?

376
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,500
Adam just told me that you think you have got
someone on the inside working with Saunders.

377
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,800
Well, it hasn't been confirmed yet.
Chloe's working on it.

378
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:31,499
What's she doing?

379
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,450
She's taking a look at status logs,
to see if she can find anything out of the ordinary.

380
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,400
Tony, if this is true, we have got to call Division,
get Spec Ops down here immediately.

381
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,500
I thought about that.

382
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,300
But I don't want to raise any red flags.

383
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,200
If someone in our group is working with Saunders,
I don't want them to know that we are onto them.

384
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,699
Ok, fine.You and I will work this up together.

385
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,600
But I want division to come pick up Jane so
they can continue questioning her.

386
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,500
Good idea.

387
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,200
I will call Brad Hammond, I will meet you in
tech one, we'll go through everything with Chloe.

388
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,100
No, wait, Jack

389
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Look, I have a 30 minute status call
scheduled with Hammond, anyway

390
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,700
Why don't you let me tell him and
you can go up to Field Ops?

391
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,600
Ok, fine

392
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Adam.Is Tony set up for 30 minute
status calls with Brad Hammond?

393
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,100
- If he is, it's not in the books.
- Thanks.

394
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Thank you very much

395
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,200
- John, hello
- Sherry

396
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,700
How nice to see you. I don't believe you
know Mark Kaner, my campaign manager.

397
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,900
No, I don't. Only by reputation.Pleased to meet you.

398
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:10,300
How do you do?

399
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
So what brings you here?

400
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, actually, it's a private mater, John.

401
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,800
Let us have a minute, Mark

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,900
No problem

403
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,400
Please

404
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,300
I heard about the endorsements you lost this morning.

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,700
Daily fluctuation. It doesn't mean a thing.

406
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,199
Doesn't mean a thing

407
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
That's pretty optimistic, John.

408
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,500
No, your campaign is imploding.

409
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,500
By the time the press has a chance to analyze
all the mistakes you made last night

410
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,600
You will look like a desperate candidate
gasping his last breath.

411
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,700
Look, Sherry, if you just came
here to insult me, I am rather busy

412
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,599
No, no, no, John.

413
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,499
On the contrary. Relax.

414
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:03,200
I, I came here because I can
guarantee you a win in November.

415
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,100
John, what I am about to tell you, I will deny to
my grave if you try to hold it against me.

416
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,900
So that's clear, right?

417
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,100
John, we are clear on that, right?

418
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,600
Good

419
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,400
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

420
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,500
- Who's murder?
- Alan Milliken

421
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,850
Alan Milliken died of a heart attack.

422
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes, he did, but he didn't have to.

423
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,099
His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length away.

424
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,800
But he couldn't get to it because someone kept it from him.

425
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,400
Now how could you possibly know that?

426
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,300
Because that someone was me.

427
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,900
Sherry, I think you had better leave right now.

428
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,100
Really?

429
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,100
So you can watch your entire career leave with me?

430
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,800
If what you are saying is true,
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

431
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:07,200
Oh, come on, spare me, John.

432
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
You haven't gotten this far without getting
a little dirt under your fingernails.

433
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:11,900
I don't know what you are talking about.

434
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,500
No. Of course not.

435
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,400
But for the sake of conversation,
just allow me to paint you a picture.

436
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,299
I¡­

437
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Please, it won't take but a moment

438
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:21,300
Just indulge me.

439
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,400
Very well

440
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,800
David lied to the Chief of Police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

441
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,900
And I can prove that he lied.

442
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,700
No, you think about that.

443
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,000
Proof that the President of the United States
lied to cover a murder.

444
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,200
What kind of proof?

445
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
Besides my confession?

446
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,100
I have the prescription bottle he was reaching for.

447
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:52,900
I was holding it.

448
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,700
And I have it in a very safe place.

449
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,400
You are talking about incriminating yourself.

450
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,700
You would go to prison.

451
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Yes, I know that.

452
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
But so would David

453
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,800
David lied to the police to save himself.

454
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,700
It's quite simple, John

455
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,800
All you have to do is go to David and
tell him that you have this evidence

456
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:21,399
This medicine bottle with my fingerprints on it

457
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,700
And I guarantee you David will drop out of the race.

458
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,400
The party will be thrown into turmoil and nobody, I
mean nobody will be able to touch you come November.

459
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,800
And for all of this?

460
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,500
You will put me on the White House staff.

461
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,599
Nothing so high that it will raise too many eyebrows.

462
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,900
All of this for you to be a mid level
staffer in my administration?

463
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,200
You and I both know that it would
be a little more than that.

464
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,600
So you are saying the casualty estimates
have been projected upward.

465
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,750
Yes sir, I am afraid so

466
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:33,900
By a factor of how many?

467
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
Now that the virus is out of the hotel
and not completely contained.

468
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,000
It could be as high as times five

469
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
All right, thanks, Dan. Keep me posted.

470
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes, sir.

471
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,700
What's it?

472
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,700
I just got off the phone with one of
my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.

473
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,700
Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler.

474
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,800
- When?
- Just now

475
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Meeting Keeler about what?

476
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
He didn't know. David

477
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
So I was hoping you'd have some idea.

478
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,100
I don't know what she's doing.

479
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,000
But we can't worry about that now.

480
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,200
There are people dying here in Los Angeles.

481
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah, well, I don't like it, David

482
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,800
- So let me put someone on this.
- No.

483
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,400
I brought Sherry in to fix
a problem, and look what happened.

484
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,500
Just let it be.

485
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
We will hear soon enough.

486
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,600
What do you see?

487
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,300
They are trying to use the open
phone switches to find us.

488
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,700
The phone I called him with is shut off.

489
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
They can't triangulate me, can they?

490
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,900
Not quickly.

491
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,700
But they can try a trial and error process
and that could get them close.

492
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,400
And that's what they are doing?

493
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,400
Looks like it

494
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,800
Then we will have to stop them

495
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,500
Come with me

496
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,700
Your office is using our last
phone conversation to locate us.

497
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,500
How are they doing it?

498
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,800
I am committed to getting my daughter back.

499
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,400
You kill me and that'll never happen.

500
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,200
That's not the only option.

501
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,400
You are an attractive woman.

502
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,100
I am guessing your husband would prefer
you returned without a disfigurement.

503
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,800
I am not telling you anything.

504
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,900
I have to talk to Almeida.

505
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,100
Keep your conversation short.

506
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,900
Almeida.Let me paint you a picture

507
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I have a sharp knife, the tip of which is drawing
blood from your wife's face right now.

508
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,400
If whatever you are doing to trace these phone calls
doesn't stoop in 30 seconds, she'll be unrecognizable.

509
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,400
O'Brian

510
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Shut down the trace.

511
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Shut it down?I am just starting to get something.

512
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,900
Do it now, Chloe.

513
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,600
fine.Let me at least see if I can unscramble the audio

514
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:05,300
No, I need you to hold off for a few minutes.

515
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,199
This doesn't make sense, Tony

516
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
I thought you wanted me to find Saunders.

517
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,500
I do. I will explain it to you later.

518
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,799
What are you doing?

519
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,299
I am trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.

520
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Somebody in my own group may be working against us, I
have quarantine zones springing up all over the place

521
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,600
I am treading water here, Jack

522
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,100
Why are you lying to me?

523
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,750
Lying? What are you talking about?

524
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,900
I just got off the phone with Hammond.

525
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,200
You didn't have a status call scheduled.

526
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,300
I screwed up earlier.

527
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,800
The SAT transmission on my system
was forged by my own people.

528
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,900
I should have noticed that it wasn't authentic
before I ordered Baker off his post, I didn't

529
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,700
By the time I realized my mistake,
it was too late. Saunders was gone.

530
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,499
What about the missing frames?

531
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,100
They must have been deleted by the same
person who forged the SAT transmission.

532
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Look, I know this is big, Jack, and I promise you
I will offer my resignation when this day is over.

533
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:57,300
Right now we got too much
going on for me to step down.

534
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,900
Making a mistake is one thing.

535
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,200
Covering it up is another.

536
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,799
I can't let you stay in place.

537
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,900
I am taking over command of CTU now.

538
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:04,800
I made a mistake, Jack

539
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,700
No, Tony

540
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
You made two

541
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,900
Fine. I will make sure Adam sends over
everything I have got to your group.

542
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,100
Tony, I narrowed down the list.

543
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,500
What list?

544
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,600
The list of people on your team that can't account
for their time when the SAT frames went missing

545
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,600
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Tony, it's very likely that someone on this
list is working from within CTU to help Saunders.

547
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,900
Look, Adam, I am not in charge of CTU anymore.

548
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
What are you talking about?

549
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,800
Jack and I have decided it'd be best if he took over.

550
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,000
Why don't you send that list over
to Hammond, all right?

551
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,600
Yes

552
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,200
I got a problem

553
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,200
What problem?

554
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,700
Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command

555
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,600
Why did he do that?

556
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,600
He found out I'd deleted those satellite frames.

557
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,500
Does he know about our communication?

558
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,600
No, not yet. He thinks I am just covering my mistake.

559
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,300
But he's gonna find out soon.

560
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,400
Then I suggest you get my daughter
out of there before he does.

561
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Look, I might not be able to do this.

562
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,100
I no longer have any authority at CTU.

563
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,000
You don't' need authority, Tony.

564
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,500
You just need to know that if you don't
deliver Jane for whatever reason,

565
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:01,599
your wife will die just like Ryan Chappelle died.

566
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,900
Just like the people at the
Chandler Plaza Hotel died.

567
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,900
I am gonna try to get her out, but if I can't

568
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,500
If you can't, Michelle dies.

569
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Don't call me again until you have Jane safely away

570
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,700
- Dad.- Kim, I need you to help me with something

571
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,599
You are gonna have to clear it with Tony

572
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,100
He wants me to debrief with Rae Plachecki about
what's going on with Jane Saunders.

573
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:40,800
Tony just stepped down.

574
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,300
I am acting director of CTU until further notice.

575
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,900
What do you mean Tony stepped down?

576
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,000
Tony's hiding something from me.

577
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,700
I need you to help me find out what it is.

578
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,399
Why me?

579
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,700
Because right now I don't know who to trust.

580
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,299
I need you to maintain a surveillance
on every station here at CTU

581
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,800
Anyone who checks in or out, and I also want you to
track communications that flag higher than a code 2.

582
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,500
Where do you want me to do that?

583
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Field Ops. Come on.

584
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:06,900
Thanks

585
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,400
Almeida

586
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,600
Good news, Tony

587
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,799
What is it?

588
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,400
I found a way to pull the voice track on the
phone call you had with Saunders.

589
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,000
Have you listened to it yet?

590
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,899
No. The algorithm is still running.

591
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,900
But once that's complete, I will be able to do an
analysis on the ambient sound and room tone.

592
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
All right, good work

593
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,700
Adam, I want you to send your
volumes up to Kim's computer

594
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
I have her checking something for me.

595
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:06,199
Ok

596
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
Is Chloe still in Tech One?

597
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
As far as I know, she is.

598
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,400
Have her come up to my office,
I need to speak with her.

599
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,200
Ok, I will, Jack

600
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,300
Kaufman

601
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Yeah, Adam, I am on the line with Chloe

602
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,900
We need the password to Etudes 4

603
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
It's BCF19

604
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,000
All right, thanks

605
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,800
Yeah, Oh, Tony, Jack needs to see
Chloe in his office right away.

606
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,900
All right, I will tell her

607
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,700
Thank you

608
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,200
Where is she?

609
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,300
She is here

610
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,800
Put her on

611
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,300
No

612
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,800
You have my wife, I want to talk to her first

613
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,300
You have my wife, I want to talk to her first

614
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
You have my wife?

615
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,800
Hello? Hello?

616
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,500
¸ÃËÀ

617
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Help, somebody help, I am locked in

618
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,500
Tech one, I am locked in

619
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,300
Just hold on for a second

620
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Everybody, can I have your attention?

621
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Just stop working for a second. I need your attention.

622
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,300
From this point forward, I am taking command of CTU.

623
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,100
That includes Field Ops and all communications.

624
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,400
Tony Almeida has stepped down.

625
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
He is no longer in charge.

626
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,700
I am taking Jane Saunders to Division.

627
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Here's the order.

628
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,800
I don't have time to go into details, because right
now we have to focus on finding Stephen Saunders.

629
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,999
Come on, Pete, this is the order right here.

630
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You don't believe me, call Division
talk to them yourself.

631
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,800
So unless you are working directly with NHS in defining
the quarantine zones, I need you to get involved.

632
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,500
Check with your superiors,
they will hand out your assignments.

633
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,500
We need to find this guy. Now.

634
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,800
We are leaving right now.

635
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:49,499
Ok

636
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,200
We are going out this way

637
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,200
Chase, Chloe hasn't refreshed her
current tables in over 15 minutes.

638
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,700
I thought she was working on the main system.

639
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:06,600
Yeah, she was

640
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,900
That's weird

641
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,000
She never forgets to do that

642
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,700
What's going on?

643
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,700
Have you seen Chloe?

644
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,900
Yeah, she's over in Tech One

645
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,400
Where are all the guards?

646
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,100
We don't need those guards anymore.

647
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,200
Why not? I thought you were worried about
my father sending men in to get me

648
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,300
We have agents on the streets,
don't worry about it

649
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,300
Kim, why can't I get a feed on Tech One?

650
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Hang on

651
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,300
Someone blocked it.

652
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,300
We have a hostile inside.
Override the access code now.

653
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,800
Perimeter security, I need a 20 on Chloe O'Brian.

654
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
And a priority one sweep of the entire building

655
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,000
Cover the back entrance.

656
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,799
Jack

657
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
Chloe, step away from the computer. Now

658
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,499
Tony locked me in here

659
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,200
Saunders has Michelle, he's using her as
leverage to get his daughter out.

660
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,300
Don't move

661
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,700
Security, this is Jack Bauer

662
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:16,900
I need a 20 on Tony Almeida

663
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,000
I repeat, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida

664
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,399
Negative, Jack

665
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
He's not on any of the monitors.

666
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,800
When did he lock you in here?

667
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,500
About 2 minutes ago

668
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,800
Have security lock down the entire building

669
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,300
Adam, I want every SAT within range trained on us.

670
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,300
I want to know everything that's exiting this building

671
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:43,550
Who's watching Jane Saunders?

672
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,800
Both guards are down, she's gone

673
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,700
Tony

674
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,000
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida

675
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,900
This is Almeida. We are out. I have got her

676
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,000
How long until satellite finds you?

677
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:10,000
About 30 minutes

678
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,700
I will give you further instructions in 20 minutes.

679
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,000
Be at the northeast corner of Taylor and Vine.

680
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah, right.

681
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Call President Palmer, tell him I need to
speak with him in person



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

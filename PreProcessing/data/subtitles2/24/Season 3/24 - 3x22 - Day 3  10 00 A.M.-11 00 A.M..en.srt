1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,599
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,100
I just got off the phone with one of
my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.

3
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:24,500
Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler.

4
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,500
Meeting Keeler about what?

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:27,799
He didn't know. David

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,800
I came here because I can guarantee you a win in November.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,999
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
David lied to the Chief of Police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,650
Why are you lying to me?

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,099
I screwed up earlier.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,000
The SAT transmission on my system
was forged by my own people.

12
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,550
Making a mistake is one thing.

13
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,925
Covering it up is another.

14
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,299
I can't let you stay in place.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,400
I am taking over command of CTU now.

16
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,600
I made a mistake, Jack

17
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,200
No, Tony

18
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,799
You made two

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,499
I am going to let you speak to your husband

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,200
Tell him that you are ok and
you are being treated well.

21
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,200
Are you all right?

22
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:05,899
I am fine

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,499
Don't let them do this, don't let??

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,600
If Jane is not release when
I order it, your wife dies.

25
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,800
That's all you need to know.

26
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:14,799
Are we clear?

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,300
From this point on, I am assuming control of CTU.

28
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,299
Tony Almeida has stepped down.

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,600
We are taking Jane Saunders to Division.

30
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:24,699
Here's the order.

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,200
- We are leaving right now.
- Ok

32
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,700
Going out this way right here.

33
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,099
Where are all the guards?

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,000
We don't need those guards anymore.

35
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,699
Jack, Tony locked me in here

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,100
Saunders has Michelle, he's using her as
leverage to get his daughter out.

37
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,799
This is Almeida. We are out. I have got her

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,700
I will give you further instructions in 20 minutes.

39
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:48,700
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,900
The following takes place
between 10:00 am and 11:00 am.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,399
Excuse me

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,700
Chloe, I want you to pull up all the
surveillance tape from every exit in this building.

43
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,699
I want you to focus on the last 10 minutes.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,400
Adam, have you linked up with
traffic surveillance yet?

45
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,899
I'm working on top chance.

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,900
Jack, I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders
out of the building without authorization.

47
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,350
- That's right
- Why?

48
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,799
Saunders has Michelle.

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,100
He wants to trade her for his daughter.

50
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,400
Jane Saunders is the only leverage we have.

51
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,899
Trust me, Chase. I know that.

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,400
I got him. He left the building 3 minutes ago,
and drove off the premises 90 seconds later.

53
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,299
Adam, he's in a silver SUV.

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,699
Chase, I want you to prep the tactical team.

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,000
- Be ready to move as soon as I give you an order.
- All right.

56
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,999
I got him, Jack

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
He's on 5th about half a mile
from here, heading east.

58
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:33,600
I will call you from the car.

59
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,250
Son of a bitch

60
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:46,199
Are you ok?

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,499
It's just traffic.

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,050
You have been acting all wired since we left.

63
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,599
Yeah, well, there's a lot going on right now.

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,500
You never really explained why you wanted
to transfer me to this division place.

65
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,199
I told you.

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,099
I know what you told me. It doesn't make sense.

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Yeah, well, I don't have the time
to explain it to you right now.

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,899
Almeida got my daughter out of CTU.

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,300
You need to be ready to move the moment I tell you.

70
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,700
When are you calling Almeida with instructions?

71
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:19,700
15 minutes. I will be with Fredrick.

72
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,099
At least 700 people are dead or
dying in the Chandler Plaza Hotel

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,800
because Saunders released a weaponized
virus into the ventilation system

74
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:38,899
What the media is reporting is a cover story.

75
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,900
They are deflecting the truth to avoid mass panic.

76
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,299
You will be infected along with everyone else

77
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,300
No matter what he's paying you,
it's not worth losing your life

78
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Jack is in pursuit of Tony. Move out
as soon as we get a location on Saunders. Understand?

79
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:03,099
Good

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,099
- Kim
- Yeah

81
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,199
What are you doing?

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,300
I am working with a team that's monitoring my father.

83
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought you were setting up a tactical unit.

84
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,299
Yeah, I am

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,200
We have to wait until we get a location on Saunders.

86
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,000
Until then, we are pretty much on standby.

87
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,699
- All right
- Listen

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,300
Before I have to go back out there,
I want to talk to you.

89
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,350
About what?

90
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:24,399
About us

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I need to know whether there's going to be an us.

92
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Look, I have been thinking about it a lot, and...

93
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,199
the baby changes everything.

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,100
It doesn't change the way I feel about you.

95
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,999
Look, let's forget about me for a second.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have a daughter and a job
that won't let you be with her.

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,099
Is that you talking, or your father?

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
My dad would be the first one to admit it.

99
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,399
He wasn't the greatest dad.

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
And it wasn't because he didn't love me.

101
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,899
I know he loved me.

102
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,899
It was because of his job

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
If I transferred out of Field Ops,
would you consider staying with me?

104
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,499
I want to stay with you,

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
and I would raise a child with you, Chase.

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I just won't raise one for you

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,300
Adam, is he still on 5th street?

108
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:40,299
No, I lost him

109
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,800
He must have turned between Jarvis and Hill.

110
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,000
Widen the search

111
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,499
I am

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,699
Ok, Jack, I have got him

113
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,150
He's going south on Vine, 2 blocks below Hill

114
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,600
- You can save some time by...
- Ok, I got it

115
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,099
He's hit traffic at Fillmore.

116
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You might be able to intercept on Grant.

117
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,199
Look, I know you are lying to me

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I know you are not taking me to division.

119
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,650
You will be fine, Jane. All right?

120
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,100
At least tell me where we are going

121
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,400
Where are you taking me?

122
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,300
Back to your father

123
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:24,800
My father?

124
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,199
Why?

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,199
He's holding my wife hostage,

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,900
and he will kill her if I don't take you back to him

127
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:37,900
So, basically, you are kidnapping me.

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,099
I am sorry

129
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,800
After everything he's done,
how can you be sure he'll do what he says?

130
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:47,700
How do you know he won't kill your wife, anyway?

131
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:51,600
I don't have a choice.

132
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:55,500
I wish I did, but I don't

133
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Tony, put that gun on the dash

134
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,300
Put that gun on the dash, now!

135
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Slowly get out of the car

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,099
Jane,

137
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,100
stay where you are, everything is going to be fine.

138
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,700
Saunders has Michelle.

139
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,799
I know

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,700
He wants to make a trade, Michelle for his daughter

141
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,399
I know. I can't let that happen

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,700
Look, I almost lost her once today, Jack

143
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,700
I am not losing her again.

144
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,399
Tony, listen to me

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,699
I understand exactly how you are feeling.
I have been there.

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,800
And you handled it just like me,
you kept everyone outside of it.

147
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:56,999
Tony, this is different.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,250
Millions of lives are at stake

149
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,475
Oh, rules apply to other people

150
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:00,699
But not to you, right, Jack?

151
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,799
Tony, just calm down, ok? Come on

152
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,300
You help me make this trade,
I will turn myself in.

153
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,800
Go to prison, whatever is gotta happen.

154
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,199
I can't do it

155
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,950
We need Jane to lure her father in.

156
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,700
Even if it means Michelle's gotta die.

157
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,200
Michelle doesn't have to die.

158
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,699
We can string Saunders along.

159
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,799
I need you to start working with me

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Chase has already got a strike team mobile.

161
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,099
No, no, no, no

162
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,500
Saunders sees I brought CTU into this,
he kills Michelle

163
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,700
He's not going to know we are there.

164
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:30,899
Tony, where are you meeting him?

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,100
Tony, you don't have a choice right now

166
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,300
You've got to work with me on this

167
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:37,199
Where is the meeting?

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Come on, where are you meeting him?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,300
He wants me to be at a public pay phone
at the corner of Taylor and Vine in 5 minutes.

170
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:52,300
He'll give me further instructions from there.

171
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,499
Thank you

172
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
You are doing the right thing

173
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,200
The quarantined areas are circled in red

174
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,100
Now, as far as we know, we have containment.

175
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,399
We are still not certain?

176
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,300
No. But we can't really be certain for hours.

177
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,050
Maybe days.

178
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,799
David, listen

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,900
The press is breathing down Gerry's neck pretty hard.

180
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,100
Now, he thinks we should release a statement.

181
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,499
I already have.

182
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I have closed down public transportation and
I have told the people to stay in their homes.

183
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,099
We have F18s patrolling the skies.

184
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah, but we haven't revealed the exact
nature of this threat and the press is picking up on that.

185
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:56,800
We have 10 million people spread
out over 4000 square mile area.

186
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:00,850
If even a small percentage decide to leave at the same time,

187
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,899
it will ignite a public panic
beyond anything we could control.

188
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,900
The right thing to do is to withhold the
truth until we are sure the virus is contained.

189
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I will tell Gerry to hold off
on the press as long as he can.

190
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,500
Mr. President

191
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:26,299
Yes, Jeannie.

192
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Senator Keeler's here to see you

193
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,300
Have him brought in

194
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:37,300
Yes sir.

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,100
Hello, John

196
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,699
Mr. President

197
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,099
Please take a seat

198
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,299
Thank you. I will stand

199
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,100
You can imaging my surprise when
I was told that you wanted to see me.

200
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you withdrawing from the race?

201
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,499
Mr. President,

202
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,200
with respect to the death of Alan Milliken,

203
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,300
I know you lied to the police.

204
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,499
Excuse me?

205
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
You obstructed the investigation of a capital crime.

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,999
That's a baseless charge, John.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Though I have come to expect this
kind of recklessness from you

208
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:27,500
No, sir, it's neither baseless nor reckless.

209
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,200
This is a photograph of the nitroglycerine
medicine that would have saved Milliken's life.

210
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
If it hadn't been kept from him

211
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,300
You told the police Sherry was with
you at the time of Milliken's death.

212
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:53,300
Her fingerprints on this
prescription bottle prove otherwise.

213
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,599
Now...

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
the last thing this country
needs is to have its President...

215
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:04,200
dragged through the mud for complicity in a murder

216
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Why are you showing me this, John?

217
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,350
What do you want?

218
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:12,399
Your resignation.

219
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,099
Not immediately, of course.

220
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,799
But once this crisis you are dealing with is over,

221
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,800
you can resign with whatever
face saving reason you want to give.

222
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,499
Get out of here.

223
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,800
I am offering you the chance to leave office with honor

224
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:37,800
to control how your legacy is written.

225
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,900
It's a good deal, David

226
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:49,900
You should take it

227
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,399
He's going to call in one minute.
I should go to the phone

228
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Ok, as soon as Saunders tells you
where he wants he exchange to take place,

229
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,699
you need to reject the location.

230
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,500
We need to force him into picking a secondary
location so Chase has time to embed his teams.

231
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,800
If I don't show up where and when
Saunders wants me to, he's going to kill Michelle.

232
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,600
Not as long as we have his daughter.

233
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:33,800
What if he doesn't go for it?

234
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:34,799
Don't give him a choice.

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,700
You have got some leverage here, Tony, use it.

236
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:43,700
All right. I need to go.

237
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,700
My father kidnapped his wife because of me?

238
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:04,099
Something like that.

239
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,699
And now you want to use me as bait to get to him.

240
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,700
We are going to do whatever we have to to
stop your father from releasing this virus.

241
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Stay here. We'll be right back

242
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,299
Where are we meeting?

243
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,899
First, let me speak with my daughter.

244
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,900
No. You can talk to her when we make the exchange.

245
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,099
All right.

246
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Bring her to an industrial pack 3 miles
north of where you are, on Maltin Road.

247
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:58,500
A car will be waiting at loading dock 22.

248
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:01,900
Choose a new place. That doesn't work

249
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,099
Make it work

250
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,900
You have got 10 minutes to get to the
industrial park or your wife will die.

251
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,700
If we meet there, we all die.

252
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,499
Really?

253
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,199
CTU has redundant satellite surveillance of that area.

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,650
They are dedicating all their resources
to finding me right now

255
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:17,100
If you want your daughter back safely,
you pick a new spot.

256
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,799
I am not negotiating terms, Mr. Almeida.

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,199
I have planned too long and too hard for this day

258
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,400
and I will do whatever it takes
to make sure nothing interferes.

259
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:29,199
Even...

260
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,399
even if it means sacrificing my daughter.

261
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You need to understand my commitment, Mr. Almeida

262
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,850
What the hell are you doing? He wasn't going for it.

263
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,500
He is testing you. He's heard what you had to say.

264
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,400
He'll phone back. Now hang up the phone.

265
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,199
How you know?

266
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,099
Because right now he thinks
I am going to kill his daughter.

267
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
The only reason why he exposed himself
is to make sure she's still safe.

268
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,300
Maybe that's what you'd do, Jack

269
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,599
But you are not Saunders.

270
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,200
No matter how well you think
you know this guy, you are not him.

271
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,199
This isn't a game, Jack

272
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,699
We are talking about my wife.

273
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,900
Michelle's got a better chance of surviving if we control
the ground where the exchange is supposed to take place.

274
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:01,699
But protecting her is not your priority, is it?

275
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,700
If she were to get killed, that would
be an acceptable loss, wouldn't it?

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,999
My god, Jack,

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,700
Didn't you learn anything from what happened to Terry?

278
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:13,600
Shut up, Tony

279
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:18,600
Shut up

280
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,799
Tony

281
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Just because you sacrificed your wife for
this job doesn't mean I am going to sacrifice mine.

282
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,899
I am here

283
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,899
Make no mistake

284
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,700
This is your first and your last accommodation.

285
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:03,500
Just tell me where you want to make the exchange.

286
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:07,200
Downtown, under the 6th street bridge.

287
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,000
Under the 6th street bridge.

288
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,999
Be there in 30 minutes

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,300
But if I see that you have brought anyone else into this,

290
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:19,300
I will kill your wife.

291
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,900
You did great

292
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,799
Tony Almeida's going to make the exchange,

293
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,000
but until we get confirmation that Saunders is on site,

294
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,299
we stay invisible.

295
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,300
I will assign positions on the way out. Let's go.

296
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,199
What is it?

297
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
Satellite pictures of 6th street bridge.

298
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,099
I asked for a real time feed, Kim

299
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
We will have it, too, by the time we are on site.

300
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,299
What about air support?

301
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,800
We are coordinating with the Marines.

302
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:03,700
They will move on your order.

303
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,650
They will move on your order.

304
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,125
Look, Chase, please be careful

305
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,600
Look, Chase, please be careful

306
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Don't worry about me. I will be fine.

307
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Chloe, how much time before you can setup
a real time satellite feed for the 6th street bridge?

308
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Do you really think Chase is going
to quit field ops to start a family?

309
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,699
He won't

310
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,200
I don't know where you are getting this from,
but it's none of your business.

311
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,499
I have known Chase for 3 years.

312
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,700
You have been dating him for 3 months.

313
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,199
And your point being?

314
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
He might be a great guy, but he's just like your father

315
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:45,299
They are both the same person.

316
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,300
So if you are expecting him to leave this
for the suburbs, you should revise your expectations.

317
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
When can you uplink a satellite feed?

318
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,000
10 minutes

319
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,299
Then do it

320
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,300
I am just trying to be a friend, Kim. That's all

321
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,099
Hello

322
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,499
You have gone too far this time, Sherry

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,799
You know, I thought I might be hearing from you, David

324
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
You sent Keeler over here to blackmail
me into giving up my presidency?

325
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down

326
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,299
You mean Keeler paid you a visit?

327
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,099
You know damn well he did and you know why

328
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,500
Only one person could have given him that
prescription bottle and that's you

329
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,100
Ok, supposing that was true.

330
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,099
What then?

331
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,700
You should go to jail for murder.

332
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,300
You should go to jail, too, David

333
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,499
You lied to the police.

334
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,700
You told them that I was with you all night

335
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,900
Withholding evidence, obstruction of justice.

336
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,199
Those are serious crimes

337
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,800
I knew you always wanted to
go down in the history books, David.

338
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:45,200
But I am not certain like this. Am I right?

339
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,799
What did Keeler offer you, Sherry?

340
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Exactly what you should have offered me,
respect and a seat at the table,

341
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,299
but instead you called me up when you needed me

342
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,300
and then after I did your little dirty work,
You threw me out like an old pair of shoes.

343
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,099
You know me, Sherry,

344
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,899
better than anyone, and you know I won't be bullied.

345
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,700
So before this goes too far,
you better ask yourself a question.

346
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,899
Are you willing to go to jail?

347
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,600
You know, David, I have asked
myself that a million times

348
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:20,200
and the answer is yes, I am willing to go to jail

349
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:25,200
The question is, are you?

350
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I didn't think so.

351
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,250
I want the strike teams split into 2 groups

352
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,499
Group A can take cover here, group B back here.

353
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,699
I want them briefed and
ready to go as soon as we get there.

354
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,800
If Saunders sees anyone other than Tony or his
daughter, he's not going to make the approach.

355
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,400
What's the response time for air support?

356
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,200
30 seconds, after I give the order.

357
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,200
I will relay the coordinates.

358
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,200
I will see you at the bridge.

359
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:58,799
You got it

360
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I know my father released the
virus in the hotel that people died.

361
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,100
But do you really think he'll do what he's saying?

362
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:15,100
Release it all over the country?

363
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,200
If we don't stop him, yes.

364
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,699
Why?

365
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,399
There has to be a reason he's doing all of this

366
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,400
When I worked with your father, he dedicated
himself to saving the lives of innocent people.

367
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,000
Something has happened to him

368
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,399
I don't know what

369
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
But now he believes our government's betrayed him

370
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:40,200
Is he right?

371
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,899
There's no easy answer to that.

372
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,900
The work that your father did often demanded that
he make seemingly impossible sacrifices.

373
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia
was obviously a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make.

374
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I am sorry

375
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,899
No

376
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,300
Shut up! No one can hear you.

377
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,699
No

378
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Shut up now

379
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:16,300
No

380
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,299
No! Oh God

381
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,799
I said stop, stop screaming

382
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Look at me, I have been infected.

383
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:31,600
Help me, help me, help me¡­

384
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,999
Help

385
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We got a problem here

386
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,000
What's going on?

387
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,199
She has it

388
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,299
She has the virus

389
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,699
What are you talking about?

390
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,150
She's bleeding, she must have caught it at the hotel

391
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:47,600
They wouldn't have release her without testing her

392
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,499
It's a trick

393
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,750
She did it to herself

394
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:56,000
Kevin, are you there?

395
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:01,000
Kevin

396
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
All right, take the east corridor

397
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:30,700
Stop her from getting aboveground

398
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:35,700
But do not shoot to kill

399
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
(No Service)

400
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
CTU, O'Brian

401
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,400
It's Michelle

402
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,699
Hello?

403
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,099
Chloe, can you here me?

404
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,800
Whoever this is, I have a really a bad connection.

405
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,300
I have got a lot of stuff to do right now

406
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:15,300
Chloe

407
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,900
So what did Keeler want?

408
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:44,299
My job

409
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,900
He has proof that Sherry was at Alan Milliken's tonight

410
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:48,799
What?

411
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,199
What, what proof?

412
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

413
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
How did he get a hold of this?

414
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,900
How do you think?

415
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:09,199
Sherry

416
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,050
I talked to her a few minutes ago.

417
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:12,575
She didn't even bother to deny it

418
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,099
David, she's got to be bluffing

419
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,400
I mean, if this gets out, she goes to jail.

420
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,899
So will I

421
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,600
She figures I have more to lose than she does

422
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:26,399
And she's right

423
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,899
What does Keeler want you to do?

424
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,700
Withdraw from the race for whatever reason I choose.

425
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,899
The party gets thrown into chaos,

426
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,900
whoever takes my place won't
have a prayer in the election,

427
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,900
and Keeler becomes President.

428
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:49,099
Oh, my god

429
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,100
This is all my fault

430
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:55,499
Hey, look

431
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
We both made mistakes

432
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I am the one who called Sherry

433
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,300
There may be a way out of this

434
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,799
How

435
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,900
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?

436
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,299
What are you suggesting?

437
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,000
That we take away the only leverage she has.

438
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:29,700
You mean, steal evidence.

439
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:30,799
My god, Wayne

440
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,399
Before you say no, you just think about this, ok?

441
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Now, I can call Foxton,
and he can make this all disappear.

442
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:41,400
All you have to do is give me the ok

443
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,650
- Stay with her
- Yes, sir.

444
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,675
Is your strike team in place?

445
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,288
2 minutes, they will be ready

446
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,644
You sure they will be of sight?

447
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:30,000
They will be invisible, Tony

448
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:30,899
Ok

449
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,600
I am gonna back Tony up here at the 6th street bridge.

450
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,300
We should get in position now.

451
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,000
Jack, priority call from Kim

452
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,499
This is Jack

453
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,800
Dad, I got Michelle on the line

454
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,699
Is she with Saunders

455
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,100
No, she said she get away from him.

456
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,200
Patch her through

457
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,299
Hold on

458
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,599
Michelle, go ahead

459
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,100
I got away from Saunders, but he's still after me

460
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:54,450
Michelle, it's me. Where are you?

461
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:57,799
Wilshire, a block east of Olive

462
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,100
Chase, send your strike team in now.

463
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:00,099
Chase, don't

464
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,899
What are you talking about?

465
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,000
Michelle, I want you to listen to me very carefully

466
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,200
I want you to let Saunders catch you again.

467
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:05,999
What, are you crazy?

468
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,499
We have to let the exchange go down

469
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,900
It's the only way we are gonna catch him

470
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,399
You want me to give myself up?

471
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Yes, the exchange site is secure, I will send our
people in as soon as we know he's there.

472
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,800
- Chase, redirect your people now.That's an order.
- Chase, don't!

473
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:20,699
Jack, stay out of this

474
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,900
You are not in command here

475
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,099
Get him out of here, now

476
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
Jack, Jack, that's my wife, Jack

477
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,000
You son of a bitch

478
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,500
It's my wife

479
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,699
Jack

480
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,299
We need this exchange to go through

481
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,499
Everything depends on it, do you understand me?

482
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,400
Michelle, if he doesn't have you for trade,
he won't go through with the meeting

483
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:43,300
Look, we are not going to get another chance at it

484
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:46,400
Do you understand, Michelle

485
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,099
Yes

486
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,000
We are gonna do everything we have to
to make sure you come out of this ok

487
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:53,099
But we have got to move now

488
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Let's get our teams into position

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I thought your brother was the kind of
politician who would never lower himself to my level

490
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,100
I need to recover something that
could cause him a great deal of trouble

491
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:06,999
What is it?

492
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,900
A bottle of medicine was taken from a crime scene.

493
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,600
Has it been admitted into evidence?

494
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:14,399
No.

495
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,099
It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer,
the President's ex-wife

496
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,000
I have a pretty good idea where she is right now, and I can
partially reconstruct where she's been since she stole it.

497
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,800
What kind of time frame are we looking at?

498
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,199
Hours, Foxton, not days.

499
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Has this operation been authorized by the President?

500
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
What difference does it make?

501
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,299
You will get your money

502
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,700
I am not worried about that,
I just need to know who I am working for

503
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,850
My brother knows what you are doing

504
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:49,000
Not that I don't trust you, but ...

505
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,600
I'd like to hear it from him

506
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:57,600
Fine

507
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's proof enough

508
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Let's go

509
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,600
Chase and his men have Saunders yet?

510
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:26,600
No one's coming yet

511
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,999
Look, Jack,

512
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,850
promise me you won't make a move on
Saunders until Michelle is safe.

513
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,700
We are going to move as soon as we have
got a visual on Saunders, Tony

514
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:50,600
That's the way it's got to go

515
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,299
I know

516
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,800
I am just asking you to do what you can

517
00:32:56,801 --> 00:33:01,799
You know I will

518
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,700
We have got 3 cars headed in from the west

519
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,700
Tony, they are coming. Are you ready?

520
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:13,700
Yeah

521
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,600
The windows are tinted. I can't see inside.

522
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,299
Yeah

523
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,299
Give her the phone

524
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,700
My preference is to turn you over to your husband unharmed

525
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:07,700
But I will kill you if anything goes wrong

526
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,999
Yeah

527
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,600
When I see my daughter, you will get your wife

528
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:53,199
All right

529
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Jane, I need you to get out of the car

530
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Ok, everything is going to be ok

531
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,900
I want you to walk over to your father's men

532
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,200
Where's my father?

533
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,799
We don't know

534
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,900
Listen, we have to do this, Jane

535
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:28,900
I am sorry

536
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,200
Look, Jane, you have got to trust me on this

537
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:37,200
Please go. Come on

538
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,199
Jack, send your men in now.

539
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,200
We don't have a visual on Saunders.
I repeat we don't have a visual on Saunders

540
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,099
I can't

541
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,600
- Hey, come here
- Jane, no, turn around

542
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,600
Jane, it's ok, come here

543
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,599
Team A and B move

544
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,700
We've got a visual on Saunders.

545
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:46,700
Move now

546
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Stephen

547
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,399
I am pinned down

548
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,700
Saunders has a helicopter

549
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:43,999
Call in air support now

550
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,500
I repeat, call in air support now

551
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:47,999
We need air support

552
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,900
I have got a flight of 2 US Marine F18s

553
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,900
Just off the marine.

554
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:51,900
Call sign Guardian Angel

555
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,499
Copy that

556
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,000
Guardian Angel, Guardian Angel, this is Watchdog.

557
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:02,000
We've got a hot on to victor bravo tango

558
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Jack, the Marines are coming in.

559
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:17,400
Take cover, I repeat, take cover.

560
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Chopper's been taken out

561
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,300
You ok?

562
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,199
Don't move

563
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,000
11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.

564
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,799
Where are they?

565
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
It's not going to be that simple, Jack

566
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,000
Stephen, it's over

567
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,199
No, it's not, Jack

568
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,900
It's just the beginning

569
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:58,599
Where are the vials?

570
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
You can waste time trying to break me and kill millions of people

571
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Or you can give me what I want.

572
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,699
This is Jack Bauer

573
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Saunders is in custody.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

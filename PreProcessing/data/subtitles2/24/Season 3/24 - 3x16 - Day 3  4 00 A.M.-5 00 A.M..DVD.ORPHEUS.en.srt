1
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,176
hi.Wow.Good morning,indeed.

2
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,041
You just missed a fascinating
hour on megalithomania.

3
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:32,312
Oh.That's my favorite.

4
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:36,473
Um,actually,could I talk to you for a minute?

5
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,261
Well,yeah.For you,I have more than a minute.

6
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:42,226
Well,I don't know how to say this,except.

7
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:51,209
being with you last night reminded me
of how much it hurt when you dumped me.

8
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,545
Oh,I--I prefer to say,"broke up with.

9
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:56,021
" See,and I can't get
my heart broken again,ricky.

10
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,231
So it was fun.

11
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,071
- Nina.
- Hey.

12
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,875
You take care of yourself.Ok?

13
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,720
Nina.Come on.

14
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,159
Nina,come on.

15
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,617
Are you happy now,darling?

16
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,747
As if that's possible.

17
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:29,526
Honey,you want a glass of wine?

18
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,366
No,thanks.

19
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,583
Makes me sleepy.

20
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,100
Melinda,you can't stay awake forever.

21
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:39,547
And lookin' at these masks is
not doin' you any good right now.

22
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:45,347
I'm just trying to figure out which mask the guy's wearing
in one of my dreams or memories,whatever they are.

23
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:47,108
I know,but maybe you should take a break.

24
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:48,764
I don't know.

25
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,862
Uh,maybe help kate cross over.

26
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:53,356
Staying away from that one.

27
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,719
- Really?
- Yeah.

28
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,232
Payne doesn't want my help.

29
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,733
He seems to think this is
his chance to get back at her,

30
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,530
and she doesn't wanna
go anywhere near a light,so.

31
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,291
yeah.I get it.

32
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,028
Mel,I'm worried about you.

33
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,818
You hardly get any sleep these days.

34
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,721
And when you do,your nightmares are getting worse.

35
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:15,655
The only way it's gonna stop is if I can figure out
who this mask guy is and what he's trying to tell me.

36
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:20,042
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my father.

37
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,756
Well,do you think you should talk to a professional?

38
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,087
I don't need therapy.

39
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,147
No,I mean,do you think you should
talk to a private investigator?

40
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,678
Remember my cop friend,carl neely?

41
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,180
It's what he does.He moonlights.

42
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:39,825
I mean,he could tell you how your
dad died,when,where he's buried,even.

43
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,483
You want me to call him?

44
00:08:58,646 --> 00:08:59,436
Ricky.

45
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,210
Hi.

47
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,325
What are you doin' here?

48
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:06,553
Uh,I'm sorry about the hour,but,
uh,it's just-- can I come in?

49
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,623
- Uh,no.
- No.

50
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:10,835
- No.
- No.

51
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,017
Um,I'll come out.

52
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:17,471
Look,uh,I-- I don't,uh,blame you.

53
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,680
I wouldn't really trust me either.

54
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:19,729
But you need to know this.

55
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:23,086
I had--well,I had my heart
broken,twice,as a matter of fact.

56
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,870
I mean,once when kate died,and then
another time after she was already dead,

57
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:28,457
I found out that she had an affair.

58
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,608
I'm sorry.I--I didn't know.

59
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:34,376
I'm much more sensitive to people's
hearts since my heart has been ripped out

60
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,420
and kicked around like a hacky sack.

61
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:39,095
And the fact of the matter is we
really had a good time last night.

62
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:40,034
Yeah,we did.I know--

63
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,140
'cause if you're in town for a week,
we should make a go of this thing,

64
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:43,705
I mean,go have lunch.What's lunch?

65
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:47,536
Nobody ever got hurt by a lunch,unless
of course there was a food-borne illness,

66
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,594
and-- why are we whispering,exactly?

67
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,069
You're not alone in there,are you?

68
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:52,915
No.

69
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,991
No.

70
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,449
But it's not what you're thinking.

71
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,729
Mom,who you talkin' to?

72
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,265
Just a friend,baby.You go back to sleep,ok?

73
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,138
"Mom"?

74
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:08,246
I usually detonate that bomb on
the third or fourth date,but yes.

75
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,130
I have a son.

76
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:13,353
His name is elliot.

77
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:18,268
And since I would have to bring him
to lunch tomorrow,you can flee now.

78
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,971
No.No,I'm not fleeing.

79
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,306
Oh,no.

80
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:24,512
You-- you should bring him to lunch with us.

81
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:27,405
I love kids.What kind of a guy doesn't like kids?

82
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,028
I hate kids!

83
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,790
Maybe "hate" is a strong word,but
I have a profound lack of understanding
for the need to breed.

84
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:38,018
Plus,all kids are just filled with snot.

85
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,371
So it's a nonstarter for you.

86
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,500
I just think single moms are dicey.

87
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,025
None taken.

88
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:44,904
What?

89
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:49,449
I was just hopin' you'd throw a "no offense"
my way,but guess I gave you too much credit.

90
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,871
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.But your son ned,he's different.

91
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,199
He's a-- he's a teen or
tween or whatever they're called.

92
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:54,874
Teen'll do.

93
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,620
He's a teen.

94
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,805
And look,he's interacting.

95
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,163
Cyclical conversation.

96
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:58,793
He's fine.

97
00:10:58,887 --> 00:10:59,827
He's self-sufficient.

98
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:04,895
Nina's son isn't going to be self-sufficient,and
he's gonna be a complete germ bag,for crying out loud.

99
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,751
Hey.You are a mom.

100
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:07,574
You could help me.

101
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,680
You--you can watch this kid while I go to lunch.

102
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:15,744
Oh,sorry,but I am taking my
son on a dicey single-mom lunch.

103
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,069
Let's go,ned.

104
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,557
- So what's the deal with that guy?
- You don't want to know.

105
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:21,572
Don't even look at me.

106
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,551
Hi,guys.

107
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,310
This is elliot.

108
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:32,852
El,it's professor payne.

109
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:33,769
Hello,young man.

110
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:34,595
How are you?

111
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,851
Hello,professor payne.

112
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,660
Please,call me,uh-- actually,
call me professor.That's good.

113
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:41,647
Hi.Elliot,I'm melinda.

114
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,248
Some people think dust is
mostly flakes from human skin.

115
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,151
Elliot.

116
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,478
A-actually dust is a lot of things.

117
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,764
Could be pet dander,pollen.

118
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:52,563
It could be soot.

119
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,368
Yeah,but its overall makeup
depends on where you live.

120
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,558
I think the human skin thing
was started to sell dust spray.

121
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,448
Are you an academician?

122
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,811
Oh,spare me.

123
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,761
Nobody but rick's that pretentious.

124
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:06,234
As a matter of fact,I am.

125
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,350
Why would you ask me that?

126
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,400
So's my dad.

127
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:13,202
You see,his,um,dad's
not really in the picture.

128
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,825
He's-- he's on an extended sabbatical in india.

129
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,873
They can't get text messages there.

130
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,625
Mind if i take a look at your victrola?

131
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:22,197
No.Go right ahead.

132
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:27,255
Uh,elliot,how old are you exactly?

133
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:28,534
Almost 10,sir.

134
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:29,714
That's a decade.

135
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,144
When's your birthday?

136
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:32,491
August 27.

137
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:33,581
I'm a virgo.

138
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,021
And we broke up in.

139
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,139
this isn't happening.

140
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,487
Maybe it's not what it seems.

141
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,638
Can I talk to you alone?

142
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:45,152
I just remembered we've got a,
uh,thing we're gonna be late for.

143
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:47,221
El,baby,come on.We gotta go.

144
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,253
Nice to meet you all.

145
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,290
Bye,guys.

146
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,146
there's no way I'm that kid's father,right?

147
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,391
Well,ignoring what she's
already told him about his dad,

148
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:06,226
the fact that he seems
to have your dna,math--

149
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,020
you're not helping.

150
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:07,716
You asked.

151
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,651
I know I asked.

152
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:10,437
You could always take a paternity test.

153
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,590
And confirm something
that I don't want to be true?

154
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,165
She hasn't exactly demanded one.

155
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,166
It's my own darn fault for chasing after her.

156
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,430
I--I didn't want kids when
I was married,let alone now.

157
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,877
Oh,neither do I,not yet anyway.

158
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,372
Why don't you want kids?

159
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,301
Do you mind me asking?

160
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,298
I do mind,actually,but I will answer.

161
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,142
It's your porch.

162
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,562
Kids are a huge responsibility,
and,uh,I'm selfish.

163
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,632
What's your excuse?

164
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,240
I'm afraid of juggling,you know,
the-- the feeding and the diapers
while dead people harass me.

165
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,349
You win.

166
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:44,976
I can't be a dad.

167
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,724
Look at me.I'm not father material.

168
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,427
I'm a miscreant of epic proportions.

169
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,359
Well,that's true.

170
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,325
All right.

171
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:52,724
Besides,we don't even know
if this is what nina wants.

172
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:54,009
Who knows what nina wants?

173
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,649
There's one way to find out.

174
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:57,464
I--you know what?

175
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,153
I hate talking to you.

176
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,430
I promote to a knight.

177
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:12,446
I found out I was pregnant after
you left,and I was so scared,ricky.

178
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,430
And I was gonna tell you,but you were.

179
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:18,018
already with kate,happy.

180
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:22,237
From the sounds of it,you've
all but told him I'm his dad.

181
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,238
No.I just kind of,you know,
dress it up a little.that way,

182
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:28,319
if he ever does find out,
it won't be such a shock to him.

183
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,571
Doesn't he have a right
to know who his father is?

184
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:31,828
It's complicated.

185
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:33,606
- Check.
- What again?

186
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:36,015
Oh,nice.

187
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:37,938
And he's mine.

188
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:39,603
He's brilliant.

189
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:40,941
He didn't get it from me.

190
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:42,541
Don't underestimate yourself.

191
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:46,826
I,uh-- I tried to enroll
him at archfield academy.

192
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,822
That's good.That's a good
school for pint-sized mensas.

193
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,143
Eh,it's not gonna happen

194
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:53,272
wait a minute.This kid could get into yale.

195
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:55,098
There's no way he didn't get accepted there.

196
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,844
Eh,he did.

197
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,376
It's just they-- they only
have 2 financial aid slots open.

198
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:04,721
He seems to be doin' ok at public school.

199
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,930
Public school?

200
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:06,887
Nina,no.

201
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,114
No,this kid's a genius.

202
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:11,803
You put him in public school,it's
like putting raw meat in a piranha tank.

203
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,749
They'll eat him alive.

204
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:13,935
You can't do that to him.

205
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:17,334
I don't sell enough
antidepressants to pay for it.

206
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:23,933
When kate died,I got a call
from my life insurance company.

207
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,545
Here's my wife of 8 years
dies in a freak accident.

208
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,423
Now they just wanna cut me a check.

209
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:29,536
I felt pretty awkward about it.

210
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,635
I didn't know what to do.
I never invested the money.

211
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,900
I just kept it in my savings account.

212
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:37,587
Bottom line is I'd like to use
that money to pay for elliot's school.

213
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:38,882
No.

214
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,375
Ricky,that's too generous.

215
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,250
Now,I didn't come here to ask you for money.

216
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,800
I didn't come here to ask you for anything.

217
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:47,727
I know that.

218
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,235
I'm pretty sure that's
what kate would have wanted.

219
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,631
You should move your pawn.

220
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:52,801
Don't count on it.

221
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,129
I don't need you to teach
me how to play chess,kid.

222
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:57,976
I'm just saying,if I were
you--I'd sacrifice my pawn.

223
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,131
Ah,he really is a chip
off the old payne,isn't he?

224
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,507
Alexander,you mind if I cut in?

225
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,533
This kid's too smart for me.

226
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:07,797
Well,don't blame it on him.

227
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,486
It's just his dna,I guess.

228
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,500
Unbelievable.

229
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,369
Do you mind if I finish his game?

230
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:20,562
Sure,professor,but you'll lose.

231
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,580
Whoa!

232
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,366
How 'bout you and i start from scratch?

233
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,102
Honey,I'm home.

234
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:56,955
Oh,how many times have I told you
about leavin' your shoes in the foyer,kate?

235
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:03,066
You know,kate,the scientist
in me is very intrigued,

236
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:08,517
but the human being in me has hair standing up in places
that I didn't even know that I had hair.

237
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,068
Come on,kate!

238
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,616
Is that the best you got?!

239
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:23,114
All right.

240
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:24,469
Getting better.

241
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:34,127
Oh,honey,that is such a textbook haunting.

242
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,363
A screw.

243
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:46,004
Are you tryin' to tell me something?

244
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:52,743
Ok,fine!

245
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,069
You wanna have this out!

246
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,728
Let's have it out right now!

247
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,990
You cheated on me with one of my colleagues!

248
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:02,193
So what right do you have to be mad at me?!

249
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:05,007
You think this is about infidelity?

250
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,728
What was that,honey?

251
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,668
I didn't quite hear you.

252
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,668
payne,where are you?

253
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:20,008
Here's something I never thought
I'd say-- I'm in here under the piano.

254
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:21,202
Oh,my.god

255
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:22,673
are you ok?

256
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,801
Well,not to be captain obvious,but not really.

257
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,097
There's an 800-pound baby grand on my back.

258
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,758
Can you feel anything?

259
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,511
Yes,jim,I can feel everything.

260
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,200
Thank you.

261
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,725
I'm gonna get the car jack.

262
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:37,639
I'm so sorry.

263
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:41,862
How's that?

264
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,726
Ahh.It only hurts when it hurts.

265
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,090
We're gonna have to get this x-rayed
and get you to the emergency room.

266
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:47,798
So you gonna tell me what happened?

267
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:48,769
Well,I was drunk.

268
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:49,515
I came home.

269
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,561
I decided to plow through my own
bookcase,swing from the chandelier,

270
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,712
and then me and the piano
rolled around on the floor-- all right.

271
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,935
I got in a fight with kate.

272
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,973
Yeah.She's obviously trying to tell you something.

273
00:18:58,997 --> 00:18:59,607
Right.

274
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,062
It's like ghost charades with props.

275
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:03,882
You know,she seemed pretty upset
the day that you met elliot.

276
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,793
Is there something you're not telling me?

277
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:11,027
Well,kate wanted kids,and so did i
for a brief,brief moment of insanity,

278
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:12,693
and we tried everything,all the fertility drugs.

279
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:16,095
It was killing kate that nothing was working,
and I told her,"don't worry about it.

280
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:20,449
I don't even want kids," but you know the way i have
that great talent for saying things the wrong way.

281
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,920
It just--it got ugly.

282
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,223
Now you have one,a kid.

283
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,387
And she doesn'T.

284
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:27,484
That hurt?

285
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,881
Ah,compared to being under a piano,it's ok.

286
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,937
Do you think that's why she's
upset,because of elliot?

287
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,151
Well,I think it's only gonna
get worse until she crosses over.

288
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,654
Well,look,I don't speak ghost,
and I don't do humility very well.

289
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,849
Would you please talk to her,mediate,whatever?

290
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:41,244
Yes.

291
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,926
- Hey.Please?
- Ok.

292
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,579
Just stop baiting her.

293
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,421
I will not bait her anymore.

294
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,251
What's that look?

295
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:51,733
Nothing.

296
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,711
- Hey.
- How is he?

297
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,297
Lucky.

298
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,386
His foot's pretty banged up,but,uh,

299
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,079
hairline fracture of the tibia,
\and he broke his little toe.

300
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,021
He'll be fine.

301
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:10,948
Look,uh.

302
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:15,677
I heard you two talking about how
much payne's wife wanted a kid.

303
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:18,192
- And I hate to bring this up again,but
- I'm so sorry.

304
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,988
Could you just hold that thought?

305
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,394
I always do.

306
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,007
Maternity Ward
Nursery
Labor & Delivery

307
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:43,325
You could have killed him.

308
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,026
I lost my temper.

309
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,602
He has that effect on me.

310
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,489
And anyway,I thought he
could stand to suffer a little.

311
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,917
Hasn't he done that already?

312
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,247
I mean,it's been 3 years,kate.

313
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:56,143
It's time for you to let him move on.

314
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,788
The way he's let me move on?

315
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:04,443
He told me you wanted a baby.

316
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,920
Oh,I know what he told you.

317
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:08,013
I'm a ghost,darling.

318
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,411
I can go places,hear things.

319
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,110
It's the only upside to an otherwise lousy state.

320
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,214
I'm sorry.I really need your help.

321
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:19,704
I was here first.

322
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:22,012
Sorry.

323
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,281
That happens all the time.

324
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,469
Look,obviously you're upset that he has a child.

325
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:30,633
- Ok,it doesn't seem fair,and I get that.
- Do you?

326
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,590
She shows up here with this boy and plays her
sad little violin about needing money to

327
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:41,013
get him into some special school,
and he's all too ready to just write her a check

328
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:43,665
for my life insurance money,no less.

329
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:46,529
Seems a bit sketchy to me.

330
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,476
So you think she's playing him.

331
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:50,672
You're a clever girl.

332
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,773
Figure it out.

333
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:15,177
Hey,you.

334
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,062
What happened?

335
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,450
Broke my vestigial appendage.

336
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,500
- I'm fine,though.Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

337
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:25,209
- Yeah,but just let me go first,ok?
- Ok.

338
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:26,507
All right.Um.

339
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,079
I thought about your offer to pay
for elliot's school,and.

340
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,152
I accept.

341
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:37,131
And then I--
I swear we'll go back to the city,

342
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:39,162
and you'll never hear from us again.

343
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:43,056
I've been thinkin' a lot about it,too,
and I don't wanna be a checkbook dad,nina.

344
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,697
So the offer's no good anymore?

345
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:46,445
No,the--the offer still stands.

346
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:49,398
I just wanna sw-sweeten the pot.

347
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:52,879
I-I've thought a lot about it,and that is,I-if I'm...

348
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,850
ok,if I'm going to be elliot's dad,

349
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,654
then I wanna be elliot's dad.

350
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,386
How would that work exactly?

351
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,641
Well,we could take it slow.

352
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,009
You don't have to tell him right away.

353
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,609
You guys can move in with me.

354
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:09,111
Oh,r-ricky,wait.Slow down.

355
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,058
No,uh,it's not-- you know.

356
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,254
I have lots of space,lots of space,

357
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:16,098
and you and I,we don't have to
be this instant couple right away.

358
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,448
We don't even have to be a couple at all,
even,you know,but,um,

359
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,042
there's a great satellite school that the
college offers for gifted children.

360
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:27,007
We could enroll elliot there and--
I just--I don't know.

361
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:27,835
I think I'm ready.

362
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:30,041
I'm really ready to be a dad.

363
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:31,978
At least,I'm ready to give it a try.

364
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,620
So,uh,how is this all goin' over at home?

365
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,700
Well,you can tell that jim wants to talk about it.

366
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:40,795
I keep sidestepping.

367
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,173
I mean,what's the big rush,right?

368
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:46,392
There's gotta be some huge compromise
somewhere between forever and right now.

369
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,772
Yeah,except for men pretty much have forever,
and women don'T.

370
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:51,098
I'm still young.

371
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,949
ish...Ok?There's plenty of time.

372
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:54,759
Besides,I have to cross kate over,

373
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,051
and I can't do that until I find out
if nina's telling the truth,

374
00:23:57,078 --> 00:24:00,298
which means you should stop changing the subject.

375
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,462
You know,you could always get that P.I.
you hired to help you out.

376
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:06,213
And distract him from getting me
more information on my dad?

377
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:06,793
I don't think so.

378
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,167
You know what I really need to do is
just yank a hair right out of payne's head

379
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:11,951
and then do my own paternity test.

380
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:16,153
You know,as much fun as that sounds,
I have a simpler idea.

381
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,574
Ready?

382
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:23,487
Hello.Yes,

383
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:28,415
is principal stickley available for dean
julia marlowe from the archfield academy?

384
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,185
It's regarding elliot haley.

385
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:32,944
I'll hold.

386
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:36,102
This sleuthing stuff is kinda fun.

387
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,574
You're oddly good at it.

388
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:42,047
Yes.One moment,please,for dean marlow.

389
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,466
Hello.Principal stickley.

390
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:50,585
Yes,we did receive elliot's application,
but the birth certificate,though,

391
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:53,907
I-it was a fax of a fax,
and so you know how that goes.

392
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,790
We really need to get the father's name.

393
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,435
Pen.

394
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:00,912
Yes.

395
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,926
Thank you so much for your trouble.

396
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:09,482
Damn.

397
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:18,423
I think you're just beating yourself up
over an accident.

398
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:23,645
Your time here earthbound,
it's about your redemption.

399
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,498
You did that.

400
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:26,991
You made that sacrifice.

401
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,547
But is it that simple?

402
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,863
It is if you can see the light.

403
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:36,621
Yeah.

404
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,767
Yeah,it's-- it's on the other side of that car.

405
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,070
What do I do?

406
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,535
Go into it.

407
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,891
Sort things out on the other side.

408
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:09,508
- Another one.
- Yep.

409
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,023
Just a random ghost.

410
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,870
Sometimes I wish they'd just leave me alone.

411
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,296
Yeah,you and me both.

412
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,571
So what am I gonna do?

413
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:21,084
I mean,am I gonna talk to rick,am I gonna confront nina,
or am I gonna just move to canada?

414
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,389
You'll figure it out.You always do.

415
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,676
That was really helpful.Thanks.

416
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:28,045
You want my real opinion?

417
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,010
I feel like you should tell rick first.

418
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:30,925
Why?

419
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:34,797
'Cause you guys have so much in common,
I think he'll be relieved that the kid is not his.

420
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,150
So that's why you're being distant.

421
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,346
We've talked about this.

422
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,889
Yeah,I know.We've talked,and we've talked,

423
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,137
and,melinda,I gotta say sometimes

424
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:45,951
I feel like you use your gift as an excuse
and that you care more about the dead than--

425
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,602
that is not fair,ok?

426
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,687
I'm just not ready to have a baby.

427
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,384
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever will.

428
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,870
I mean,we've been married 3 years.

429
00:26:52,882 --> 00:26:54,222
Yeah,and we're still young.

430
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:55,669
Yeah.

431
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:58,144
So were payne and kate.

432
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,840
Look what happened to them.

433
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,908
- I gotta go to work.
- Yep.

434
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,231
Let me know how it goes with carl.

435
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:17,664
Have to tell you up front,melinda,
your father left a pretty cold trail.

436
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,077
Since 1989?

437
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:23,551
Uh,'91,2 years after you said
he left you and your mother for good.

438
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,975
Drained his bank account.Cashed out his ira.

439
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,383
Went back to the woman in colorado he had a son with.

440
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,671
Gabriel,my half-brother.

441
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:35,306
Other than that,the only record I have of him
is workin' as a short-order cook at a debby's in arizona.

442
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,020
What?

443
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:40,348
I mean,my dad was a lawyer.
That doesn't make any sense.

444
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:42,215
It does if he was on the run from somethin'.

445
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,380
The run from what?

446
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:50,079
Melinda,when you first asked me to look into this,
you told me your father was dead.

447
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:52,016
You were pretty certain of that.

448
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,426
Yeah.I guess I have...

449
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:59,674
been telling myself that for so long
that I started to believe it.

450
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,697
There's no record of his death?

451
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:03,662
Not that I could find.

452
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:05,635
No burial.No cremation.

453
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:09,762
The list of john does in this country's huge,
and without dental records or dna,

454
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:12,973
it's a needle in a haystack.

455
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,192
Look,I have some other leads,but--heh.

456
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,275
I'm startin' to feel guilty takin' your money.

457
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,623
You found out more than I ever could.

458
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:23,842
Well,it's your call.

459
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:26,375
Just don't give up,please.

460
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:28,234
I really need to know.

461
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:38,547
So I guess the final question is just do
I make the check out to archfield academy,

462
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:42,139
or,I mean,I could make the check out to
the school that's here in grandview.

463
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,389
I'm not tryin' to force a decision.

464
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:43,983
I know.

465
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:46,955
I'm just gonna need to take some time
to think about it,so.

466
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,506
maybe if you just make the check out to me,
I can put it into elliot's school fund.

467
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:53,895
That way,I can prove I can afford
whichever school he applies to.

468
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,135
What are these,professor?

469
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,589
Those are my fetishes.

470
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,655
Ricky?

471
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,750
He's 10.

472
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:00,452
I know he's 10.

473
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,855
That's actually what they're called.

474
00:29:02,902 --> 00:29:03,952
They're called fetishes.

475
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:07,144
They're carvings from an ancient
zuni tribe from new mexico.

476
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,734
They carve each animal,

477
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,939
and they think that there's a spirit inside them,
giving each one a very specific power.

478
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,911
Why don't you pick one up and give it a try?

479
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,440
Ah.The wily fox.

480
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,095
He keeps his owner safe.

481
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,040
What you do is you put his nostrils in your mouth--

482
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,659
Inhales And you inhale.

483
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,234
Go ahead.Give it a try.

484
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,068
No,thanks.It's still flu season.

485
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:29,979
Hi,everyone.

486
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:31,976
Hey.

487
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:33,599
Actually,I'm here to see nina.

488
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,255
- You are?\n- Yeah.

489
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:42,999
Who's brian dobbs?

490
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:44,765
Who?

491
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:47,217
He was on the birth certificate as the father.

492
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,515
- How did you f
- I made a phone call.

493
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:51,783
And I can make some more.Yeah.Do I need to?

494
00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:55,142
- It's not what you think.
- It's exactly what I think.

495
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,739
The question is are you gonna tell payne,or am I?

496
00:29:58,648 --> 00:29:59,488
Hey.

497
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:02,393
- Sorry I'm late.
- No.Right on time.

498
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:05,522
Technically I should have them stored in cornmeal.

499
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,639
That's what they eat,and the more they eat,
the better they are,and the more power they have.

500
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:11,948
Uh,nina said that is was ok for delia
to take elliot for some ice cream.

501
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:14,539
Ok.What's going on?

502
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,710
Come on.

503
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:17,923
We'll be in the cafeteria.

504
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:21,715
Brian dobbs?

505
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:25,107
The guy that used to hang out in the
laundry room of our building,brian dobbs?

506
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,557
Anyway,he was nice to me.

507
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:30,844
After you started hangin' out with kate,
I saw the writing on the wall.

508
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,736
So he took advantage of you.

509
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:36,121
After you left,I found out I was 3 months pregnant.

510
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:39,761
When I told brian,he demanded I take a paternity test.

511
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,473
Kind of backfired on him.

512
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,582
He hung around for about a year.

513
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:48,774
Then he split.

514
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:50,089
Then what happened?

515
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:52,903
Bastard stole my social security number.

516
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:56,254
All of a sudden,I've got all these--
these credit card bills piling up.

517
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,691
I find out he's drained my savings account,

518
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,288
and I haven't heard from him since.

519
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:07,651
He left me with a one-year-
old and buried under a mountain of debt,

520
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,885
and I've been killin' myself,
tryin' to pay it off for years,

521
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,985
and now it's gonna cost my son his school.

522
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:16,205
I've never done anything like this before.

523
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:19,897
Why me?

524
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:21,833
Why'd you start with me?

525
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:27,263
I just thought the rick payne I remembered would.

526
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:30,185
give me money to make the problem go away.

527
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:35,395
I never in a million years thought
you'd want to be in elliot's life.

528
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,790
So I'm sorry for what I did.

529
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:43,774
Mostly I'm sorry I underestimated you.

530
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,314
Well,you're not half as sorry as I am.

531
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:50,317
I think you should go.

532
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,297
Yeah.I think you should go.

533
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:13,798
Kate.

534
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:16,242
Are you here?'Cause he really wants to talk to you.

535
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,131
Spooky.Is that it?

536
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:25,404
I bet you feel really stupid now that
it turns out the kid isn't even mine,don't you,honey?

537
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:27,758
Ask him how he thinks it makes me feel to watch him,

538
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,685
a man who told me flat out he
didn't want to have children with me,

539
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:35,203
become completely and utterly destroyed
over some kid who wasn't even his to begin with.

540
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,260
She's a little angry at how upset you were
when you found out that elliot wasn't yours.

541
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,545
What's that got to do with us?

542
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,299
I'll tell you exactly what that's got to do with us,
you miserable little.

543
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,733
I will not repeat that,and,you,calm down.

544
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:52,134
Why?What happened?What did she say?

545
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,029
She's angry.

546
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,982
because she thinks you didn't want a baby with her.

547
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,192
Wow.She thinks I didn't wanna have kids with her?

548
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:05,008
Kate,I--that's not what I said at all.

549
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,545
- Yes,you did,repeatedly.
- And I never once made this about you or about me,

550
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:09,703
- and you wanna think that I'm selfish.
- "One more year.

551
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,820
We have so much time,and look what that got--" .

552
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,996
child,elliot,and you wanna think that you're suffering.

553
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,213
- I'm the one that's suffering.
- You have no idea how much.

554
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,729
You don't even know the damn truth!

555
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:19,034
All right,enough!

556
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:20,691
She started it.

557
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:25,393
I didn't get any of that,nor did I want to,
but I did hear you say something about him not knowing the truth.

558
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,251
When we were trying to...

559
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:33,411
when I thought he wanted children as much as I did.

560
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:39,746
we were doing in vitro,fertility injections,and.

561
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:43,195
were you gonna tell me,rick?

562
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,091
I need a little more here.

563
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:46,759
The dean called.

564
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,833
Your grant's been approved.

565
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,242
2 years in peru when we're
trying to get pregnant,

566
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,491
and you didn't tell me.

567
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,588
Move over.

568
00:33:57,964 --> 00:33:58,984
Come on.

569
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:08,505
Look,I am nowhere near ready
to have a child now,ok?

570
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:09,996
But we've very young.

571
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,900
We have lots of time.We have
all the time in the world,so...

572
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:15,101
it's ok.

573
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,362
Professor payne.

574
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,640
Sure.

575
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:30,172
It's the fertility clinic.

576
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:33,898
I know all this.

577
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:34,632
They called.

578
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:38,214
They said her eggs were not viable,
and she accused me of being relieved.

579
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:40,524
We fought.Blah,blah,blah.

580
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,421
I lied.

581
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,787
The doctor said we were good to go.

582
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:47,286
That was my one chance to get pregnant,

583
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:49,832
but because I knew he didn't want it.

584
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:52,983
I lied.

585
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,601
Few weeks later,I was dead.

586
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,451
What is it?

587
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,218
She lied.

588
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:04,674
She lied to you because she thought
you didn't want children.

589
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,114
The doctor said it was a good time.

590
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,578
She thought it was her only chance.

591
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,459
I didn't know.

592
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:14,556
If she lied,why is she mad at me?

593
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:19,513
I'm angry because you knew I wanted children.

594
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:21,008
and you said you wanted that,too.

595
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:25,123
Then every time I brought it up,
you just pushed me away.

596
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,476
But that didn't make it stop.

597
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:29,712
Even now,it.

598
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:39,756
I know it's not possible,so why
does the ache only get worse?

599
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,710
It hurts so much.

600
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,694
How can you make that go away?

601
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,421
I can'T.

602
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:56,293
But you have to move on now.

603
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:57,488
I mean,you know that.

604
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:59,382
You know I can'T.

605
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,367
Kate,please don't go.

606
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:08,652
oh,my god.

607
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:09,935
What is it?

608
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:14,592
Well,kate told me about her death,
but listen to this old article.

609
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,673
"A construction crane plummeted 8 stories "

610
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,329
at a brookside office complex
late yesterday morning,

611
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:22,457
"crushing to death a motorist
who was making a u-turn,

612
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,730
"the victim later identified as katherine payne.

613
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:28,476
Payne died moments before her body was freed.

614
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,436
" That is awful.

615
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,710
How random.

616
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:33,485
Just making a u-turn.

617
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:38,281
Hi.

618
00:36:38,836 --> 00:36:40,936
I'm sorry just to show up like this.

619
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:42,591
- No.No.
- No.

620
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,106
What's goin' on?

621
00:36:44,592 --> 00:36:45,622
Go on.

622
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:51,918
I took this from professor payne.

623
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:56,755
My mom wants you to give it
back to him for me and.

624
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,779
tell him I'm sorry.

625
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,971
Look,I may not be the world's best role model,

626
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,898
but I'm trying to raise an honest kid here.

627
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:08,291
No.You know what?

628
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:13,287
maybe you should do this yourself in person.

629
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:17,822
Pretty sure ricky never wants to see me again.

630
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:20,073
I think you might be surprised.

631
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:25,903
Are you crazy?

632
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,906
I told you I never wanna see her again.

633
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:30,462
That's why I put you in a moving
car before I told you.

634
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,140
Why don't you just waterboard me instead?

635
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:33,645
Wait a minute.

636
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,740
This is where kate died.

637
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:35,473
I hate this place.

638
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:36,685
Why would you bring me here?

639
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,298
Trying to kill 2 birds with one ghost.Come on.

640
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,150
Well,thanks.

641
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:44,568
What is it?

642
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:47,694
The fox fetish is in there.

643
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:51,013
I took good care of him just like you said.

644
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,772
You took it from me without asking?

645
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,189
Yeah.

646
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,804
I'm...I'm sorry.

647
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,944
I just thought it'd keep my mom and me safe.

648
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:05,991
Ok.

649
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,287
I thought you'd be here.

650
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,455
Seems like I'm always here.

651
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,612
There's this constant pull.

652
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,789
I...it's because this is
where your time was cut short.

653
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:22,821
You know,I don't normally
reward thievery,young man,

654
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,066
but I'm gonna make an exception.

655
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,863
I want you to do me a favor,elliot.

656
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:29,129
I want you to take this box,

657
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:31,125
and I want you to keep it,

658
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:32,291
because that way,

659
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:36,845
you'll always know that somebody's lookin'
out for you and your mommy,ok?

660
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:47,898
- Damn him.
- All right.

661
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,412
Listen,go,uh...

662
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,359
why don't you go wait in the car or somethin'.

663
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:54,045
I have to talk to your mom,ok?

664
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:56,171
Thank you,professor.

665
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:06,102
Well,if I felt stupid before,
I really feel stupid now.

666
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,878
He really got accepted to archfield academy?

667
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:10,014
Yeah.

668
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,938
Yeah.That much is true.

669
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:12,913
That's good.

670
00:39:12,966 --> 00:39:13,566
That's good.

671
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,768
I'm proud of him,and I'm still paying for it.

672
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:17,545
You don't have to do that,ricky.

673
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,700
I know.That's why I'm doing it.

674
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:23,091
And for the record,after that first night,

675
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:24,567
I wasn't gonna go through with it,

676
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:28,092
but then you just surprised me.

677
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:31,895
And I started wishing it was true.

678
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:34,393
My grandma used to say,"wish again,

679
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,290
'cause you got bad luck on that last one.

680
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,287
There's another reason why
you keep getting dra here.

681
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:56,008
Wn I think it's what you're really mad about.

682
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:58,856
You wanted more time,and you were mad at him,

683
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:01,744
because he always promised
that there would be more.

684
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:04,956
It's not his fault.

685
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:09,165
Well,I don't have to guess who
you're talking to,do I?

686
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:10,595
Hello,kate.

687
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:12,991
Hi.

688
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:14,887
She says hi.

689
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:17,442
I don't want you to be mad at me,but I...

690
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:20,249
I can't stand the thought of that little
boy not getting what he needs,

691
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:22,068
whether he's my son or not.

692
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:24,595
She doesn't seem angry.

693
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:29,215
I'm sorry the guy I was
didn't wanna have kids.

694
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:31,255
It's 'cause I was selfish.

695
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,190
I just wanted you all for myself.

696
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:40,928
Think I needed to believe that
elliot was my son,because.

697
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:45,304
I don't have you anymore.

698
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,814
I'm sorry I didn't forgive you.

699
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:53,892
I forgive you.

700
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:58,199
But I couldn't before,because
I wasn't ready to let you go.

701
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,208
Oh,crap.

702
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:05,165
- You see it,don't you?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,733
It's magnificent.

704
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:12,062
Tell him I said I still love him.

705
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:17,429
and I think he'll make a
wonderful father someday.

706
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:20,021
I promise.

707
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,641
Good-bye,rick.

708
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:34,027
Tell him he should put his
ring in the sock drawer.

709
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:36,609
That way,when he opens it,

710
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,079
he'll think of me every now and again.

711
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,483
Hey,mel.I'm home.

712
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,240
You've got the.wedding china out.What's,uh...

713
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,974
what's the occasion?

714
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:23,489
Just celebrating life.

715
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:24,936
That's all.

716
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,510
Look,I'm sorry about today.

717
00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:28,526
I...I'm not mad if that's

718
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:29,321
- what this is about.
- No.

719
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,624
It's not,not at all.I...

720
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:37,122
was just thinking about
what you said,and you're right.

721
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:38,697
I mean.

722
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:41,422
we never know what's gonna happen.

723
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:43,875
Wait a minute.

724
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:47,267
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

725
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,095
Let's have a baby.

726
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:58,806
Uh,look,don't do this just for me.

727
00:42:58,821 --> 00:42:59,411
- I'm...
- no.

728
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:00,524
It's for us.

729
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:01,727
Life is too short.

730
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,440
You know?What the hell are we waiting for?

731
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:08,355
Oh,god,I love you.

732
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,920
I love you.

733
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:16,331
Don't answer it.

734
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:18,145
Oh,no.It's carl.

735
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:18,920
I told him to come by.

736
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:20,372
- He wanted to
- ok.

737
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,687
- All right.I'm
-all right.

738
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,351
Look,I'm gonna go in the shower.

739
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:25,295
Hold this whole.

740
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:28,808
- hey.
- Hi.

741
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:30,702
Uh,look,I'm sorry.

742
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,238
This is it,everything
I could find on your father,

743
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:35,264
which isn't much.

744
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:38,254
Sorry I couldn't find more.

745
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,008
Are you ok?

746
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:50,854
Um,sorry.

747
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:52,028
It's chilly tonight.

748
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:53,331
Here.

749
00:43:56,484 --> 00:43:58,804
What are these numbers?

750
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:00,491
I don't know.Must have pulled an old file folder.

751
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:01,626
It's not my handwriting.

752
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,240
Carl,I just saw you write them down.

753
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:07,548
I'm sorry,mel.I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

754
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:10,942
Good night.

755
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:14,525
Good night.

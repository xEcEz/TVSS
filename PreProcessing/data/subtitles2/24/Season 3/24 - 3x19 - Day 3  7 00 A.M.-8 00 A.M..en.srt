1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,799
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,199
Tony, its me. We have a problem.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,800
We just determined a man who was
exposed to the virus got out of the hotel

4
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,499
Son of a bitch. Howd that happen?

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,100
He must have slipped out right
before we reinforced the perimeter.

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,099
Its likely he had no idea had been exposed.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,100
If we dont find this guy before he becomes
symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak.

8
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,299
What do you want?

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,599
To give you your next assignment.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,000
There is a man named Ryan Chappelle,
regional director of CTU.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,299
I want him killed.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,800
This man Saunders has proven that
he will use this virus

13
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,300
to inflict mass casualties if you
dont do what he says.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
How long am I supposed to let
him hold this country hostage?

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,699
Until we catch him.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,100
Saunders called in with another demand.

17
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:50,200
What does he want now?

18
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,299
He wants you killed.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,600
Hes threatened to release the virus into the main
population unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m.

20
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,899
My god, jack

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,900
He has proven he will use the virus.
The president didn't have a choice.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,499
Ryan, I think we found Saunders.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
45 minutes ago he made a call from an
apartment not far from here.

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,500
Chase is leading a strike
team over there now.

25
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:14,500
Good, Jack.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,899
No one is here.

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,399
Saunders, why are you doing this?

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Even if I told you,
you wouldnt understand.

29
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,499
A van will be arriving shortly.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,450
Leave Chappelles body with the driver.

31
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,400
I am sorry, Ryan, we got to do this.

32
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,499
Get on your knees.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,400
I am sorry we let you down, Ryan.

34
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:40,400
God forgive me.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,600
The following takes place
between 7:00 am and 8:00 am.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,600
He is clean. There is no tracker.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,800
If you try to follow us,
Saunders will release the virus.

38
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,799
Wayne Palmer.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,999
This is Jack Bauer

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,900
Chappelles body has just been
picked up by Saunders' people.

41
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,900
Thanks Jack.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Ryan Chappelle is dead

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I ordered the death of one of
our agents, one of our finest.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,099
As unthinkable as that was,

45
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,050
I had to buy some time in order
to protect civilian lives.

46
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:36,000
I will not cave in to any more
of this terrorists demands.

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,900
David, unfortunately we are vulnerable as long as
Saunders has his virus and is willing to release it.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,200
So far, over 700 people have been
infected, and they're all gonna die.

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,300
Now, unless you are willing to accept more
loss of life, I dont know what else we can do.

50
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:59,300
He has us in a corner, David.

51
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,100
Convene the Cabinet.

52
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:14,100
Yes sir.

53
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,699
What did you find?

54
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,099
We worked up the money trails
that Chappelle had on his system.

55
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Stephen Saunders has been sending
$10000 a month to his daughter Jane.

56
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:30,999
He has a daughter?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,999
Yes. Right here on the screen.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
She is 19, she lives in Santa Barbara.
She goes to school there.

59
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,899
All right, find out where she is now.

60
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Call Santa Barbara PD (Police Department),
make sure they are on standby.

61
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,399
Almeida.

62
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,899
Tony, its Jack.

63
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,150
Jack, what happened?

64
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,399
Chappelle is dead.

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,599
Saunders people picked up his body.

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,899
4 men all wearing hoods,
black van, no plates.

67
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
All right, look,
I will see if we can SAT track it.

68
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,099
I already put Adam on it.

69
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,400
Do we have any idea why
Saunders wanted Chappelle dead yet?

70
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,599
I was just about to call you.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,200
We found a thread that Chappelle
was working up on his own.

72
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,400
Looks like Saunders has a daughter.

73
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,299
A daughter?

74
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,400
Yeah, the money trail Chappelle
was following leads to a Jane Saunders.

75
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:16,399
What do we know about her?

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,699
We are still digging up information.

77
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,800
We know she is 19 years old,
she goes to school in Santa Barbara.

78
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,099
Is she still there?

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,700
Yeah. I was just about to call the Santa
Barbara office to have her picked up.

80
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,200
Wait, Tony, Tony, dont.
Thats not the right play.

81
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:28,899
Why not?

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,799
Think about it.

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,899
We dont know anything about this girl.

84
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,799
We dont know if she even
knows who her father really is.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
And obviously Saunders is going to
everything he can to protect his daughter.

86
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,099
So someone is watching her.

87
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,199
If you want to grab her for questioning,

88
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,399
you are going to have to do
it without him knowing.

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,900
Which means we have to conduct a plain sight
swap, switch her out with one of our own agents.

90
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:46,299
Jack, I dont know that we have the time.

91
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
We are going to have to find an agent that
looks like the girl within the next half hour.

92
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,099
Right now Saunders is calling all the shots.

93
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,200
If we dont do something soon,
we are going to be completely paralyzed.

94
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:58,799
All right, I will get started.

95
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,699
Chloe, we need to find a
Jan Saunders look alike.

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,500
I need you to abstract a physical description cross
referencing with our CTU agents in regions 2 and 3.

97
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,600
Ok, when do you need it?

98
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,599
Right now.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,800
I just started the file on her.

100
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,000
Chloe, just do it for me, please.

101
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Dessler.

102
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:19,899
Hey, its me.

103
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,599
Did you get the test results?

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,100
I wont know if I am infected
for another hour.

105
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,299
Whats taking so long?

106
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,899
They couldnt interpret the result here.

107
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,800
They had to send everything back to the lab.

108
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,950
How are you feeling?

109
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:38,100
I am, I think I am ok.

110
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:39,699
No nose bleeds?

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,000
Nothing on your skin?

112
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,699
No.

113
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,600
Look, NHS has everything under control here.

114
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:47,900
I want to keep busy.

115
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,799
How can I help?

116
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,299
Adam is working on a citywide containment.

117
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,900
I will have him split off some
of his workload on your system.

118
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:01,000
Open a socket, you can help
with NHS deployment.

119
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,300
I will call you later, ok?

120
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:09,300
Yeah, ok.

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,399
Michelle is still at the hotel.

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
I just told her youd send over some of
your system updates for her to work on.

123
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,599
Ok, I will send them right over.

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,050
Where are we on this guy who
escaped from the hotel?

125
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,499
His name is Bill Cole, he is
an insurance sales rep.

126
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,199
We contacted his wife by phone,
but she wasnt being very cooperative.

127
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,000
We did manage to get from her that Cole
came home unusually late and left early.

128
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:34,999
For work?

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Probably, but his office
doesnt open for another half hour,

130
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,399
so we are looking for him now.

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,300
NHS has just arrived and they will
quarantine the house and test the wife.

132
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,250
Who are we sending over there?

133
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:50,199
Chase. He will be there soon.

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Agent Bauer,
I have the President for you.

135
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:53,600
Patch him through.

136
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,499
Jack

137
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,499
Mr. President

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Stephen Saunders, the man who is in
control of the virus, you know him, correct?

139
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:03,100
Yes sir. I worked with him a number of
years ago on a mission that you sanctioned.

140
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:05,099
The Drazen mission in Kosovo.

141
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,600
The last conversation I had with him,
he said there would be other demands.

142
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,400
His exact words: the main event to come.

143
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:15,200
You have any idea what he means by that?

144
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,599
I wish I could tell you, sir.

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,099
Right now Stephen Saunders is
in a vengeful state of mind.

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,000
Any demands that he makes will
be detrimental to American security.

147
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:29,000
What I am asking, Jack,
is what will he do if I say no to him?

148
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Mr. President, when I worked with Stephen Saunders,
I never thought he was capable of mass murder.

149
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,600
Today we know he is.

150
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,399
He still has the virus.

151
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,400
If you dont meet his demands, sir, I
believe that he will continue to release it.

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,650
Thank you, Jack.

153
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,800
Yes, Mr. President.

154
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Here is the list you wanted of the top ten
agents that could double as Jane Saunders.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,499
None of these are in Los Angeles.

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,950
I know. The closest is CTU San Francisco.

157
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,400
Did you put together a 2nd tier list?

158
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah.

159
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,499
You sure this is right?

160
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah, I double checked when
I saw the results.

161
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,499
Kim Bauer.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, Kim, could you come up
to my office, please

163
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,550
Sure.

164
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,599
Thanks.

165
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
You are not thinking of using her?

166
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:41,999
We dont have a choice.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,399
Shouldnt you talk to Jack first?

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Chloe, I will take care of it,
all right? Thank you.

169
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,300
Why dont you sit down.

170
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:01,099
Ok.

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Kim, we need to question Jane Saunders
without her father knowing about it.

172
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,400
The problem is, we are pretty
sure he has somebody watching her.

173
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,699
Fine. What do you need me to do?

174
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,799
Well, you are the same age,
similar body types,

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,700
your facial fertures are different, but no so
different that we couldnt disguise it from a distance.

176
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,599
You want me to pose as Jan Saunders.

177
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Well, we have better matches, but
they are too far away from this office.

178
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:31,400
So, the bottom line is,
you are our best chance.

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,599
Now, we dont have much time.

180
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,099
We are still in the early
stages of planning this mission,

181
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,100
but if all goes according to plan,
it shouldnt be too dangerous.

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,850
No, I am not going to
order you to do this.

183
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,899
I know, and I know whats
been going on today.

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,800
And if you had a better option,
I know youd take it

185
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:55,900
So, I am fine and I will do it.

186
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,939
You sure?

187
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,977
Positive

188
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,600
Chloe, I am leaving for
Santa Barbara in a few minutes,

189
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,702
so you are going to need to transfer
all my stuff onto your system.

190
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,803
I know everything thats happening,
I already pulled your data.

191
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,003
Good.

192
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:28,705
I think its only fair that I tell you.
I told Tony I didnt think you should do this.

193
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,906
Field work isnt learn as you go.

194
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,908
I am not doing this to be a field agent,
Chloe, there is no one else.

195
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,308
Yeah, thats why I didnt fight Tony harder.

196
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:37,609
Not that he would listen to me anyway.

197
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,411
I am not so out of it that I dont know he
doesnt respect my opinions on tactical matters.

198
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,312
Ok, look, I have to go.

199
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:48,215
Ok, I just wanted to let you know how I felt,
and I want you to know that I am behind 110%

200
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,315
I really hope nothing bad happens to you.

201
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,917
Listen, Chloe, are you coordinating
this operation from inside?

202
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:54,717
Of course.

203
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:59,620
Ok, maybe you should start prepping, because I bet there
is about 2 dozen agents still waiting for comm. Codes.

204
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:04,122
I like your energy, Kim. Use it.

205
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:07,924
Adam, could you send me a list of all the
personnel working on the Jan Saunders operation?

206
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:10,026
I cant do it right now, Chloe,
I am monitoring Chase.

207
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,225
Did he find Bill Cole?

208
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,927
Not yet, he is interrogating Coles wife.

209
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,628
This thing is out of control.

210
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,430
I already told the people on
the phone that Bill isnt here.

211
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,930
I know, I know,

212
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,431
but when he was here,

213
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:25,183
did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?

214
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,934
Was he bleeding from
the nose for instance?

215
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,734
No, not that I saw.

216
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,236
What about rashes, skin irritation,
anything of that sort?

217
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,336
No. Why would you think that hed be sick?

218
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:37,438
He came in contact with some people who
are sick at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

219
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,340
When was he at the Chandler Plaza?

220
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,240
Earlier this morning.

221
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,241
No, no, he wasnt.

222
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:49,244
He was with a client at the office.

223
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:54,447
He did it again, didnt he?

224
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,448
That bastard did it again.

225
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,449
Maam

226
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,252
Then I hope he did get something.

227
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,652
I hope that he dies.

228
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:07,152
Please, Mrs. Cole, I need you

229
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:08,753
Get out of here. Get out of my way.

230
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:09,854
Mrs. Cole

231
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:10,454
Get out of my way

232
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:15,357
Mrs. Cole, you need to stay calm,
because I cant let you leave.

233
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,357
Agent Edmunds

234
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,858
Yeah

235
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:22,161
One of my men just found this.

236
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:22,960
Where?

237
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,561
Wastebasket in the bathroom.

238
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,763
Blood is tacky, which means its fresh.

239
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,063
Then Bill Cole is symptomatic.

240
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:28,763
Yeah.

241
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:32,265
I need you to contact every urgent
care facility in a 30 mile radius.

242
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:37,268
Yes sir.

243
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,768
Excuse me.

244
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,169
I have had a nose bleed
for about an hour.

245
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,270
I cant seem to stop it.

246
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,321
Did you put ice on it?

247
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:44,371
Yeah. Didnt do anything.

248
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:46,171
Try an ER, get it cauterized.

249
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,872
That will take too long.
I got to go to work.

250
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,674
We dont have anything here
that will stop that.

251
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,176
All right. Thanks.

252
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:56,777
Excuse me.

253
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:58,879
The swap will take place at
the campus library.

254
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,278
She works there in the mornings.

255
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,680
This is a file of
relevant personal data.

256
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:07,682
All right.

257
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,983
Chloe, where is Tony?

258
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:12,484
He is in the teleconference
room with Kim.

259
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:13,785
Why isn¡¯t she working the
satellite track with you?

260
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:18,788
Uh, you might want to
talk to Tony about that.

261
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,490
When you get into the position,
just act naturally

262
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,791
Try to look up a place.

263
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:25,591
Hey, Jack.

264
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,991
What are you doing with Kim?

265
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,693
Chloe came over a list of
potential matches for Jan Sanders.

266
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,293
Good, so we have got one?

267
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:34,095
Well, you are not going to like it.

268
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:39,098
It¡¯s Kim.

269
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:40,898
My Kim?

270
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,599
I am not crazy about it either,

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,101
but she is the only one that matched
both physically and geographically.

272
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,501
You are not sending her into the field.

273
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,003
She can handle it,
plus she has a safety net.

274
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,603
Find someone else, Tony.

275
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,605
Jack, you said yourself, we need to get
Saunder¡¯s daughter without him knowing.

276
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,406
Kim is our best shot at doing that.

277
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:57,706
She is not doing it.

278
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:02,709
It¡¯s not up to you, it¡¯s her decision.

279
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,109
Fine.

280
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,112
I will order her not to do it.

281
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:10,513
She doesn¡¯t work for you, Jack

282
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:15,515
She works for me

283
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:21,618
Don¡¯t...

284
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,118
Dad

285
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,419
Get out of here.

286
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,820
Please don¡¯t do this, please

287
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,020
Get out of here now.

288
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:28,322
Or I will throw you out myself. Move

289
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:31,223
Jack

290
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,324
You talk it over with your father.

291
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,025
If we have to abort this,
I want to know now.

292
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:40,027
I will be outside.

293
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,129
I know you think you are doing the right
thing, but this is not going to happen.

294
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,229
Somebody has to do it.

295
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,530
Someone will, not you

296
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,630
I am the best match

297
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,031
You are not a field operative

298
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,032
I have weapons training.
This is decoy work.

299
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,033
Saunders¡¯ people won¡¯t
even come close to me.

300
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:53,433
Kim, you don¡¯t know what
you are talking about.

301
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:57,135
If everything was to go right in this scenario,
which is not a chance I am willing to take

302
00:16:57,136 --> 00:17:01,237
You are not taking it, I am

303
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,338
The reason why you have got this job,

304
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,341
the reason why I gave you this job is
so that I an make sure you¡¯d be safe.

305
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:12,243
I took this job because I wanted it,

306
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:17,246
not because you wanted me here.

307
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:21,898
I know that this is hard for you,

308
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,349
but this is not your decision.

309
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,352
This is my job, better yet, my duty.

310
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:36,755
I am going to be safe,

311
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:41,578
but I am doing it.

312
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,899
They are ready to go

313
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,998
All set

314
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,698
Ok, now as soon as we get there, they are
going to deal with your hair and makeup.

315
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,597
Remember, we are not trying to
fool anyone at close range.

316
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,697
You will be in a position where Saunders¡¯
people can only view you from a distance.

317
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:17,997
Yeah.

318
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,496
Is your comm.
unit getting a clear signal?

319
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,597
Oh, it¡¯s fine.

320
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,397
Kim
Yeah?

321
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,597
This is a gun I got for you.

322
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,197
I don¡¯t think you are
going to have to use it,

323
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:28,296
but if you do, don¡¯t hesitate.

324
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,096
Ok

325
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:34,096
Come on, let¡¯s go

326
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:12,794
Please be seated.

327
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:15,294
Thank you for assembling
on short notice.

328
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:19,694
You have already been briefed on the Cordilla
Virus that¡¯s now threatening our cities.

329
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:23,593
What you don¡¯t know is
we have 2 new developments.

330
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:24,793
Wayne.

331
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:28,493
First, a vial of that virus
has already been release.

332
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:32,693
The Chandler Plaza Hotel, here in Los
Angeles, was the site of the first attack.

333
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,092
That situation is being addressed.

334
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:37,292
Secondly, we discovered
the identity of the perpetrator.

335
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:40,592
His name is Stephen Saunders
and he is a former MI6 agent.

336
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:45,592
Now, apparently, Mr. Saunders has at least 11 more vials and
is threatening to release them unless we meet his demands.

337
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,891
Mr. President, what are those demands?

338
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:50,791
So far there have been 2.

339
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:55,791
The first was for the President to use the phrase
¡°the sky is falling¡± in a press conference.

340
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:59,791
He then demanded that we
terminate one of our own agents.

341
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,890
One of our agents? Why?

342
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,389
Well, we are still looking into that.

343
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:08,390
What was his response
when you didn¡¯t comply?

344
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,289
It devastates me to tell you
that I had no choice but to comply.

345
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,990
A half hour ago,

346
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,590
we delivered this agent¡¯s body
to one of Saunders¡¯ representatives.

347
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:25,488
My God.

348
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,888
Millions of lives are at stake.

349
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:32,888
I am going to need each of your departments
to open your files to CTU Los Angeles.

350
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,889
Give them whatever they need.

351
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:47,587
Tony, I am trying to get into some DOD files
for Jack, I need authorization from Cahppelle.

352
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,087
When is he going to be back?

353
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,887
He is not.

354
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:56,887
What do you mean?

355
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:02,987
Could I have everybody¡¯s
attention, please?

356
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:10,586
I am sorry to tell you that,

357
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:15,586
Ryan Chappelle was killed in the
line of duty about a half an hour ago.

358
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:22,885
I can¡¯t give you any more details,

359
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:27,885
but I will be assuming Ryan¡¯s responsibilities
until we hear from Brad Hammond at division.

360
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:36,584
Now, there will be an opportunity
to pay proper respects to Ryan,

361
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:37,884
but now is not the time.

362
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,384
Tony, it¡¯s Chase on line 5.

363
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:45,384
Thanks

364
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:46,684
Almeida.

365
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,483
Yeah, it¡¯s me.
I am at Cole¡¯s house.

366
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:52,483
We found evidence he is almost
certainly symptomatic.

367
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,983
All right, how many people did
he come in contact with over there?

368
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,083
Just his wife.

369
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:58,382
NHS is moving her into
isolation right now.

370
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,882
All right,
I will let the teams know.

371
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:03,082
Tony, transfer me to Kim.
She was running a simulation for me.

372
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,482
Yeah, I gave that to Adam.

373
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:07,382
Kim is out on assignment right now.

374
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,881
What kind of assignment?

375
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:11,382
Well, we are pretty sure that Saunders
has his daughter under surveillance,

376
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:13,982
so Kim is gonna take her
place when we grab her.

377
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,381
Kim is not a field ops

378
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:16,681
What the hell is she doing out there

379
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,482
I don¡¯t want to hear
about it, chase, all right?

380
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:20,181
Kim was the only match
we had available.

381
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,981
Tony, there is got to be other
agents you can use for this.

382
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:22,981
What the hell are you thinking?

383
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:23,881
No, there aren¡¯t

384
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:27,780
Back off, Chase

385
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:29,881
Where is she now?

386
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,581
She is on her way to
Santa Barbara with Jack.

387
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,079
Jack signed off on this?

388
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,780
First of all, it¡¯s my call.

389
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:40,780
Secondly, yes, Jack did, but most
importantly, Kim accepted the assignment.

390
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:45,280
Now, I am gonna transfer you over to Adam.

391
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:50,279
Fine.

392
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,878
Look, I am sorry about what
happened earlier about grabbing you.

393
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,177
I didn¡¯t mean to scare you.

394
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,478
I just don¡¯t think what
you are doing is right.

395
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,778
But I need you to understand something

396
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,378
in the field I am in command.

397
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:10,778
You do what I tell you to do.

398
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,178
Do you understand me?

399
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:14,278
Do you understand me??

400
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,577
Yes

401
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:20,578
Ok, good

402
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:29,576
My nose has been bleeding for almost
an hour, and I can¡¯t get it to stop.

403
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:30,477
All right.

404
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,677
Have a seat and fill this out.

405
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,776
How long will that take?

406
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,576
There are a couple patients ahead
of you, it shouldn¡¯t be too long

407
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:41,175
Thanks

408
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,075
TV: As to how serious this illness is,

409
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:46,075
we have no new information and
the authorities are not commenting.

410
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:50,976
We can¡¯t verify this but we are hearing that
whatever is infecting the people of this hotel,

411
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:53,874
it¡¯s very serious and possibly deadly.

412
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:58,674
Body bags have been spotted, and rescue workers
are positioned around the Chandler Plaza.

413
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:01,674
Authority do not give any
information regarding the estimated...

414
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:02,274
Hey

415
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,274
One minute, sir.

416
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,274
No, now.

417
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,674
I need to see a doctor now.

418
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,874
I was at that hotel. There is
something seriously wrong with me

419
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:13,274
Oh, my god, you are him

420
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:14,973
Dr. Joyner.

421
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:19,973
The man we are supposed to isolate, he is here

422
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,872
Yes

423
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:37,572
We have just identified the body

424
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:38,572
And it¡¯s Chappelle?

425
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:42,872
It's confirmed. The thumbprint
matched the one in his file.

426
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:44,971
Good.

427
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:47,071
Dump the body.
Yes, sir.

428
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,771
You take care of your problem?

429
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,771
Yes, Chappelle is dead.

430
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:54,471
But CTU is still gonna try to
find out what he was working up,

431
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:56,971
so tell Lennox to stay alert,

432
00:24:56,972 --> 00:25:01,871
make sure he doesn¡¯t let
Jan out of his sight.

433
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:02,470
Yeah

434
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,337
Any problems?

435
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,723
No. She is leaving her apartment now.

436
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:07,969
She is going to work.

437
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,165
All right, stay with her.

438
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,569
The next few hours are crucial.

439
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:17,492
I will be here.

440
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,668
Mr. President, we have started down a
slippery slope here, and unless we are

441
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,768
Cut the euphemisms, Jeseph.
What are you trying to say?

442
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:44,267
Sir, we are concerned about the fact that you ordered
the death of a high ranking member of our intelligence

443
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,968
I don¡¯t think we are here to second
guess actions that have already been taken.

444
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:51,667
Joseph, no one is more aware than I am
of the moral ambiguity of my decision.

445
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:55,766
I did it to buy CTU more
time to find Saunders

446
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:59,767
and to delay for as long as
possible the slaughter of millions.

447
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:04,767
I made the decision to
protect their future

448
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:09,866
not mine

449
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,165
Saunders.

450
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:22,165
I have to take this.

451
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:25,764
Yes

452
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,864
I have confirmed the identity of
Chappelle¡¯s body, Mr. President.

453
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:31,665
It will be disposed of respectfully.

454
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,464
We know who you are, Mr. Saunders.

455
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:36,864
Whatever you are trying to
accomplish, you are going to fail.

456
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:40,964
Your only chance is to relinquish
the virus and hope we don¡¯t find you.

457
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:43,764
That¡¯s not going to happen.

458
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,863
What is it you want?

459
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:48,862
To make America clean again.

460
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:51,162
You see, Mr. President

461
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:52,863
the world hates America

462
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:54,763
and for good reason

463
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:59,763
I won¡¯t bother going into the details, you know
better than I the atrocities your nation commits.

464
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:03,362
But we are going to change all that.

465
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:09,362
You and I, together, are going to dismantle the military
machine that exports its ugliness across the globe.

466
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,162
And how are we going to do that?

467
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,562
We will start where the work gets the
dirtiest, something I know a little about.

468
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,161
Covert foreign nationals.

469
00:27:19,162 --> 00:27:21,460
In 32 countries across the
Middle East and Asia,

470
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:24,861
your government employs grade A
through H intelligence consultants.

471
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:27,361
They are citizens of the
countries in which they reside.

472
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,859
They are spies

473
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:33,459
Working against those countries at the
behest of the American military machine.

474
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:38,460
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their
identities sent to me by way of a web site

475
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,610
Sylviaimports.com

476
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,359
If you fail to cmply,

477
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:48,460
I will release 2 vials of the
virus in major cities.

478
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:50,259
And this time,

479
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,259
they won¡¯t be in hotels
where they can be contained.

480
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,056
Agent Bauer, Rachel Forrester.

481
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:35,956
This is Agent Kim Bauer. She is
gonna be doubling for Jana Saunders.

482
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,456
We have already set up a staging area
outside the library where she works

483
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,356
Is it a safe distance away?

484
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:41,756
Yes, we won¡¯t be detected.

485
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:44,556
Is she there yet?
No. She will be in a few minutes.

486
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:49,555
Let¡¯s go ahead. Let¡¯s go.

487
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:07,154
Make sure everybody on the block is
contacted and nobody leaves their house.

488
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:10,654
Sheriff¡¯s department is sending officers over
to patrol a 3 block area until they get here.

489
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:11,954
Use your men. Excuse me.

490
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:14,753
Excuse me.

491
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:15,454
Edmunds.

492
00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:16,753
Yeah, we found Bill Cole.

493
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:20,353
- Where?
- He is at an urgent care center not far from you.

494
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:21,353
Laurel Canyon and Moorpark

495
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:22,253
Yeah, I know where that is.

496
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:24,753
I want you to get over there,
get as much as you can off of Cole.

497
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:26,952
He is pretty agitated, you are
gonna have to help him focus.

498
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:28,652
Tony
Yeah

499
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:30,951
Is Kim in play yet?

500
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:32,752
No. She just landed in Santa Barbara.

501
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:37,753
All right, I will call you.

502
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:45,551
Where is Jane now?

503
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,551
My people have her under
surveillance in the library

504
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,050
working behind the reference desk.

505
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:49,951
How crowded?

506
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,051
10, 20 people

507
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:52,151
Well, one of them belongs to Saunders,

508
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,351
and their orders are gonna be not let her
out of their sight, not for one second.

509
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,851
I know. We have taken over
the surveillance cameras

510
00:29:56,852 --> 00:29:59,350
and we have narrowed down a
list to about 5 probables.

511
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,750
Ok, get that intel over to
Tony Almeida at CTU.

512
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:06,050
Ok, let¡¯s see her.

513
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,250
Ok, now remember, Kim

514
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,650
You are not gonna fool anyone
who knows Jane Saunders up close.

515
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:10,750
I know

516
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:11,649
The staff knows what¡¯s happening

517
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,549
But I want you to stay at least
10 feet behind the counter,

518
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:18,550
and I want you to keep your
head down as much as possible.

519
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,149
the wig looks darker than
Jan¡¯s hair color.

520
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,549
That¡¯s the best we could
do on such short notice.

521
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,549
You are gonna have to match every detail as
closely as possible, her life depends on it.

522
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:49,447
Mr. Cole, when you were inside the
store, who did you come in contact with?

523
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,747
What do you mean, contact?

524
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,746
Who did you talk to?

525
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:54,846
Just the pharmacist
behind the counter.

526
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,047
How many others?

527
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:57,647
Customers?

528
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,147
Yeah, there were some
other people there.

529
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:05,546
How many other people were there?

530
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,346
Bill

531
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:12,346
If we do not identify and track down everyone you have
come in contact with, we are gonna have a citywide epidemic.

532
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:17,445
So how many people?

533
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:22,445
I, I don¡¯t know

534
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:27,845
Think!

535
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:43,243
That¡¯s it. We are now patched
against security.

536
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:47,143
No audio from the system

537
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,043
Nothing on B

538
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,842
Go ahead, try six

539
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:59,242
This screen go ahead isolate front desk

540
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:01,242
5 is good

541
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:14,641
Thank You

542
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:19,040
Oh

543
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,540
I am so sorry

544
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,940
You are not supposed to
have drinks in here.

545
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:36,239
I am sorry, I will throw it away.

546
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:39,239
It¡¯s ok

547
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,438
Start tracking that man
in the red shirt.

548
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,138
I want to know everything that he does.
Yes Sir.

549
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:03,138
Subject is on camera 4 right now.

550
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:08,737
I was just about to replace those.

551
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:37,535
Here you go.

552
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,435
Clear

553
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:48,935
What the hell is taking her so long?

554
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:51,234
Checking all surveillances now

555
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:56,235
Nothing on 1, nothing on 2
Come on

556
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:03,535
Sir, she came out from 4

557
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,332
Kim

558
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,631
There is a man handing
towards the bookcase

559
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:35,832
at your 3 o¡¯clock, red shirt

560
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,632
Might be one of Saunders¡¯ men.

561
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,631
I want you to angle away
from him slowly.

562
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:45,931
Good

563
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:50,431
We just got off the phone with
Chase who is with Cole right now.

564
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:54,631
After Cole left the hotel,
he went to his house in Burbank.

565
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:56,430
He stopped at a gas station
on Riverside Drive

566
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:57,630
But it was self service

567
00:34:57,631 --> 00:35:02,630
and according to what he told the urgent care unit what his wife
confirmed, he didn¡¯t become symptomatic until after he got home.

568
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:05,130
The nose bleeds and the sweating?
Right

569
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,429
Here is where the ripple
effect starts.

570
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,429
At 7:20, he stopped at a pharmacy

571
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:13,430
and asked the pharmacist Sam Tyler for
some medication to stoop the bleeding

572
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:16,329
There were 3 other people inside
that pharmacy at the same time

573
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,329
Right. One of them, Anne Schwartz.

574
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,428
She¡¯s has been going to the pharmacy for
years, so they had her address on file.

575
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,429
We have sent NHS people to her house.

576
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,528
She has a husband and 3 children.

577
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:28,028
What about the other 2 customers?
ID is unknown.

578
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,429
These people could be anywhere, spreading the
disease to anybody they come into contact with

579
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,728
It gets worse.

580
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,028
At the urgent care facility
in Studio City

581
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,828
there were 6 patients in
the waiting area

582
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:42,327
when cole came in, who left before
the quarantine was put in place.

583
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,027
We are tracking them down

584
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,627
But between then and the
staff at the facility

585
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:50,127
We could be looking at
up to 75 people

586
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:55,127
Just in their immediate families. If any of these people
are in a supermarket or a mall when they become symptomatic

587
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:57,927
This thing is going to be
impossible to contain.

588
00:35:57,928 --> 00:36:00,826
We need to identify and
find them now.

589
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,726
Also, I need you to coordinate
with NHS and HazMat.

590
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:08,726
We have to set up a quarantine in 2
neighborhoods in the Burbank Studio City area.

591
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:12,025
Department heads report to Adam.

592
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:33,324
Looks good, everybody, it looks
like this worked.

593
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:38,324
- Maintain monitering Kim. Come get me if anything happens.
- I got it.

594
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:44,724
Thank you, good work

595
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,021
What¡¯s going on?

596
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:17,321
who are you?

597
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:21,220
My name is Jack Bauer,
I am a federal agent.

598
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:23,121
You are not in any danger

599
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:26,120
What do you want?

600
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:28,120
We need your help

601
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,620
We need to get in touch
with your father.

602
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,920
Then get in touch with him.
What do you need me for?

603
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:34,520
We don¡¯t know where he is

604
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:38,020
and we think you do.

605
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,219
What¡¯s this about?

606
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,718
You don¡¯t know who your
father really is.

607
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,719
First of all, I hardly know my father.

608
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,119
And whatever this is,
I know it¡¯s illegal.

609
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,018
You have no right to keep me here.

610
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,318
Release me now,
I haven¡¯t done anything wrong

611
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,719
You¡¯d better listen to me
very carefully, Jane.

612
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,518
Right now your father is engaged in terrorist
activity against the United States of America.

613
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:04,518
This morning, he killed hundreds of people,
and he is threatening to kill thousands more.

614
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:08,317
Now, I can only imaging how difficult
this must be for you to believe,

615
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,517
but trust me, you are going
to cooperate with us.

616
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:14,316
There is a lot at stake,
and there is not a lot of time.

617
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,317
I am not going to do anything.
I want to talk to a lawyer.

618
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,216
There is no lawyer.

619
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:27,216
There is just you and me.

620
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:36,016
I don¡¯t know anything
about my father.

621
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:38,315
He comes into town twice a year.
I have dinner with him.

622
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,016
I don¡¯t even know where he lives.

623
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,515
How do you contact him?

624
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:46,516
I don¡¯t. He calls me.

625
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:52,015
You are lying to me, Jane.
I¡¯m not

626
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:55,315
Don¡¯t try to protect him. You are just
going to get yourself in a world of trouble.

627
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:58,114
You are the one in trouble here.
You are the one breaking the law.

628
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:00,214
You think I am playing a
game here with you?

629
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,914
Hundreds of thousands of people¡¯s
lives are on the line.

630
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:06,813
You have no idea how far I am willing
to go to acquire your cooperation.

631
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:08,214
What are you threatening to do to me?

632
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,514
Where is your father, Jane?

633
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:10,413

Red shirt is approaching her desk.

637
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:25,413
What¡¯s going on?
He¡¯s at the desk.

638
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:27,712
Kim, don¡¯t turn around.
Just stay where you are.

639
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:33,712

644
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,010
Give me a close up on the gentleman
in the red shirt at the desk

645
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,110

647
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:11,410
Ok, Kim, I want you to slowly get up and try to
make your way to the bookshelves in front of you.

648
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:18,210
Stay out of his eye line until
we find out who this guy is.

649
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:51,807
- Maintain a constant visual on her from monitor 3.
- Get camera 3 on Kim

650
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:03,906
We are panning off her.
Get me another angle.

651
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,106
There is no other angle.

652
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:10,106
- What¡¯s going on?
- Jack, we had her a second ago. Camera 3 should be panning back on her in few seconds

653
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:22,304
You work here, don¡¯t you?
Yeah.

654
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:27,104
- Could you help me find something in this aisle?
- Yeah, no problem. What is it that you need?

655
00:41:27,106 --> 00:41:30,805
You call for help,
I will kill you right now

656
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:34,504
Who has Jan Saunders?
Who has Jan Saunders?

657
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:39,504
I don¡¯t know what you
are talking about.

658
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,903
Where the hell is she? Kim

659
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,203
Damn it

660
00:41:50,204 --> 00:41:55,203
Team two, go, go

661
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:31,901
Get down, get down

662
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:42,800
Kim

663
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,299
Kim, step back, step back

664
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,798
Radio back. Tell them

665
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,398
Are you ok?
Yeah, fine.

666
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,999

know we have his daughter.

1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,638
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:13,882
What's wrong?

3
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,329
Keeler.

4
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:17,831
He's bringing your
ex-husband into this debate.

5
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:19,721
The SEC's investigation
into his company.

6
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:22,908
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth
and trust that the people

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,530
will be able to tell the difference.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,635
Jack, what's going on?
Where's Tony?

9
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:28,167
He's been shot.

10
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:30,092
- How bad?
- He was hit in the neck.

11
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,154
He's still alive, they're getting
him to the hospital now.

12
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:34,000
With Tony down,
you're in command.

13
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:37,178
Deliver Ramon Salazar
to the Van Nuys dam.

14
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:40,750
Whoever sent this message is
controlling Kyle Singer's movements.

15
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:44,423
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

16
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:45,841
What are you into Kyle?

17
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,789
These cops, they came
to my apartment today

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,570
and they were saying
something about... using me to,

19
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,162
to bring some weird
disease into the country.

20
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,994
A disease...?

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,145
Go! Run!
I didn't do anything, man!

22
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:58,903
No! Stop!

23
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,597
- You're going to see Salazar?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,354
My dad said questioning
him was a waste of time.

25
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,110
No. Sitting around here
is a waste of time.

26
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,171
Kim, I need you to generate a
prisoner transfer document.

27
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,140
What's this about?

28
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,022
I need to move Ramon Salazar.

29
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:18,242
This has top priority clearance.
No one at CTU is supposed to know.

30
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,085
Either I hand over Ramon Salazar

31
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,765
or his brother will release the virus.

32
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,711
I understand that this is
an impossible choice.

33
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,655
I have another option
for you to consider.

34
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,555
Ramon Salazar would be broken
out of prison and delivered to him.

35
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,454
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack,
but who'll break Salazar out?

36
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:33,826
I will, sir.

37
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,808
This would be my last assignment.

38
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:40,688
If you play this cool, Ramon,
you're walking out of here with me.

39
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,425
Open the cell blocks now.

40
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,823
Let's go. Move!

41
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:59,096
The following takes place
between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm

42
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,161
Good evening to those
of you on the east coast

43
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,632
and good afternoon
to those of you in the west.

44
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:08,487
Welcome to first of three debates
between President Palmer

45
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:10,428
and Senator John Keeler.

46
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:11,616
We'll begin tonight

47
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:15,672
with a two minute opening statement
followed by the first question

48
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:17,969
which will go to
President David Palmer

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,507
as decided by a coin flip
backstage just moments ago.

50
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,309
How're you feeling?

51
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:28,487
Is that a medical question
or a personal one?

52
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,198
Both.

53
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,053
I'm fine.

54
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:35,973
That will be conducted within formats of rules
agreed to by each member of the debate

55
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:38,055
and by the two campaigns.

56
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:40,358
Now we will bring to
the stage the candidates.

57
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,161
Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,963
Senator John Keeler.

59
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:54,769
David, I'm sorry you have to deal
with my ex-husband's lies.

60
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,847
It's alright.

61
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,590
We have the truth on our side.

62
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,892
Ladies and gentlemen,
President David Palmer.

63
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,909
Thank you, John.
Good luck tonight.

64
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:21,596
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Keeler.

65
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,024
Good evening.

66
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,093
I'm looking forward to

67
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:29,067
discussing some
of the critical issues...

68
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:07,770
When I tell you to,

69
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:09,514
you start fighting with
me over the gun.

70
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,345
I gotta try and pull two guards
off the main corridor.

71
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,387
Okay. They're coming.

72
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,575
Help! Help! Help!

73
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,856
That's enough!

74
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,718
Put on his uniform and helmet now!

75
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,492
Split up your men.

76
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,208
I want a team at every security.

77
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,619
No, Jack and Salazar are
somewhere on east block.

78
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,006
You need to put
your men over there.

79
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,795
I got to control this prison,
your partner is not my only problem.

80
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,688
Warden, today he is.

81
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,456
He and Salazar need to be contained
and they need to be kept alive.

82
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:10,456
You want me to redeploy my men?

83
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,195
Then I need to know how
real this terrorist threat is.

84
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,488
Come here.

85
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,446
Ramon Salazar's brother will spread
a deadly virus into the population

86
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,943
unless we release him unharmed.

87
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:28,467
If we don't the death toll will be
in the hundreds of thousands.

88
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,690
This is Warden Mitchell.
Tactical unit five, report to control center.

89
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,260
You're now under the command
of agent Edmunds.

90
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,566
Thank you.

91
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,471
- Yeah?
- Chase, it's Michelle.

92
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,127
What the hell is going on over there?

93
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,781
Jack tried to bring
Salazar out of prison.

94
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:44,727
- He started a riot.
- What?

95
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,475
I think in his own twisted way
he thinks he's gonna deliver him to Hector

96
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,480
and stop the virus from being released.

97
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:52,057
Well he's gonna get himself killed
not to mention Salazar.

98
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,300
I know.

99
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,242
I know, I'm trying to protect him.

100
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,890
What about Kyle Singer?

101
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,586
We're getting close to locating him.

102
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,281
Michelle as soon as you do, call me.

103
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:03,238
If Jack knows we got the carrier
of the virus he'll give Salazar back.

104
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,362
We got everyone working on it Chase.

105
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:08,117
- We'll find him.
- Okay.

106
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:30,783
I'm sorry, Linda.

107
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,657
Linda.

108
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,129
Am I gonna die?

109
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,893
It depends...

110
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,930
if they find us in time.

111
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,642
What do you mean?

112
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,458
The guy from the government...

113
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:07,370
He told my dad that I had
a couple of more hours before I...

114
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:11,211
Before I become contagious.

115
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:14,761
Maybe they'll find us by then.

116
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,062
You'll be okay.

117
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:20,097
Yeah...

118
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,073
maybe.

119
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,295
What are you doing?

120
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,388
There must be some wires in here.

121
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,181
What do you need wire for?

122
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,024
To get you out of this.

123
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,999
Adam. Look at this.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,770
Got it from a Caltrans server.

125
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,549
Traffic camera, right near the mall.

126
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:17,962
Look at that.

127
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,241
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that
what Kyle Singer was wearing?

128
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:21,619
Yeah.

129
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,938
I think there's enough to enhance.
Release it to my screen.

130
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,077
Got it.

131
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,017
- Kim.
- Yes.

132
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,989
I need you a second.

133
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,901
You got this?

134
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,637
- Yeah.
- Alright.

135
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:35,603
Is something wrong?

136
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,778
You haven't been following what's
going on at the prison, have you?

137
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,113
No, Adam and I have been
working on finding Singer.

138
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,709
Why, what is it?

139
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:43,891
Your dad's trying to break out Salazar.

140
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:44,401
What?

141
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,670
Yeah, he's not out yet but
he's acting on his own authority.

142
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,277
He's trying to remove Salazar by force.

143
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,529
I don't understand
what you mean "by force".

144
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,376
Looks like he started a prison riot
to cover the escape.

145
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:55,676
Why is he doing this?

146
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,082
That's what we're trying to figure out.

147
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,487
When's the last time
you heard from him?

148
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,075
About a half hour ago.

149
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,298
He asked me to issue a transfer order

150
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:05,283
for Ramon Salazar and
he gave me a password.

151
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,531
And you did it?

152
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,656
Yeah, he said that
Salazar needed to be moved.

153
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,781
But now you're telling
me this isn't true?

154
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:14,017
No, Kim. I'm sorry.
Your dad lied to you.

155
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:17,473
Why would he do that?

156
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,638
Because he knew
if he asked anybody else

157
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,604
they would know
he was violating protocol.

158
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,894
What's gonna happen to him?

159
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,528
We're gonna try to find him.

160
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,632
The best way out of this whole situation
is to find Kyle Singer.

161
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,784
Then your dad will give up Salazar.

162
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,855
So go back to work, help Adam.

163
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:38,874
Yeah, sure.

164
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,410
We're clear.

165
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,365
We gotta find all their forces through one
entrance to keep the personnel count.

166
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,268
There must be another way, Jack.

167
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,538
There is, but the prisoners
have taken control.

168
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,658
We're gonna have to fight
our way through them.

169
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,194
Get ready.

170
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,548
Hit them up.

171
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,687
Come on.

172
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,436
Come on. Get them on their feet.

173
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,652
Come on, let's go, let's go!

174
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,147
Move, move it!

175
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:32,374
Let's go!

176
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:44,818
Hold your fire!

177
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,197
We have hostages so back off!

178
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,812
Hold your fire!

179
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,162
Come on man!

180
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:52,522
We can make it through.
We've got to move.

181
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,960
Let's go!

182
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:56,293
Move! Let's go!

183
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,205
Go!

184
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,398
Move it! Move it!

185
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,255
And in order to do this,

186
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,776
our fossil fuels most be conserved.

187
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,884
Kim, did you send me that Kalman filter?

188
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,232
What?

189
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,271
The Kalman filter,
I needed to clean up that image.

190
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:28,308
Oh, shoot! I forgot about it.
It's in my help box.

191
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:30,433
How can you forget about it?
It's the only thing you're working on.

192
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,775
I'm sorry, look...

193
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,206
I'm sending it to you, right now.

194
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,205
Done.

195
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,352
Kim, I don't know where your head is at,

196
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:37,584
but we need to find Kyle Singer
before he's contagious.

197
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,199
Relax! I'm doing the best I can.

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,952
The best I can isn't what
we do around here, Kim.

199
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:43,657
- It's either done or it's not.
- So why are you lecturing me,

200
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:45,180
it's in your system.

201
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:55,618
Kaufman.

202
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,009
Is there a problem?

203
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:58,978
I just need to make sure things are
running smoothly around here...

204
00:11:58,979 --> 00:11:59,932
Look, Adam.

205
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,129
I haven't had the chance to brief you but...

206
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,065
Jack created a situation over at the prison.

207
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,458
What kind of situation?

208
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,543
He started a riot to free Salazar.

209
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,909
Now they're caught up in the middle of it.

210
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,254
Wow.

211
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:16,359
He even used Kim to create a transfer
order that started the whole thing.

212
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,334
So cut her a little slack.

213
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,505
Umm...

214
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:22,519
Yeah, okay, I understand.

215
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,263
We're all under a lot of pressure here.

216
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,000
So let's just find Kyle Singer
before it's too late.

217
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:28,663
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Michelle.

218
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:40,099
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here.

219
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,230
You don't deserve what happened.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,698
I do.

221
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,968
If I die¡¦

222
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,733
the virus is dying with me!

223
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,887
Kyle!

224
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,842
Kyle!

225
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,506
Put your feet up here!

226
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,015
Kyle!

227
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,987
Kyle, hold on.

228
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,420
Oh, Kyle.

229
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,907
A "Welcome Home" party?

230
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,846
You shouldn't be doing this.

231
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,783
What are you talking about?

232
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,729
You've been running things.

233
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,012
Show Ramon you're
gonna be his partner.

234
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,305
Not his caterer.

235
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,432
Why do you care?

236
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:16,518
You don't want to be involved
in my business.

237
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,880
No, puppy, I care about you.

238
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,048
And I want you to get
what you've earned.

239
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,093
- Yes?
- It's me.

240
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,620
Riot's still going on.

241
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,146
But we know Ramon's alive.

242
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,302
Yeah.

243
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,280
But Bauer's got to get him out soon.

244
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:47,012
CTU is getting close
to finding Kyle Singer.

245
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,604
And if they do, they'll
never let Ramon go.

246
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,884
Then make sure
they don't find Singer.

247
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,977
- I'm working on it.
- Get it done.

248
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,223
That's him, that's Singer.

249
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:16,625
Was that a gun?

250
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:23,884
Yeah.

251
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,499
Someone's got him.

252
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,944
We're not gonna be able to get the
truck's license plate from this shot.

253
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,117
I'll get access to the traffic cameras
in the direction they're heading.

254
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,935
See if we can find them again.

255
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,171
- Dessler.
- Michelle.

256
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:39,137
We found Kyle Singer being driven
away from the mall, 47 minutes ago.

257
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,763
Are you working up a vehicle ID?

258
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,175
We will, as soon as
we're able to get any visual.

259
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,560
This camera's damaged. It's malfunctional.

260
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,537
Must have the hostages on the right.

261
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,027
Try and pan the camera over.

262
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,709
They may see the camera move.

263
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,390
We don't have a choice. Do it.

264
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,778
There they are.

265
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,258
We got to get in there before
they start killing everyone.

266
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,613
Come on! Come on!

267
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,186
Faster! Faster!

268
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:15,457
Let's start wasting the guards
unless they let us walk

269
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,885
First step outside, bang!

270
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:19,740
Headshot from a sniper.

271
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:20,835
You don't know that.

272
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,166
I know, cause that's
what went down in Chino

273
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:27,765
They'll let the guard get wasted cause
all they care about is keeping us in.

274
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:30,160
What the hell are we doing here then?

275
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,922
Give me your gun.

276
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:39,076
Bring them over here.

277
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,002
We're gonna have
a little fun with them.

278
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:42,609
Put them on their knees.

279
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,663
Who wants to live?

280
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,851
Okay.

281
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,758
Let's try it again.

282
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,637
- Who wants to live?
- Me.

283
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,390
I do.

284
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,167
Him. Over here.

285
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,458
Come on.

286
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,851
Who else?

287
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,484
I've never seen you before.

288
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:32,531
I'm new here.

289
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,755
Him. Over here.

290
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,288
One in six chance.

291
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,991
You first.

292
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:10,628
Please.

293
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,673
Don't make me do this man.

294
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,028
There's nothing to it, you little bitch.

295
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:17,272
- Just put the gun to your head.
- I can't!

296
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,146
I can't...

297
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,659
You're gonna do it.
You hear me?

298
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,760
- You're gonna do it.
- Please, please.

299
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,955
It's easy, see?

300
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,674
All you gotta do is smile...

301
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,074
and pull the trigger.

302
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,820
Now it's one in five.

303
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:59,381
Let's go!

304
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,831
No!

305
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,784
No, I can't...

306
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,333
I can't...

307
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,450
- This is a waste of my time. Shoot him.
- No, wait!

308
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,252
- Shoot him!
- Wait!

309
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,083
Come on, man.

310
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,063
Just do it.

311
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,476
This way at least you've
got a chance, okay?

312
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:30,982
Do it.

313
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,542
Come on!

314
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,636
If you're not gonna do it,

315
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,558
we will.

316
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,505
We have a winner.

317
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,658
Let's hear it for the new guy.

318
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:14,290
We're now seeing concrete results.

319
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,084
This is a road we will continue to travel.

320
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:25,307
I got a shot coming in from a camera at the
next intersection definitely the same truck.

321
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,852
Can you read the license plate?

322
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,841
We won't be able to read anything
until it finishes downloading.

323
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,345
I just saw the IAD inquiry
coming over the system

324
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,736
about what you're father's
doing at the prison.

325
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,702
They're questioning the transfer
you generated for him.

326
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,742
I heard.

327
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:46,551
If you want me to say that you didn't know
he was gonna use it to break out Salazar¡¦

328
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:48,188
I will.

329
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,365
Thanks. I'll be okay.

330
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:57,329
Hold on. It stopped downloading,
I'm getting an error message.

331
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,976
Error 402 that...

332
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,500
means trouble with the internal router.

333
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,858
Gael.

334
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,304
What are you doing?

335
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,618
There's a problem with
one of the routers.

336
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,436
I'm trying to fix it.

337
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,129
Why don't you call Tech.

338
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,798
No, it's okay.

339
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:42,703
I think I found the problem.

340
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,354
Checks on circuit kicked in.

341
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:46,318
Must have been one of the line surge.

342
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:49,953
Should be up and running now.

343
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,788
Let me know if you have
any more problems.

344
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,346
I will.

345
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,231
Hey, it's back up. What was it?

346
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,511
I'm not sure.

347
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:09,117
Is it possible a line surge
could have knocked out a router?

348
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,958
Well not from my side,
you can ask Chloe?

349
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:18,880
Got it.

350
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:21,847
Hold on.

351
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,034
Dessler.

352
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:24,477
Michelle, I've got a plate on the pick up.

353
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:25,999
Good, where do you last have it?

354
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,373
The shots on the north part of
Santa Fe Springs, it was driving west.

355
00:22:29,374 --> 00:22:31,743
Okay, I want you to put this
out to mobile units LAPD.

356
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:33,423
I want everyone looking for this vehicle.

357
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:34,636
Okay, right.

358
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,998
Alright, Ryan, I'm back.

359
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:42,240
So do you have any idea if Bauer
is trying to break out Salazar on his own

360
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,097
or if he is working with someone?

361
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,953
I'm trying to figure that out now.

362
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,411
- I'll get back to you when I found out.
- You do that.

363
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,686
Chloe?

364
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:57,160
Yeah, Michelle?

365
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,971
Are you following
what's going on at the prison?

366
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:01,421
I just saw the update come over.
What the hell's happening?

367
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,870
We don't have all the details
yet but Jack's behind it.

368
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:06,222
I need you to check
his phone logs, e-mail¡¦

369
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:08,573
See what case files he's
accessed recently.

370
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:10,189
What am I looking for?

371
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,936
Anything that'll help us
figure out why he's doing this.

372
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:15,682
Are you sure? You really want
me snooping in his office?

373
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,067
Yes.

374
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,872
You got it.

375
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,613
Surgery?

376
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,837
Yeah, this is Tony
Almedia's wife Michelle.

377
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:43,028
- How's he doing?
- Ah... I'll check. One moment please.

378
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,366
- Mrs. Almeida?
- Yeah?

379
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:48,534
He's still in surgery.

380
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:51,416
You'll be contacted as soon
as he's rolled into recovery.

381
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,212
What room is he in?

382
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,428
Umm... Operating room 4.

383
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:58,464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

384
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,103
- Network ops, Evan.
- Yeah, Evan, it's Michelle.

385
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,812
Do you know if we get all
our feeds from Good Samaritan?

386
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,536
Let me check.

387
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,294
Yeah, they do.
What do you need?

388
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,271
See if they're video docu-ing OR4.

389
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,247
Yeah, they are.
Where do you want it?

390
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:23,437
- Send it to my desk top.
- Alright. It'll take a second.

391
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,212
Right, there you go.
Anything else?

392
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,224
- No. Thank you.
- Sure.

393
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:53,571
- Four by four.
- More pressure.

394
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:57,084
- Hold that down.
- I've got it. /- There you go.

395
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,766
Do you have another clamp?

396
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:04,682
Clamp.

397
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:30,980
The laundry room's
a hundred yards in.

398
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,930
I'll ID the exact locations for
the explosives once we get there.

399
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:34,767
Yes, sir.

400
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,874
Sir, we're ready for you.

401
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,500
Monitor's up.

402
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,630
You should be seeing it on your IPC.

403
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:00,267
- It's working.
- Okay.

404
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:04,317
Alright, let's go.

405
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:06,659
Radio silence while we're in there.

406
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,038
If they hear us, they might kill everyone.

407
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,434
- Copy that.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,849
Let's go.

409
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,194
Alright!

410
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,349
Round two!

411
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:30,894
Then you.

412
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:32,928
I'm a prisoner, not a guard.

413
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,020
I'm Ramon Salazar.

414
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:37,194
- I'm sure you've heard of me.
- You should pick someone else,

415
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,097
he's telling you the truth.

416
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,344
He's just transferred to cell block
less than a week ago.

417
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:45,091
I'm a federal agent, I was
escorting him out of the prison.

418
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,174
That's why you've never
seen us here before.

419
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,901
Good.

420
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,342
Federal agent.

421
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,579
What's your name?

422
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,083
Jack Bauer.

423
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,788
Alright.

424
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,775
It's gonna be agent Jack

425
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,426
against Ramon Salazar.

426
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,015
A battle to the finish!

427
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,011
Come on, Jack.

428
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:37,279
Show this foreigner how it's done.

429
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:15,056
If I die,

430
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:17,265
- my brother will find you.
- Shut up!

431
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,394
Do it!

432
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,568
Alright.

433
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,188
You're up.

434
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:59,449
Looks like your mother's a title, Jack.

435
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,220
Ramon, stay down!

436
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,599
Come on!

437
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:52,987
All clear!
Hold your fire!

438
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,997
Jack!

439
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:01,281
Jack!

440
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:07,244
I have no triumphs.

441
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,230
Only defeats.

442
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,703
God!

443
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,864
- Lab.
- This is Chloe O'Brian.

444
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,322
I'm in Jack's office.

445
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:02,327
Could you send someone
up the drug kit, please?

446
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,647
It's on its way.

447
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:09,481
The differences on the issues are clear.

448
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,821
But I believe you don't elect a platform.

449
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:15,126
You elect a man.

450
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:16,825
And I am frankly troubled

451
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:19,607
by some of the personal choices
that this president has made

452
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,674
and continues to make.

453
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:24,504
We're all aware of the allegations

454
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:27,449
and indictments surrounding
the President's former wife.

455
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,289
Most of us have operated
under the assumption

456
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,128
that the President will
not repeat his history

457
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:36,971
of associating with the persons
of questionable moral character.

458
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:38,592
However,

459
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:40,784
my office has just learned

460
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:44,372
that the woman with whom the
President is currently involved,

461
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,477
Doctor Anne Packard

462
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:51,723
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

463
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:55,237
A drug which later led to the deaths
of three innocent people.

464
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:56,907
This is outrageous.

465
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:00,986
This debate is not a court of law
nor is it a tabloid paper.

466
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,218
This is neither the time nor the place

467
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,789
to launch a personal
attack on a private citizen.

468
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,063
Mr. President

469
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:10,685
the Senator still has 30 more seconds.
Sir, please.

470
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:12,463
This is exactly the right time.

471
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,941
Because I believe the choices your
leaders make in their own lives

472
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:19,741
reflect the choices that they
will make on your behalf.

473
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,599
And so the question remains.

474
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,086
Did the President know of these
accusations and choose to ignore them?

475
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:30,432
Or is he repeating past
mistakes once again?

476
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,102
Mr. President your rebuttal.

477
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:38,681
I can tell you with complete confidence

478
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:42,506
that the Senator's accusation is false.

479
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,323
And that I believe it is the Senator's
way of aborting the issues at hand.

480
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:52,039
Now I came here tonight to discuss
the real issues pressing our country.

481
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,316
Oh, god.

482
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:55,986
- I assume that the Senator was...
- Now do you get it?

483
00:32:55,987 --> 00:33:01,054
I do not believe this is something
to be swept under the rug and forgotten.

484
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:19,496
It's positive.

485
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,544
I'll go tell Michelle.

486
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:44,356
Chloe, what are you doing
in my dad's office?

487
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,449
Michelle wanted me to go
through your dad's stuff.

488
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,117
Why?

489
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:50,857
To find anything that can help us
understand what he's doing.

490
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:51,899
What's up?

491
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,586
I wanted to know if a line surge could shut
down a router on your side of the ITS room.

492
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,636
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs.
Not in my ITS.

493
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,917
Why?

494
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,515
Ah, it's probably nothing.

495
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:08,957
Did you find anything?

496
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,700
I can't talk about this.

497
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,563
Why not, maybe I can help.

498
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,708
You can't help so just go, okay?

499
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,354
What's in the box?

500
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,880
Just stuff I'm taking to Michelle.

501
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,364
This is really an
inappropriate behavior, Kim.

502
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:25,159
Why are you doing this, Chloe?
I mean...

503
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm just trying to help you.

504
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,522
You can't help.
And I don't have to have this conversation.

505
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,200
Under field op mandate,
there's a regulation.

506
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:35,459
I believe it's 40 or 41 that says
that I have jurisdictional prerogative.

507
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:36,834
So could you just leave?

508
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:39,228
Not until you tell me what's in the box.

509
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:44,711
I think your dad's been using drugs.

510
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:47,505
- What?
- That's right.

511
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,198
Rubber tourniquet,

512
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,656
syringe.

513
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:57,511
We just had the vials tested of opiates,
It was positive.

514
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:00,343
He's been acting really weird. Okay?

515
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:13,492
It's really not fair you made me do this.

516
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,290
It's very uncomfortable.

517
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:27,994
Michelle?

518
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:31,535
I didn't find anything in Jack's records
but there is something you need to see.

519
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:47,022
You found this in his office?

520
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:49,461
I wanted to make sure
what it was before I showed you.

521
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:51,899
The liquid in these vials
tested positive for opiates.

522
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,504
Probably heroine.

523
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:55,353
I think Jack's a user.

524
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,785
I got it.

525
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,907
A patrol car just found the
truck Kyle Singer was in

526
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:06,344
parked in a industrial complex
in Fuller and fourth 2000 block.

527
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:08,493
Pipe these into the teams on standby.

528
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:12,606
Assume everyone on the site is contagious
and use level 1 CDC protocol.

529
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:14,038
Let's get him!

530
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,690
Damn!

531
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,156
Is there any other way out?

532
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:39,479
No, we're pinned in.

533
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,105
We must have known this could happen.

534
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,089
What's the plan, Jack?

535
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,361
Give me the shotgun.

536
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,371
Give me the shotgun.

537
00:37:00,357 --> 00:37:02,100
Take off your uniform.

538
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:15,390
I have worked the past year with my
administration on my overall academic plan.

539
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,928
The projection could not look better.

540
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:21,442
- Dessler.
- This is Cowgil.

541
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:23,482
Approaching the industrial complex on Fuller.

542
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,520
There are three warehouses on the property.

543
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:27,230
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared.

544
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:28,137
Roger.

545
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,538
Kaufman.

546
00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:38,095
Adam, see if you can pull up an infrared
satellite on the industrial complex.

547
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:39,299
On it.

548
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:42,342
Kim, log into the NHA server.

549
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,010
We need to see if they have
any satellites in position.

550
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:51,251
Kim!

551
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,617
Okay.

552
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,316
What's the matter?

553
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,253
Nothing, I'm fine.

554
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:17,230
We just swept these blocks.
There's no sign of Jack or Salazar.

555
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:18,404
Look I got a team in the assault block.

556
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,158
They can't do a proper
search until we lock it down.

557
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,193
That can take up to a half hour.

558
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,710
If you want to get out of this thing,

559
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,220
you gonna have to trust me.

560
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,155
And do everything that I tell you.

561
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:31,027
You understand?

562
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:32,705
Alright.

563
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,800
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, here's what I want you to do.

564
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,181
I want you to take that chopper
and I want you sweep the perimeter.

565
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,140
Chase!

566
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,603
- What are you doing, Jack?
- You get these people to move back.

567
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:46,195
Or you're gonna have to take me out.

568
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:47,588
We need that chopper.

569
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:48,652
Don't do this.

570
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,308
I just spoke with Michelle,

571
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,090
we're close to getting Kyle Singer.

572
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:53,872
Close ain't gonna cut it this time.

573
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,287
I gotta deliver Salazar now!

574
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:58,280
I'm not letting you go, Jack!

575
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:01,344
How long is it gonna
take to find Kyle Singer?

576
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:03,629
A half an hour? An hour?

577
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,680
I gotta get Salazar in the air,
in that chopper in the next 60 seconds.

578
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,845
Or hundred thousand people will die.

579
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,241
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

580
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,311
Let him go.

581
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:35,041
We'll track the chopper. I need you to
keep your people under control, Warden.

582
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:36,533
Please.

583
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,161
I can't have anything happen to Salazar.

584
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,303
Alright.

585
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,380
This is Warden Mitchell,
I want all teams to stand down.

586
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,463
I repeat, stand down!

587
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,334
Agent Bauer will take Salazar
to the SWAT chopper.

588
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:56,487
I want a conformation from
all teams on the stand down order.

589
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,123
Let him take the chopper.

590
00:39:59,078 --> 00:40:01,313
Stand down.

591
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,560
Alright? Back off.

592
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:06,830
Alright, Jack.

593
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:08,558
No one's gonna try and stop you.

594
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,964
Get these men to back off
and holster their weapons.

595
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:12,993
Back off! Stand down!

596
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:14,872
Let them through!

597
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,645
Let's go.

598
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:22,100
- Get them to holster their weapons.
- Holdster your weapons!

599
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:24,334
- Lower your weapon!
- Stand down!

600
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:27,027
Get the snipers down,
off the roof, now!

601
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:29,719
- Now!
- Off the roof! Get off the roof!

602
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,132
Back off!

603
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,554
Do what he says!

604
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,988
We have Singer plus one.

605
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,132
Center, Singer plus one.

606
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:24,324
What's he doing?

607
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:26,453
Disabling or calming the locator.

608
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,516
Yes?

609
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:35,786
Chase, it's Michelle.
We have Kyle Singer.

610
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:37,649
I can't hear you.

611
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:39,896
We found Kyle Singer.

612
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,011
- We've got Kyle?!
- Yes!

613
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:43,492
Jack!

614
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:46,077
Jack, we found Kyle Singer!

615
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:47,442
Jack!

616
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,159
Jack! Jack!

617
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:51,921
Jack!!

618
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:08,669
You can talk about facts or figures
all night, Mr. President.

619
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,986
Once again

620
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:15,602
I see this as a question
of judgment and integrity.

621
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:20,036
Ignore this issue, an issue of rectitude
and foresightedness...

622
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:38,485
Congratulations.

623
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:42,030
Now you are an even bigger enemy
to your country than me.

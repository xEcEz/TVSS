1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,095
Hey, by the way, thanks
for keepin' me company.

2
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:16,921
And miss a chance to ride
out to the country? Sure.

3
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,033
Maybe you and jim will
move out here someday.

4
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:21,069
No. Jim is a city boy.

5
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,589
I think village square is about
as country as he's gonna get.

6
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:25,611
I never thought this
house would sell.

7
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,347
Yeah, you and me both.

8
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:29,824
It's changed hands
4 times in 10 years.

9
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:32,526
Well, you know what they say.
It is the most haunted house...

10
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,090
In driscoll county.

11
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,428
I think it's not selling
'cause it's a money pit,

12
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:38,622
Not because of the ghosts.

13
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:39,923
Wow. This from you?

14
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:42,198
Vacant houses usually
aren't haunted.

15
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:42,925
No?

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,328
They need the energy of
the living to feed off of.

17
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,830
There are more ghosts
in dentists' offices

18
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,766
Than there are in an
abandoned house like this.

19
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:50,967
Oh. Well, that must explain
my dentist's bad breath.

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,179
Eww.

21
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,871
Hey! My first guests. Come on in.

22
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:59,132
Hey. Steve, i
- I hope you don't mind i brought a friend.

23
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:00,789
This is melinda rdon. Hi.

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,993
I'm sorry. I just had
hand-To-Hand combat with a saw,

25
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:05,162
And the saw won.

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,330
Ouch. Yeah.

27
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,195
That word came in
handy a lot today,

28
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:09,781
Along with a few others, huh?

29
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:13,048
Well, i was just stopping by
to see how you were settling in,

30
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:13,896
If you needed anything.

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,021
Uh, yeah, a how-To
book on power tools.

32
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,041
This is my daughter.

33
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,762
Hi. Marlo, pioneer girl.

34
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:20,948
Do your horses need some feed?

35
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,603
Wagon wheels need a-Fixin'?

36
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:26,094
Marlo's just annoyed because the
closest mall is 10 miles away.

37
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:29,555
No, i'm annoyed because my
friends are a hundred miles away.

38
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,756
Anyway, i just have a couple papers

39
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,758
I need you to sign
from the title company.

40
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:33,469
Yeah, sure.

41
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,220
You know, i think i'm
gonna clean up my thumb.

42
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,623
I'd rather not sign in blood.

43
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,642
Well, you're gonna,
whether you want to or not.

44
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:44,448
Hey, you work at an antique
store, too, don't you?

45
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,044
Uh, yeah. That's my boss.

46
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:47,580
Oh. Hi.

47
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:48,456
Hi.

48
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,127
I found some really
cool old board games.

49
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,157
I was gonna keep some of them-

50
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,813
There's not a ton of entertainment
here at the homestead.

51
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,919
But i was wondering if you
could tell me what they're worth?

52
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,934
Sure. I could take a look at 'em.

53
00:01:58,936 --> 00:01:59,701
Oh, perfect.

54
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,162
Have you ever heard
of a game called, uh...

55
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:03,368
Twister?

56
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:08,267
You wanna come and
check out the games?

57
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:09,605
No. I'm good. I'm
just gonna explore.

58
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,390
Ok.

59
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,868
Yep. This game. I'm not sure if
all the pieces are here, though.

60
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:16,940
This is a great game, yahtzee.

61
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:17,875
You've never played?

62
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:18,395
Never played it.

63
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,233
Is someone here?

64
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,364
Hello.

65
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,272
Hello.

66
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,512
I can help you.

67
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:13,972
Who are you?

68
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,944
One of them will die.

69
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:30,835
Are you ok?

70
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,388
Wonder when this tipped.

71
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,322
Floor's rotted through underneath.

72
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,876
Made a little river
all through the ceiling.

73
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:29,889
What a mess.

74
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,177
I'm gonna see if marlo's
finished cleanin' herself up,

75
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,780
And i'll bring up some
paper towels and...

76
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,660
I'll bring her back up here.

77
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,430
You know, for a minute there...

78
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,148
You almost thought
there was a ghost?

79
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:43,901
No.

80
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,778
Have to remember my rule.

81
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,042
What rule?

82
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:51,790
Rational explanation
for almost everything.

83
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:53,286
Right.

84
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,275
Do you know why they moved?

85
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,102
You know, steve lost his
wife a few years back.

86
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:15,580
He said that marlo was having

87
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,178
A hard time in high school,

88
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:19,282
And i guess it was just too painful

89
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,086
To stay in the house.

90
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,437
Oh, that is so sad.

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,761
It's really hard on a kid
when they lose a parent.

92
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,066
Yeah.

93
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,504
It can be hard on
the other parent, too.

94
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,198
So do you know what happened?

95
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,169
Do you know why she died?

96
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,263
No. He didn't say.
I don't know if...

97
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:42,481
Wait. I know that
tone in your voice.

98
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:43,944
You are asking for a reason.

99
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,096
I saw something, someone.

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,330
Are you saying that you saw
a ghost in steve's house?

101
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,788
In the garage, actually.

102
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,787
What? It's just that-

103
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:58,304
I mean, there's always a damn ghost

104
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,832
Everywhere you go. What is that?

105
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,865
Ok, i wish they weren't
always there, too, believe me.

106
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,485
But it's not like i go
out looking for them.

107
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:06,839
Don't you?

108
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:09,506
What?

109
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,408
Look, i'm sorry.

110
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,341
It's just that marlo and steve

111
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,711
Have been through so much.

112
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:18,358
They just need a clean start.

113
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,017
They don't need to
hear about ghosts

114
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:21,787
And have their whole
lives turned around.

115
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,125
Yeah, but what if the
ghost is marlo's mother?

116
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:26,530
Melinda, they especially
don't need to hear that.

117
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,015
They need time to heal.

118
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,591
There's obviously a-

119
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,982
A rational explanation. Well,
it's not always that easy.

120
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,902
I am just asking you
to give them some peace.

121
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,858
It's up to the ghost, not me.

122
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:43,070
Fine.

123
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,385
You're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

124
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,309
I just sometimes
don't understand her.

125
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,997
I mean, what's it
gonna take, you know?

126
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,454
After all she's seen,
she can't just say,

127
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:58,905
"Ok, i get it. There's ghosts. "

128
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,407
Well, sometimes what
people don't believe

129
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,349
Is just as important to
them as what they do believe,

130
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,271
And some people feel better

131
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:07,341
Thinkin' that there's
nothin' after we die.

132
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,912
You didn't have a
hard time believing.

133
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,746
Well, it was because
i believed you.

134
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,039
Also, i don't know...

135
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:16,610
What?

136
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,648
Come on.

137
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:19,895
I always wanted to believe.

138
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:22,267
I mean, i always wanted to
believe that there was more.

139
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:23,815
I mean, after my father died,

140
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,163
I wanted to think that
everything we do here

141
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,617
Does not come to
nothing. And then...

142
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:31,577
There was melinda.

143
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,160
So what do you think?

144
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,268
Should i just stay out of it,

145
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:38,737
Let the family live in peace?

146
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,921
Hey, who says they're in peace?

147
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:44,320
I think you can cross this
ghost over quickly and quietly-

148
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:45,826
In, out, nobody gets hurt.

149
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,129
Ha. Famous last words.

150
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:29,516
Are you here?

151
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,399
You scared me.

152
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:47,902
What are you doing in my garage?

153
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:51,340
I'm sorry. Um, it's
just that the, uh-

154
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:54,357
The furniture, it's so interesting.

155
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,873
Um, we could sell some of
it for you if you wanted.

156
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:01,701
I had a little something for marlo.

157
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:05,512
That's ok. I'd like to give
it to her myself, if i could.

158
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:12,273
It's adorable. Thank you so much.

159
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,003
It suits her.

160
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:15,317
I have to keep her in here,

161
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,557
'Cause my dad's not
crazy about cats.

162
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,556
How's your dad doing? He seemed-

163
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:20,567
Moody?

164
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,450
Right.

165
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,806
He's been doin' pretty
well since my mom died.

166
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,349
What was her name?

167
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,062
Liz. Short for lisbeth.

168
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,619
She hated being called lisbeth.

169
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,779
Must be hard for you,

170
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,699
Moving and all, not knowing anyone.

171
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,190
She got me.

172
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,127
What?

173
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:53,744
My mom.

174
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,417
She-She got me.

175
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,385
She was the only one.

176
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,043
Well, i'm sure your father-

177
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:04,692
I know.

178
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:07,991
But not like her.

179
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,902
Now i don't think
anybody ever will.

180
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:18,590
Sometimes i think he
blames me for what happened.

181
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:24,566
What happened?

182
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:29,824
Where's dora?

183
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,661
I hope she didn't
go in my dad's room.

184
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,048
Hang on.

185
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:47,085
Liz?

186
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,745
What happened?

187
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,039
The cat, it died.

188
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,340
What did you do to her?

189
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,694
I didn't do anything to her.

190
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,779
I just found her like that.

191
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,737
Might have been some
rat poison or something.

192
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,052
I'm sorry, honey.

193
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,169
Steve, are you ok?

194
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:21,748
Yeah.

195
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,700
She sure did like that cat.

196
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:40,821
Yeah?

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,567
Hey. Steve. I'm so
sorry to bug you,

198
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,363
But i just thought i could walk
you through these county tax...

199
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,129
Rebate forms.

200
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:51,813
You know, it's a great program,

201
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,098
Especially if you plan on
putting any money into the place.

202
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,595
What's wrong with the place?

203
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,671
Well, you know. I
mean, whatever you do

204
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,243
For improvements, things like that.

205
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,638
I like the place
just the way it is.

206
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,705
Ok. Well, then, um, i could just-

207
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:05,511
Just forget it.

208
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,668
If it makes life easier,
he's not interested.

209
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,375
Yeah, well, you're the
expert on easy livin'.

210
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,967
Never do today what you can
put off till tomorrow, right?

211
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,624
What are you saying? I'm lazy?

212
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,109
You didn't think i was lazy

213
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:18,497
When certain things had to
be done to a certain person.

214
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,268
I should have stopped you.

215
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:21,807
That's easy to say now,

216
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,289
But you had too much
to gain, didn't you?

217
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,945
As long as i was doing it, you
weren't gonna stand in my way.

218
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,369
You know, it looks like
i came at a bad time,

219
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,610
So i'm just gonna
leave these over here.

220
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:34,093
Bad time for what?

221
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:37,008
Um, to sign the tax rebate form.

222
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,289
It's ok. I can just leave it.

223
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,583
If i sign it, will you
get the hell out of here?

224
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,740
Um, yeah.

225
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,505
It was like they were
2 different people.

226
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,743
It was so eerie.

227
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:01,574
Like they were in a trance?

228
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,452
Yeah, exactly. And
they kept talking about

229
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,886
Having done something to somebody,

230
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:10,742
And marlo said that her dad had
too much to gain to stop her. Weird.

231
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,984
Could they have been
talking about marlo's mother?

232
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:18,076
Well, why would you think steve would have
done something to the mother of his child?

233
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,370
Because of this.

234
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,405
"Liz sinclair, 36,
of oak hills died

235
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,968
"In a fatal fall
from a hiking trail

236
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:27,120
"In the northwest section
of ryden state park.

237
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,180
"Her hiking companions,
husband steven sinclair, 37,

238
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:33,086
"And daughter marlo,
15, were unharmed.

239
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,533
"Sinclair was questioned
late into the night

240
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,895
"By the county sheriff and
released the next morning.

241
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,470
Officials would make
no further comment. "

242
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:40,631
Yeah. Well, obviously
they let him go.

243
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,637
Yeah, which only means
they had no proof.

244
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,669
I mean, it could explain
why liz is haunting him.

245
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,925
Then again, marlo did
say that steve blames her.

246
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:47,831
Maybe she's haunting marlo.

247
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,316
Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

248
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,674
Did you say anything

249
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,942
The last time you were there
about ghosts or hauntings?

250
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:53,927
No.

251
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,148
Are you sure?

252
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,712
Yeah, of course i'm sure. Why?

253
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,457
I don't know. Maybe it's like

254
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,793
Power of suggestion, you know?

255
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:00,923
They think they're haunted,

256
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,365
So then they just
start acting like it.

257
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,762
Ok, i love you

258
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,072
Like a sister, really, i do,

259
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,386
But you are the
most stubborn person

260
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:09,717
I have met in my entire life.

261
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:11,912
I mean, you will twist
yourself up into a pretzel

262
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,078
Trying to rationalize some-

263
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:15,941
I'm sorry, i'm just looking for
a logical reason for them to-

264
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:18,937
Oh, you mean the believable
reason, not the real reason,

265
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:20,563
But the easy reason.

266
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:23,957
Whatever makes you comfortable.

267
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,147
Let me get this straight.

268
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,812
Daddy and daughter move to the
country to get away from it all.

269
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,108
There's a ghost in the
garage that predicts

270
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:36,797
That one of them will be dead soon.

271
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,550
The cat turns up
somewhat less than alive,

272
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,828
And daddy buries it like it's
just another day of yardwork.

273
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:42,736
And this morning...

274
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,318
And this morning, delia
goes over to the house

275
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:46,814
And finds herself in the middle
of who's afraid of virginia woolf?

276
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:47,767
What are you doing?

277
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,752
Oh. I'm, uh-I'm trying

278
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,224
A radical new technique
to my class lectures.

279
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:53,789
What? Preparation.

280
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,520
Ok, so what am i looking
at with this ghost?

281
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,929
You're looking at, uh...

282
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:00,347
A little more jack nicholson,
little less linda blair.

283
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:01,411
Meaning?

284
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:03,923
Meaning it's not like there's a
demon taking over their bodies.

285
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,885
It sounds like there's a spirit
influencing them from the outside,

286
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,302
Controlling their
behavior from time to time.

287
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,647
It's called "oppression. "

288
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:12,182
You mean "possession. "

289
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,703
No. I say what i mean. I
mean what i say, damn it.

290
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,104
I said, "oppression. "

291
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,220
Ok, oppression. Sorry.
Never heard of it.

292
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:21,839
Basically it's when a
spirit controls a body

293
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,755
Without ever entering inside of it.

294
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,791
It's a bit like
hypnotic suggestion.

295
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:28,542
In essence, it directs how
it wants the body to behave,

296
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,939
And what's really
creepy is over time,

297
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:32,458
The person begins to act
more and more like that ghost.

298
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,383
It's possession lite, if you will.

299
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,360
It's all the bad manners
with half the head-Spinning.

300
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,882
Ok, so why not go
full-On possession?

301
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:42,052
Ah, possession, that's
a tool used by demons,

302
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,169
Spirits that never walked
the earth in human form,

303
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,050
Whereas oppression these are-These
are used by earthbound spirits,

304
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,877
Earthbound spirits
that are very stubborn

305
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:50,536
And will do whatever it
takes to get what they want.

306
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:51,528
Which is?

307
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,698
That's for the ghost to
know and for you to find out.

308
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:56,037
Ok, so how do i get the ghost
to stop, to leave them alone?

309
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:59,522
That's hard to say. I'm not
sure, but i do know this.

310
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,239
You have to be careful,
because an oppressive spirit

311
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:04,612
They will really take
advantage of any weakness,

312
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,690
Any vulnerability
that their host has-

313
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,553
A mental illness,
emotional turmoil.

314
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,924
Turmoil like, "i killed a loved
one"? That kind of turmoil?

315
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,611
Oh. Ok, i was thinking more
like white slacks in november,

316
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,397
But sure, that would work also.

317
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,244
Steve?

318
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,554
Hey. Uh, i-I'm sorry that
i didn't call first. I just-

319
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,096
You play from your
head, not your heart.

320
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:10,529
That's why you lose.

321
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,602
I don't always lose.

322
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:15,949
Sometimes just let you win.

323
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,301
Why?

324
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,031
Mess with your head a little bit,

325
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,756
False confidence
- Things like that.

326
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,861
Heh. You think i'm
falsely confident?

327
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:26,318
Why don't you make yourself
useful and go get me a drink?

328
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,226
Good idea.

329
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:37,969
Liz?

330
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,602
Stop it!

331
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,806
You're not liz
sinclair. Who are you?

332
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,225
You see me, don't you?

333
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,001
Leave them alone.

334
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,087
Matt, we have more company.

335
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:01,046
Whoa. It's scary when they
look right at you like that.

336
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,630
Marlo, look, i don't
know if you can hear me,

337
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:09,736
But you're being used.

338
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:13,639
I- I know that you can't see
them, but you- You can feel them.

339
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,792
Steve, please listen to me, ok?

340
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,146
You don't know what's happening.

341
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,365
Both of you get out of
this house right now!

342
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,563
Steve.

343
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,549
What did you do?

344
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,092
My daughter.

345
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:50,901
Where's my daughter?

346
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:53,043
She right here. She's fine.

347
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,141
She's goin' with you.

348
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,793
Hey, stay with these 2 guys.

349
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,911
They'll take care
of you, all right?

350
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,309
You're playing too rough.

351
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,218
You're gonna break them
like you broke the others.

352
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,470
You're just a sore loser.

353
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,439
No, i am not.

354
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,722
It's just that these two
are too perfect to lose.

355
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,726
I mean, all that guilt, i
can practically taste it.

356
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,675
What the hell are you two doing?

357
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,964
Sorry. It's a private game.

358
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,795
Oh, is that what this is? You just
play with them like they're toys?

359
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,447
None of your business. Buh-Bye.

360
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:27,881
Melinda.

361
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:29,587
Is he gonna be all right?

362
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,784
Zenorex prescribed
to steven sinclair.

363
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:34,534
Yeah, this is good news, actually.

364
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:35,886
It's an antidepressant.

365
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,959
He'd have to take a lot
of these to be fatal.

366
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,605
This guy just try to kill himself?

367
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,431
His daughter put it in his drink.

368
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:44,358
What? It wasn't really her, ok?

369
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:46,418
There's 2 ghosts in the house,
and they're trying to control them.

370
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,926
Wait. There are 2 ghosts
- What, they're possessed?

371
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:51,343
It's called oppression. They lived
here before. It's a long story.

372
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,716
Wait. You always say houses
aren't haunted, people-

373
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,442
Ok, just
- All right.

374
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:58,297
Well, do we call the cops?

375
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:00,303
Not yet. As long as they're
out of the house, they're safe,

376
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,575
And they don't even
remember what happened.

377
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:04,328
I just can't let this little
girl get taken away from her dad.

378
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:05,304
All right.

379
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,773
Ok, will you just keep
an eye on him for me?

380
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:08,176
I'll do what i can,

381
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,278
But i think they're only
gonna keep steven overnight.

382
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,359
I have to figure out who these
ghosts are and what they want.

383
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,307
Right.

384
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,347
Hey. Yeah?

385
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,088
You call me if anything changes?

386
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,046
You know it.

387
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:24,325
It was a man and a woman.

388
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,905
The woman is slightly
older than him.

389
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,488
It's not marlo's mother?

390
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:30,130
No. I don't think they're
connected to the family at all.

391
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,512
They might be
connected to the house.

392
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,581
But i thought you said places
aren't haunted, and people are.

393
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:34,454
All right, shush.

394
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:38,314
Hey, wait a minute.
You got steve and marlo

395
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,826
Out of the house.
That's a positive thing.

396
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,907
Except for the fact that marlo
practically killed her father.

397
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,640
Less positive, i admit.

398
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,560
Look, these oppressive ghosts, they're
stubborn. They're very powerful.

399
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,131
Powerful enough to survive
more than one owner,

400
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:51,631
Which is probably why the house
is haunted, and not the people.

401
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,024
Touché. All right.

402
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:57,876
So you said that these ghosts are treating
it all like it's some kind of a game?

403
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,225
Yeah. Like a contest.

404
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:00,484
What is it, the newlydead game?

405
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,446
That was good. I just made that up.

406
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:05,364
All right, what's the
point of their game,

407
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,980
Last ghost out of the house wins?

408
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,515
Last man standing. Steve and
marlo are the game pieces.

409
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,247
Why don't you just figure
out what their names are,

410
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,618
Figure out how to play, and
beat them at their own game

411
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:14,794
And get them to cross over?

412
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,287
Don't make it sound so easy.

413
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,866
Maybe i already have a name.

414
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:23,139
You said that steve
signed a tax form-Sorry.

415
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,582
He did? Oh, there you are.

416
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,564
When you went down
there. Can i see it?

417
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:28,484
Uh, why? Why-Why do you need to?

418
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,670
Please. I just need to see it.

419
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:33,562
Is it something
about his handwriting?

420
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:38,545
Okget ready to think
of a rational reason.

421
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:39,475
For what?

422
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:43,029
Why steve sinclair signed his
name as "matthew sembrook. "

423
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:50,962
You know, i don't get it.

424
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,843
Why would steve sign
somebody else's name?

425
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,925
Because that's who he thinks he is.

426
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,102
Here. Look.

427
00:21:57,111 --> 00:22:00,301
"Matthew sembrook with father
erwin and mother vivian. "

428
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,940
Mother? She looks 10
years older than him.

429
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:05,508
Matt is erwin's son
from a previous marriage.

430
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:06,972
He was vivian's stepson.

431
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,190
It says here that matthew and
vivian died of natural gas poisoning.

432
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,353
What happened to erwin
sembrook? Where's he?

433
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,388
Dead, 6 months before.

434
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,178
Apparently, erwin died in an accident
shortly after marrying vivian,

435
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,716
So mother and son inherited
the house and the fortune.

436
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,613
So you're saying that these two,

437
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:27,623
Matthew and vivian, are
haunting the sinclairs?

438
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:29,758
Not only haunting them,
but controlling them,

439
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,062
Which i'm sure is what they did with
everyone else who lived in that house.

440
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:35,683
Well, their death, what happened?

441
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,801
Was it an accident, a suicide?

442
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,016
What does the article say?

443
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,943
Well, it says here that there
are unanswered questions.

444
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,983
Well, is there something
i can do to help?

445
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,289
Would you really want to?

446
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,765
Look. You're right.

447
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,342
I don't know why,

448
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:56,312
But there is just some default
switch that goes off inside my head,

449
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:59,503
And it always resets
to "that can't be. "

450
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,325
Well, maybe it can be.

451
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:04,743
Ok.

452
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,615
Maybe it can.

453
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,286
I just don't want to
feel like i'm hurting you

454
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:11,629
Every time that i question it.

455
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,118
It has nothing to
do with hurting me.

456
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,356
I just hate to see
you so closed off.

457
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,009
I mean, there are tons of things
in life that we take on faith,

458
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,335
That we can't see. Why can't
you do that with spirits?

459
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:26,575
I can.

460
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:30,256
I will.

461
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,527
I'm gonna try.

462
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:36,455
But if i can't-

463
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:37,706
I'm sorry.

464
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:39,921
Jim.

465
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:41,827
Mel, steve's being released
from the hospital tonight.

466
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,665
He's signing himself
out, goin' home.

467
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:50,667
I know who you are.

468
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,989
Matthew and vivian sembrook.

469
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:02,917
You like to play games?

470
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:04,844
So do i.

471
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,717
Let's see how you do with
someone you don't control.

472
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,292
Not so easy keeping up the energy

473
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:17,835
When the sinclairs are gone, is it?

474
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,046
Oh, you'll do.

475
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,132
You both need to cross over.

476
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:22,924
No, thanks. We're good here.

477
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,493
Ok. Then i'll play you for it.

478
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,328
For what?

479
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:31,088
A crossover.

480
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,660
20 questions.

481
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,310
If i can tell you what
happened when you lived here,

482
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:36,421
Then you have to cross over.

483
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:39,010
And if you don't guess?

484
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:41,886
I'll never bother you again.

485
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,095
Really? That is so stupid.

486
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,618
You don't bothers at all.

487
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:47,514
You mean nothing to us.

488
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:50,392
I like it.

489
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,274
Let's do it.

490
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,072
What were you doing when i
first saw you in the garage?

491
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,580
I never saw you in the garage.

492
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,147
Are you sure you want to
count that as a question?

493
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:03,719
Your late huand died in
this house, didn't he?

494
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:05,313
Yes.

495
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,459
And you were both here that night?

496
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:07,916
Yes.

497
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:09,937
And you feel guilty
about what happened?

498
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:13,105
Just like you feel guilty
about a few things, don't you?

499
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,817
About someone in particular, maybe?

500
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,515
I'm asking the questions.

501
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,438
That's right, andrea, you are.

502
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:20,840
What?

503
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,790
I'm sorry. Did i call you
by someone else's name?

504
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:26,312
Did you kill your husband?

505
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,647
You want to know what
happened that night?

506
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,370
Come.

507
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,220
Vivian, mathew, are you up ther?

508
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:10,858
How can you do this?

509
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:12,390
He's my son!

510
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:13,751
He's not my son.

511
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:15,820
He does something you never do,

512
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:17,014
Pays attention to me.

513
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,452
Vivian, wait.

514
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:23,410
And you! What kind
of a man are you?

515
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,404
A man raised by you.

516
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:28,089
Don't you turn your back on me!

517
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,748
Look, it was an accident.

518
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:40,616
Ok, i just saw it.
He missed a step,

519
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,293
So you don't have
to blame yourself.

520
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,382
You guys can forgive each other.

521
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:47,573
And your dad, he's gonna
be in the light, ok?

522
00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:48,593
He'll forgive you.

523
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,351
Wow. She did it.

524
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,181
She wins the game.

525
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,849
So now you can cross over

526
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,252
And you can leave
the sinclairs alone.

527
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:04,052
Wait. There was one more thing.

528
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,248
Why?

529
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,555
Why?

530
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,292
Stop it!

531
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:48,173
You killed him.

532
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:51,307
Yeah, sorry. It's just that...

533
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,951
Well, we're really
not very nice people.

534
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,174
Melinda, what-What are
you still doing here?

535
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:09,457
I'll explain later, ok, but
we have to get out ofere.

536
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:11,205
Now, you can just come a
- And stay with me,

537
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,436
But you have to get out
of this house right now.

538
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:15,953
Ok, let's go.

539
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:17,051
Ok.

540
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,614
Don't be a sore loser.

541
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,427
And leave us the hell alone.

542
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,645
Steve, please don't do this.

543
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,048
Who are you?

544
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:12,588
Are you liz sinclair?

545
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:17,099
Are matt and vivian stopping
you from going in the house?

546
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,722
I'm too weak.

547
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,381
They're too strong for me.

548
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,003
They're only strong
'cause they've spent years

549
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,847
Feeding off of other people's fear,

550
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:30,068
Playing their little games.

551
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,321
Did steve cause your death?

552
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,725
Yes.

553
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:38,823
But he had to.

554
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:40,502
Why?

555
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,534
The alternative would
have been even worse.

556
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,542
I think that steve's guilt

557
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,588
Is what's allowing matt and vivian
to have so much power over them.

558
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:53,196
It's not just steve's guilt.

559
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,946
What?

560
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,203
It's marlo, too.

561
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,779
He will always blame you.

562
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,469
Every time he looks at
you, he sees his dead wife.

563
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,155
Do you know what that does to him?

564
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,652
There's really only
one way to end this,

565
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,934
All this pain, all this anger.

566
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,313
You know what it is.

567
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,600
You know what you have to do

568
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:33,165
For your own protection.

569
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,579
You know what you have to do

570
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,439
To make sure you both get peace.

571
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:30,823
It's the best thing
for both of you.

572
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,645
It only hurts for a
second. You'll barely know,

573
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,831
And then you'll both
finally have some peace.

574
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,071
Don't listen to her.
Ok, this is not you.

575
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,545
This is a ghost that's
making you feel these things.

576
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:40,635
What?

577
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:41,814
This is what you do, isn't it?

578
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,613
You just play your story
over and over again,

579
00:31:44,631 --> 00:31:46,010
Except it's a new person each te,

580
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,151
But your real story

581
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,812
Is that you were so guilty
about killing your husband

582
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,890
That you killed yourselves.

583
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:54,373
Looks and brains. I'm impressed.

584
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,722
The newspapers keep saying that
it's-It's poisoning from natural gas.

585
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,142
It's a little more complicated
than that, isn't it?

586
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,850
A bit.

587
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:14,658
And it wasn't about guilt either.

588
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:21,477
The thing is matt and i always
thought we were a perfect match,

589
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,474
Because neither one of us
had a shred of conscience.

590
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:26,084
Oh, it was just delicious.

591
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,715
The problem is that when you realize the
man you love is as dangerous as you are...

592
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,990
Let's just say it's
not a trust builder.

593
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,101
Attraction turns to suspicion.

594
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,480
There was a lot of money at stake.

595
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,782
Erwin had left us
both very well off.

596
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:58,705
So i started to wonder

597
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,944
Was matthew's devotion real,

598
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,843
Or did he really want
all that money to himself,

599
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,445
And what would he be willing to do?

600
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,715
He already knew what
i was willing to do,

601
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:14,315
And i'm sure he was having
the same thoughts about me.

602
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:17,741
Which is why i decided

603
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,441
That the best thing
for our relationship

604
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:23,447
Was for matt to have a
tragic, careless accident.

605
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,573
Control freak that i am, i wanted
to make sure that he fell asleep,

606
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,336
As it were, before
i left the house.

607
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,273
He was always so restless.

608
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:37,880
Imagine my surprise when i
fell asleep before he did.

609
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,399
Very sneaky stuff, natural gas.

610
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:44,807
Turns out i was much more
sensitive to it than he was.

611
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:47,554
Of course, matt
followed soon after.

612
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,334
Then we woke up, and we were dead,

613
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:05,002
And we've been here
having a blast ever since.

614
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,772
What? What is going on?

615
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,794
I'm gonna get you out
of this house right now.

616
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:21,896
We'll get your father.

617
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:26,938
I vote for my guy. He's
gonna go all the way.

618
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,307
You should have behaved.

619
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:30,355
What are you going to do?

620
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:31,956
Don't count my girl out.

621
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,241
Both of you just stop it.

622
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:36,001
This is family business.

623
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,763
You should have left us alone.

624
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:41,585
Too late now.

625
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:52,226
Steve, please stop, ok?

626
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,196
I've seen your wife.
I've seen her spirit.

627
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,566
My wife is dead.

628
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,641
You should know.

629
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,233
You killed her. Me?

630
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,855
If it wasn't for you,
she'd still be alive.

631
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:03,046
You let go!

632
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,386
You didn't listen to me!

633
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,222
Now that's entertainment.

634
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,876
Come on. Come on.

635
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:14,846
What's happening?

636
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,755
Just trust me. I'm
taking you to your mother.

637
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:22,920
Wait, waitwait!

638
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:25,081
What are you-What are
you saying about my mom?

639
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:28,298
Tell her i'm sorry that
it's been so hard on them.

640
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:31,045
Your mom is here with us.

641
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:32,993
I can see her.

642
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:38,025
Tell her i miss our nightly ritual

643
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,367
Of brushing each other's hair,

644
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:42,941
Her beautiful hair that she
got from her grandmother.

645
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:45,155
She misses brushing
each other's hair.

646
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:53,945
Dad, uh, she says mom's here,

647
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:56,878
Her-Her spirit or-Or
ghost or something,

648
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,213
And she wants to help.

649
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:00,310
What-What are you talking about?

650
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:02,413
That shirt he's
wearing is my favorite,

651
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,448
Because he wore it
when marlo was born.

652
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:05,859
She remembers your shirt.

653
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,806
You were wearing it the
day that marlo was born.

654
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,121
She said that?

655
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:18,276
She's really here?

656
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:23,255
They have to stop
punishing themselves.

657
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,454
She wants you to stop
punishing each other.

658
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm so sorry, mom.

659
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:38,841
Dad's right. If it wasn't for me, i
- No.

660
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:40,409
It's all my fault, and-

661
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,285
No. It was me.

662
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:44,524
It was me.

663
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:47,705
I made the decision. It was me.

664
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:51,370
What happened that day?

665
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:55,111
We were so tired.

666
00:36:58,025 --> 00:36:59,669
We'd been on that trail all day.

667
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:02,074
Watch my moves.

668
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,217
Oh. Hey, look!

669
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,455
It happened so fast.

670
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,192
Aah! Liz!

671
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,205
No!

672
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:23,245
One second, she was next to me.

673
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,871
The next, she was
hanging off a cliff.

674
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:31,312
I was trying to pull her up,
but i couldn't get any traction.

675
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:36,624
Mom! No!

676
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,349
Dad! Stay there!

677
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,425
And that's when it all fell apart.

678
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:47,090
I knew i couldn't stop marlo.

679
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,775
How can you stop a child from
trying to save her mother?

680
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,824
Mom! Aah!

681
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,284
Marlo was falling.

682
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,369
She was gonna die.

683
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,478
I couldn't get liz
back on the ledge.

684
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:10,449
I thought there was
only one way to save her.

685
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:27,798
I let go of liz,

686
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,472
And i grabbed ahold of marlo.

687
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:35,460
Mom! Liz!

688
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:40,745
I'm so sorry.

689
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:43,724
I should have tried
to save you both.

690
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:47,724
No. No, he couldn't.

691
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,024
He did what i wanted him to do,

692
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,424
The only thing that he could do.

693
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:53,824
You did everything that
she wanted you to do.

694
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:54,699
You saved marlo.

695
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:02,374
And i know you were
trying to save me.

696
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,319
She risked her life for me.

697
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,390
She doesn't blame you.

698
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:16,219
She was really proud of you.

699
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,189
I'm so sorry, mom.

700
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,488
I don't know how to do
any of this without you.

701
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:29,284
You will always have me
with you in your heart,

702
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:32,739
But most importantly,
you have each other.

703
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:37,269
They've gotta stop
punishing themselves.

704
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:40,158
Please tell them that
we'll always be a family,

705
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,328
And they have to take
care of each other.

706
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:45,239
I will.

707
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:55,921
I have to go now.

708
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:07,108
She crossed over.

709
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:11,293
Is she gonna be ok?

710
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:15,609
She was smiling, at peace.

711
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:20,703
She's always gonna
be in your heart.

712
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:34,298
How come i don't feel anything
bad when i go inside now?

713
00:40:34,923 --> 00:40:37,778
They can't feed off your
guilt anymore. They're weak.

714
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:42,708
How can i sell this house to
somebody knowing what i know?

715
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,740
I'll come back, cross them over.

716
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,823
Don't worry about it. You
two just get a fresh start.

717
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:49,663
I cannot thank you enough.

718
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:50,978
Me, too.

719
00:40:54,873 --> 00:40:56,023
Things'll get better
now. You'll see.

720
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,723
Would you mind checking
marlo into the hotel?

721
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:01,123
I just need to grab
a few more things.

722
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,023
Sure. Come on.

723
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,888
Only one way to be sure
things'll get better.

724
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,468
Well played.

725
00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:43,127
My dad!

726
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,211
Fresh start.

727
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:27,123
Hi, mel.

728
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,308
Jim, you'd better get the fire
department to the sinclair house.

729
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,477
Steve did the only thing
he thought he could do.

730
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,042
What will we do?

731
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:37,602
What if nobody else comes?

732
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,622
This is our home, the-The
place where we met.

733
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:41,222
We can't leave.

734
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:42,817
Don't worry. Somebody always comes.

735
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:44,547
They'll build.
They'll buy and sell.

736
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:47,041
All we have to do is wait.

737
00:42:49,072 --> 00:42:50,102
What do we do in the meantime?

738
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:52,296
How 'bout a game?

739
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,322
20 questions?

740
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:56,042
You're on.

741
00:42:57,272 --> 00:42:59,322
Ok. Oh, i got a good one.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

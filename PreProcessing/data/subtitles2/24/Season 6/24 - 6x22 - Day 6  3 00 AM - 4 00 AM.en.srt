1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,300


2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,000


3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300


4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,700
Previously on 24

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,000
You didn't just betray me.
You betrayed your country.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
I swear to you I didn't know.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,100
But the russians know about the component.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,600
And they're threatening military action against us
if we don't get it back from the chinese.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,900
You're going to go back to your boyfriend

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
and you're going to make him believe
that we have the component back.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,900
When you go back to mr. Bishop you will find a way
to excuse yourself from the room.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
To allow him time to access your pda.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,800
If you can feed all this convincingly to bishop,
he will relay it to his russian contact,

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,600
president suvarov will call off
his threat of military action.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
I think I know how to take your mind off of it.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,300
Head east, 153 meters.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
That will put you directly beneath ctu.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,100
This is nadia yassir, code red.
It is confirmed,look this place down.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,900
Everyone on the floor!

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,700
-you all right?
-Yes, jack.What's going on?

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,500
What do they want with josh?

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you mean josh?

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
They came here to get him.

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,800
-I'm not leaving you.
-Josh, you're not leaving anyo behind,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,900
we're gonna be following you.
Just go through here.Go. Keep going.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,700
Put your weapon down on the ground. Now!

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm putting the weapon down.

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,500
-The boy's escaped.
-Get the boy back.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't care what you have to do.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Josh, I'm going to give you ten seconds.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,300
If you don't show yourself by the time I finish counting,she dies.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,700
The operation was successful,my men have your grandson.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,700
Call me when i can talk to the boy.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,300
-Have you finished repairing the sub-circut board?
-Almost.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Who's in command?

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200


39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,100
I am.Milo pressman.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm acting director of ctu.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,000
The following takes place between 3:00 am and 4:00 am.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,300
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Get him into the tunnel, now.

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,400
Josh!Josh!Josh. No!Josh.

45
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop it.What are you gonna do,what do you...

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,700
-no!
-Marilyn.Marilyn!

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,900
What do you want with him?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Please, let me...they're taking my child.
Please!

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,700
Leave her alone!

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
he's just a boy. He'S...he's just a boy...

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
-shut up!
-Wait!Please!

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,300
I can help you calm her down.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,700
Please, let me just help you.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Get on your feet!

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,200
-Keep her quiet!
-Thank you.Thank you.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,700
Marilyn.Marilyn

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,300
All of you,listen to me.Pay attention.

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,900
We're moving you to a secure room then we will leave.

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,400
Do what I tell you to do and no one will be hurt.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Come on.

61
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,500
we're moving you in two groups.
Group one, on your feeT.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are they doing?

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
They got what they want.

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
Now they want to stop us from
being able to follow them.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
We're going to try to get josh back.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
marilyn, I need you to be at the front of
our group.Do you understand me?

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,300
You need to be in the front of our group.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,100
Group two, on your feet!

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,500
ok,stand up.

70
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Marilyn, go.

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,100
Nadia.If cheng's men  lock us in the holding room,

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,000
we're gonna lose our only chance
to get that component back.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
-So we have to do something now.
-Yeah.

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,900
But you need to understand,it's a long shot at best...

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,300
there's a good chance we won't make it through this.

76
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
I understand.

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,200
Stay close to me.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
As soon as I make my move take the first man on the left.

79
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
-Okay.
-What are you guys talking about?

80
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
Chloe, keep going.

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
Morris, stay alert.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,500
-are you all right?
-Yeah.

83
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
-Teams b and c,do we have the hostages secured?
-Yes, sir. All secure.

84
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,900
-they were cheng's men that attacked us.
-They were after my nephew.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,600
I don't know why,but it has to do something with the component,

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,300
otherwise why would they take the risk?

87
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,400
All I need is a tactical set up
and comm and I'm ready to go.

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
-You're still under arrest, jack.
-Nadia, please.

89
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,200
I know the schematics of this building
better than anyone,I can find them.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,200
-Okay, I'll release you,jack, but doyle's in command.
-Fine.

91
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
-Give him whatever he needs.
-yes

92
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
How many casualties did you sustain?

93
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
One.

94
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,200
Milo pressman.

95
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,000
-Are you okay?
-No.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm set,we need to go.

97
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Use my cell until comm's up.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
You did great.

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,400
**move,let's go.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,900
That was really brave.

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,000
I need to restore comm and satellite immediately.

102
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,400
There may be more server capacity in data storage.

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
Try it.

104
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
keep***

105
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,100
climb up.Let's go.

106
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,000
-Hello, josh.
-Who are you?

107
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,600
Start loading,we're moving out.

108
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,100
What do you want from me?

109
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
What took so long?
I've been waiting for your call.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,600
-I have the boy with me.
-Put him on the phone.

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Your grandfather wants to speak with you.

112
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
-My grandfather?
-Yes.

113
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Take the phone.

114
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
Grandpa?

115
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,200
Hello, joshua.

116
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,200
Look...I'm sorry, i know you've been through a lot.

117
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,900
I'm sorry?

118
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,900
A few hours ago you pointed a gun at my head
and said you'd kill me.

119
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
-I never would have hurt you.
-I heard you say it!

120
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I had to make it sound convincing...
to you and to jack.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten away.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,500
But I wouldn't hurt you.Not for anything.

123
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
This way.

124
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,100
-What do you want from me?
-To protect you.

125
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
From what?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,000
From your father's mistakes.

127
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,900
If you stay here...

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,900
they'll never let you forget what your father did.

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.

130
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,400
-Some place we can both start over.
-Where?

131
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
China.

132
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Within a decade,they will have surpassed
this country in every possible way.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
And we can be part of it, josh.

134
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,500
I am going to give you the future
I promised you when you were born.

135
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

136
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,500
No, I didn't think you would.

137
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,100
But you will.

138
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
I'll explain everything when I see you.

139
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,400
Right now, all i need is for you to keep an open mind.

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Let's go.

141
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
No, wait, please!I don't want to be with my grandpa.

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,300
-I'm afraid of him.
-Your grandfather's a visionary--

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,200
you should be grateful for the opportunity.

144
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,500
I don't want to be with him, though!

145
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,900
go, go, go, go,go, go, go, go, go!

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,100
Cheng's using the boy as a shield--
hold your fire!Hold your fire!

147
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,200
I've got two hostiles at the suv!
Cover me now!

148
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,840
Go,go,go,go!move!

149
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,810
This is bauer.I've got one hostile down.
We're moving towards the roof.

150
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,450
Go!Go!Go!

151
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,090
ÎÒÀ´***

152
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,420
Cheng,it's over!

153
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,470
Put your weapon down!Now!

154
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,140
Put it down!

155
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,430
Where is the boy?!

156
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,310
Tell me where the boy is,and I won't kill you.

157
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,020
- Help!
- Josh!

158
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,760
- Help!
- Josh...

159
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,920
- Help
-Hold on

160
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,500
Josh...here,you need to grab my arm.

161
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,980
Do it now.Now!Now!

162
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,290
- You okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,320
Mike,it's jack.I'm on the roof.

164
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,490
I lost cheng,but I've got josh.

165
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,430
I need to secure him.

166
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
On our way up now.

167
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,150
We're setting up a perimeter around the building.

168
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,580
Josh,the man who had you,his name was cheng.

169
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,320
Did he explain why he tried to take you?

170
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,720
No,but he made me talk on the phone with grandpa.

171
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
He did?

172
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,600
- You talked to your grandfather?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,330
What'd he say?

174
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,170
He said that he loved me,that he wanted to
take me to china and that I was his legacy.

175
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,840
I think he's out of his mind.

176
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,240
Josh,listen to me,I need your help.

177
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,190
Was there anything that you might have heard
that could help us figure out where your grandfather is?

178
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,050
- No.
- Josh,think.

179
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,470
I don't know.I'm sorry.I'm sorry...

180
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,410
josh,no.Hey,hey,it's all right.

181
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,690
It's all right.

182
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,690
Come on,let's get you back to your mom.

183
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,620
Jack!

184
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,440
Ctu has a team on the way to secure the area.

185
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,200
You need to let them know my father's
still involved in this.

186
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,140
Your father's involved with the chinese?Why?

187
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,450
I don't know.I'll ask him when I find him.

188
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,160
- Sir?
- Come in,karen.

189
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,590
I just got off the phone with the pentagon,

190
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,160
and the latest intel indicates that
the russians are moving

191
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,110
another two mechanized divisions into
the central asian theater.

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,580
- Are they within striki distance of our base?
- Yes.

193
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,710
And the troops are at the highest level of alert.

194
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,970
Sir,tom lennox was supposed
to be on the call with me,

195
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,810
and I couldn't find him or
get him on the telephone.

196
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,230
Is there something that I should know about?

197
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,400
Tom is out in the field running
a classified operation.

198
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,060
He figured out who the leak was.

199
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,840
- Who?
- Lisa miller

200
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,430
- Lisa miller is spying for the russians?
- No.

201
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,550
The man lisa is romantically involved with is.

202
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,770
For the last year,this man,mark bishop's been
passing lisa's e-mails along to the russians,

203
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,370
along with other things that...

204
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,120
she told him in confidence.

205
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,980
And that's how the russians knew
the chinese had the component.

206
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,050
- Does lisa know?
- She does now.

207
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,730
Tom sent her back to this man,
bishop,with a cover story

208
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,350
and falsified e-mails that
we hope will convince the russians

209
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,100
that we've destroyed the circuit board before
the chinese could get it out of the country,

210
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,580
and with any luck,
bishop'll forward those e-mails to the russians

211
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,190
and they'll back off.

212
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,610
And we'll have bought time to
actually retrieve the...

213
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,660
component from the chinese.

214
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,180
Well,I hope that works,sir.

215
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,520
Karen.Sit down.

216
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,810
I know you're wondering why
you've been kept out of the loop on this,

217
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,730
so let me assure you it had nothing to do with
you and everything to do with me.

218
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,100
I don'T...I don't understand.

219
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,590
At the same time lisa was...

220
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,010
with bishop,she and I were...

221
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,820
in a relationship as well.

222
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,890
Needless to say...

223
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,070
I am ashamed.

224
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,740
Well...sir,I...

225
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,040
I think you're being a little hard on yourself.

226
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,080
You and lisa were both single,and...

227
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,680
there's no way you could know what
she was doing behind your back.

228
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,990
It's a question of judgment.

229
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,120
I trusted her.

230
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,050
And unless tom's plan succeeds...

231
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,870
that mistake will bring us to war.

232
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,510
and finally we're done.Here we go.

233
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,830
You okay?

234
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,140
I'm great.That was great.

235
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,760
It felt like you were somewhere else.

236
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,400
I'm just tired.

237
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,870
It's been a long day.

238
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,500
I'll be right back.

239
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,860
Do you think he's just concerned or...suspicious?

240
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,750
Yeah,I don't know.

241
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,180
But she is leaving him alone with the pda.

242
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,070
This could be it.

243
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,960
He's making his move,he's making his move.

244
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,690
Is that excellent?

245
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,470
That must be the device he's using to
forward the e-mails to the russians.

246
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,740
GentlemeN...he is taking the bait.

247
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,200
Come on.Come on.There you go.

248
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,200
Come on,come on,come on.
Send these e-mails.Come on.

249
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,520
He's not going to,sir.

250
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,970
He's putting her pda away.

251
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Sweetheart,I'm just gonna pour
myself a glass of wine.

252
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,760
- You want something?
- Sure.I'll have what you're having.

253
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,970
You know,I don't think it's just
that you're tired.

254
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,020
What are you talking about?

255
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,560
I can tell from the way you were in bed
that something's wrong.

256
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,240
All right,we have a problem here.

257
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,160
I told you everything's fine.

258
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,030
Then why can't you look me in the eye?

259
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,860
Because you're making me nervous
staring at me like that?

260
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,930
Can we stop talking about this?

261
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,450
- Mark...
- I know you.

262
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,230
- You don't get nervous.
- Stop it.You're hurting me.

263
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,830
- What's going on?!
- Nothing's going on!

264
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,510
- You're lying!
- I'm not lying!

265
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,730
Tell me what's going on!

266
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,760
All right,this is not good.

267
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,730
All right,I'll tell you what's going on.

268
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,160
- What's going on you're a lying son of a bitch!
- We got to get in there quick!Come on!

269
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,250
I put myself on the line for you and all you were
doing was whoring yourself to the russians,

270
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,260
stealing my e-mail,you bastard!

271
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,640
Bitch!

272
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,120
They're gonna charge me with treason!
I'll be put in jail!

273
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,970
who knows about me and the russians?!Who knows?!

274
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,270
Freeze!Get him off her!

275
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,650
Put Mr. Bishop in the bedroom.

276
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,250
She's got a pulse.It's faint.

277
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,980
She's breathing.

278
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,020
All right,let's get an ambulance here fast.

279
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,730
Mr. Bishop,I'm tom lennox.

280
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,920
I would guess you've already familiarized
yourself with the white house staff.

281
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,030
If I could have a moment alone with the prisoner?

282
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,540
Mr. Bishop,we have incontrovertible evidence
you were spying for the russians.

283
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,180
We have recordings of you on the phone
with the agent running you,

284
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,890
and now,of course,we've got this.

285
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,390
Do I have your attention?

286
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,090
All right.So here it is.

287
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,810
You are going to upload the e-mails
on Ms. Miller's pda

288
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,500
to your russian employers.

289
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,200
Additionally,you are going to call your handler

290
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,860
and back up the story these e-mails tell

291
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,850
namely,that our country destroyed the circuit board
before it could fall into chinese hands.

292
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,100
Now,if you comply,
we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.

293
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,890
If you do not,I can all but
guarantee you the death penalty.

294
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,910
- what is it,cheng?
- I lost the boy.

295
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,020
- Who has him?
- Ctu and your son.

296
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,930
This is totally unacceptable.

297
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,750
The boy was my price for repairing
the circuit board.

298
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,890
I lost many men trying to give
you your price,Mr. Bauer!

299
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,840
I really don't give a damn about
your operational incapacities.

300
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,380
- Our arrangement is over.
- It cannot be over.

301
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,320
You have our component.

302
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,880
You failed to hold up your end of the deal.

303
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,220
The circuit board is no longer yours.

304
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,540
You repair the circuit board and return it to us
or there'll be serious consequences!

305
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,390
Now you listen to me.

306
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm not afraid of you,cheng.

307
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,150
And the next time you threaten me,
the consequences will be serious

308
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,250
but not for me.

309
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,440
×ß

310
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,890
Any luck?

311
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,270
Chloe,have our teams been able to locate cheng
or the sub-circuit board?

312
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,740
No,nothing yet.

313
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,150
What's the status on our satellite?

314
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,010
We managed to reroute circuits through an undamaged subsystem.

315
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,140
We should have the gd back up in ten minutes.

316
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,460
Try to make it five.

317
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,020
Nadia yassir?

318
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,390
Yeah,can I help you?

319
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,740
My name is ben kram,I'm from division.

320
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,110
You should have received a flash memo alerting you of my arrival.

321
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,130
Well,our systems are still down so we can't receive memos just yet.

322
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,690
That's exactly why I'm here.

323
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,340
I've been authorized to compile an accounting
and assessment of your security breach.

324
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,220
Well,sir,we're right in the middle of a recovery operation
and it's 3:00 in the morning.

325
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,170
I mean,this isn't the best time to be questioning my people.

326
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,860
Frankly,Ms. Yassir,I don't particularly care what you think.

327
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,130
Excuse me?

328
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,980
This incident represents a serious breach in your security protocols,

329
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,300
one which resulted in a loss of ctu personnel.

330
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,450
Obviously,mistakes were made; errors in judgment.

331
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,530
Not the least of which was my accepting bill buchanan's recommendation

332
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,470
to leave someone with your limited experience in charge.

333
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,730
So,can I,uh,count on your full cooperation or not?

334
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,070
I never said otherwise.

335
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,040
Super.

336
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,300
I'll need a full staff roster and access to

337
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,590
all departments plus some kind of a station to set up my investigation.

338
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,420
You can work out of that conference room over there.

339
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
Thank you.

340
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,020
Yeah,this is nadia yassir.

341
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
There is a group from division here in conference room "B.¡±

342
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,310
Please give them whatever it is that they need.

343
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,730
Nadia.

344
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,250
Yeah,morris?

345
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,340
This may not be my place,
don't let those buggers from division get to you.

346
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,690
You're not responsible for what happened.

347
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,730
Of course I'm responsible.

348
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,300
It happened on my watch.

349
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,140
There's nothing you could have done.

350
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,630
Do not let them hang you out to dry.

351
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,390
No,morris,people are dead.

352
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,960
Milo is dead because of me.

353
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,410
That's ridiculous.

354
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,730
There's nothing anyone could have done,darling.

355
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,770
No,I...I could have stood up.

356
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,040
I could have said something.

357
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,600
There was no time.

358
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,540
Milo jumped in.

359
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,720
There was time.

360
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,630
I just hesitated.

361
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,030
I was just...

362
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,240
you were just afraid?

363
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,040
Yeah,I have a bit of experience with that.

364
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,960
Look,I'm not one to give advice on
how to handle self-recrimination,

365
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,060
but I know this: Milo was a brave man.

366
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,570
He never would have sacrificed himself

367
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,070
if he knew you could allow others to lay his death at your feet.

368
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,010
He'd want you to stay strong,stay in charge.

369
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,130
Sir,tom lennox is on the line for you.

370
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,530
Thanks.

371
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,880
Tom,I'm here with karen.

372
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,590
Yes,sir,that information we planted for the russians,

373
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,560
that has been sent on to bishop's contact.

374
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,730
Good.

375
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,550
Do you think it's made its way to suvarov yet?

376
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,950
I'm confident it has,sir.

377
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
But I do think a call to the russian president
giving him the news ourselves,

378
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,710
that might well strengthen the credibility of our story here.

379
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,100
I agree.

380
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,290
Tom,thanks.

381
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,850
Uh,sir,there is one other thing.

382
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,810
What's that?

383
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,830
We had some complications,and,uh,
lisa was injured in the operation.

384
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,720
How badly?

385
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,820
Well,she experienced a loss of oxygen to the brain.

386
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,770
Won't know the extent of the damage
till she regains consciousness.

387
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,590
She is on her way to the hospital.

388
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,600
How the hell did this happen?

389
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,560
Sir,she attacked bishop suddenly
before we could even get in there.

390
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,730
He almost strangled her to death.

391
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,260
And what were you doing during all this?

392
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,610
You were supposed to be watching her the whole time!

393
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
Where was secret service?

394
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,220
Sir,we did everything we could.

395
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,110
It just happened too fast.

396
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,950
All right,thank you,tom.

397
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,170
All right,I'll be back there shortly.

398
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,080
I'm so sorry,sir.

399
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,920
I know that despite her betrayal,
you still have feelings for lisa.

400
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Unfortunately,we do have a pressing matter to address.

401
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,240
suvarov.

402
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,080
Yes,sir,we've got to call him immediately
and tell him that the chinese no longer have the component

403
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,250
and that it has been destroyed.

404
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,210
Set it up in the telepresence suite.

405
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,690
Right away,sir.

406
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm gonna get you back to your mom soon,okay?

407
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,680
Just sit here.

408
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,410
I'll be right back.

409
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,700
- ctu
- This is jack.

410
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,190
- Patch me through to marilyn bauer's cell phone.
- Yes,sir.

411
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,850
Jack,ground teams have done a thorough search
of the area and cheng's vehicles.

412
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,240
The sub circuit board's not here.

413
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,510
What about aerial surveillance?

414
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,480
The choppers have picked up nothing
and we just now got satellite back online.

415
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,930
It looks like cheng got out.

416
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,000
There's nothing more we can do here.

417
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,310
- Get your men ready. We'll go back to ctu.
- got it

418
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,330
- Hello?
- Hey,it's me.

419
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,700
Did they tell you josh was safe?

420
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,430
Yeah,but that's all they'll tell me.

421
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,260
What's going on?

422
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,220
When can I see him?

423
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,700
We should be back at ctu in the next few minutes.

424
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,050
Marilyn,the chinese were doing this for my father.

425
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,230
They were trying to get josh to him.

426
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,240
Are you sure?

427
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,370
Yeah,josh spoke to him.

428
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,250
What did he tell josh?

429
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,940
He said he wanted to take him back to china,
that josh was his legacy.

430
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,300
That's it? That's all he said?

431
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,690
Yeah.

432
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,500
Can I talk to him?

433
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,220
Of course. Hold on one second.

434
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,260
Hey,it's your mom.

435
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,380
- Mom.
- Hey!

436
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,630
Hey,are you okay?

437
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,960
Did they hurt you?

438
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,430
No,I'm all right.

439
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,640
I don't know what i would do if I lost you.

440
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:26,180
Mom,uncle jack,he saved my life.

441
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,210
I know.

442
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,170
I love you so much.

443
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,250
I love you,too,mom.

444
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,220
I'll see you soon,all right?

445
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,550
Okay,honey.

446
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,320
You okay?

447
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,720
Come on. We need to go.

448
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,540
Sir,president suvarov is standing by for you.

449
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,010
Whenever you're ready.

450
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Let's do this.

451
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,320
President suvarov,
you have a secure conference with vice president daniels.

452
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,270
Mr. President,I have some good news to share with you.

453
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,170
And what is this good news,Mr. Vice president?

454
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,420
We were successful in locating and taking out the chinese agents

455
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,190
who were attempting to smuggle the fb sub-circuit board
out of the country.

456
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,230
Are you saying you have the component back in your possession?

457
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
No,sir.

458
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,700
The sub-circuit board was destroyed when we attacked the chinese.

459
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,080
I see.

460
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,510
I assume you have proof of this?

461
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,130
Yes,we do.

462
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,710
In addition to fragments from the destroyed component,

463
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,530
I'm prepared to give you whatever images
or documentation you need to assure

464
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,860
that this threat's been neutralized.

465
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:07,120
Do you mean the same documentation
you planted with one of my agents?

466
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,190
Excuse me?

467
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,430
The same images you coerced him into
sending to my people of a strike

468
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,130
that accomplished nothing but destroying an empty building?

469
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,650
Yes,I know you exposed one of my operatives.

470
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,700
I had him under surveillance,
which is how I know about your raid on his apartment.

471
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,380
Mr. President...

472
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,040
now,if the chinese agent in possession

473
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,080
of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government,

474
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,120
the entire russian defense system will be compromised.

475
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,060
I told you I would hold you and your government responsible.

476
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,360
I will not tolerate any threats from you,Mr. President.

477
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,470
We're doing everything in our power
to ensure this component does not reach china.

478
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,240
I have already given you ample time to recover it.

479
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,570
Now I am feeling less generous.

480
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,760
If you do not deliver complete
and irrefutable proof to our embassy

481
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,210
that you have recovered
or destroyed this component within two hours,

482
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,330
I will have no choice
but to extend my country's forward perimeter

483
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,760
to compensate for our defensive vulnerabilities.

484
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,400
You are talking about attacking one of our military bases.

485
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,210
Now I would urge you to consider the consequences of that.

486
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,980
We have just as many troops in that area and allies

487
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,900
who will not look kindly upon any unprovoked aggression on my country.

488
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,310
You and I both know it will not be unprovoked.

489
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,500
This is a matter of survival for us.

490
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,150
It is in both our interests that you get that component back.

491
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,420
You have two hours.

492
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,710
It was all for nothing.

493
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,230
Excuse me,sir?

494
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,870
This ruse,it bought us nothing.

495
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,160
We're about to go to war over a piece of circuitry.

496
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,740
this is the agenda for the vice president's
briefing with the military.

497
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,120
Okay. When did they start?

498
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,010
A few minutes ago.

499
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,240
they're in the oval office.

500
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
All right,I'll play catch up.

501
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,580
Tom lennox.

502
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,210
Who?

503
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,970
All right,put him through.

504
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,880
The russians are blaming us for allowing
the chinese theft of the fb sub-circuit board

505
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,340
and they're preparing to retaliate against us.

506
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,910
All our efforts to reacquire the component have failed,

507
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,660
so we have no choice but to defend ourselves.

508
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,060
And to make provisions for the escalation of this conflict
beyond the central asian theater.

509
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,670
excuse me,Mr. Vice president.

510
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,240
I'm glad you could make it,tom.

511
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,630
General kram is about to run some response scenarios.

512
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,650
Before we do that,sir,I need a moment alone with you and karen.

513
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,010
Excuse us,ladies and gentlemen.

514
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,580
I've got phillip bauer calling for you on a scrambled line.

515
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,860
What? What does he want?

516
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,530
I don't know.

517
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,410
But he's in league with the chinese.

518
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,350
I think we need to hear him out.

519
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,670
Put him on speaker.

520
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,330
Mr. Bauer.

521
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,880
Thank you for taking my call,Mr. Vice president.

522
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,700
What's this about?

523
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,360
I think you know what this is about.

524
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,890
Tell me anyway so there's no miscommunication.

525
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,030
I want my grandson.

526
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,040
And I want clear passage to the country of my choice.

527
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,170
You give me that,and I'll give you the fb sub-circuit board.

528
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,210
You're working with the chinese?

529
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,580
I was.

530
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,110
They had their chance,they blew it.

531
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,820
How do I know you even have this component?

532
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,190
Serial number 3ptl3.

533
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,720
Check it against any records you have.

534
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,730
And there it is,sir.

535
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,400
You realize what you're asking?

536
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding
a conflict this country does not want,

537
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,350
a war this country cannot afford.

538
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,700
Not after what's happened today.

539
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,370
I'll send my instructions on an encrypted data stream.

540
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,170
Mr. Bauer...

541
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,170
sir,you're not seriously considering this?

542
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,010
Phillip bauer is a federal fugitive...

543
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,520
complicit in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists.

544
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,940
I know what crimes he's committed.

545
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,620
Then how can you even entertain
the thought of negotiating with him?

546
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,520
Because it may be we can't afford not to.

547
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,320
We are talking about trading the life of an innocent young boy.

548
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,250
We're talking about the lives of a lot more young men
if we go to war with russia.

549
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,400
And you think phillip bauer is somebody that we can trust?

550
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,300
The man is a sociopath.

551
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,540
Tom?

552
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,520
He is a sociopatH.

553
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,180
She's right about that.

554
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,160
But given the stakes,this is a risk worth taking,sir.

555
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,330
None of this makes sense.

556
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,550
Everything we know about suvarov tells us the man
wouldn't risk military engagement,

557
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,380
even for this piece of technology.

558
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,050
Unless he's being squeezed.

559
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,110
Who by?

560
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,340
His cabinet?

561
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,020
No. The military.

562
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,890
Gredenko was not the only anti-american general left
over from the soviet regime.

563
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,410
Yes,some of them are still in power,
and suvarov does rely on them.

564
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,780
So you think these generals are just looking for
an excuse to pull the trigger.

565
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,640
Well,certainly sounds plausible,sir.

566
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,010
Well,if that is the case,then we have no choice.

567
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,950
We have to recover that stolen circuit board.

568
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,710
Get me ctu.

569
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,020
As soon as we get back to ctu,

570
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,100
you and your mother will be transported to a safe location.

571
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,530
How long will we be there?

572
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,650
Until we find your grandfather.

573
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,940
Uncle jack,when you find him,what are you going to do to him?

574
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,500
Josh,I don't want you worrying about this.

575
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,810
But I promise you,
he will never threaten you or your mother again.

576
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,980
Agent bauer!

577
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,850
Call for you. It's urgent.

578
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,250
Josh,get in the car I'll be right there.

579
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,380
Josh,you need to come with me.

580
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:01,970
What do you mean?

581
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,100
Come now!

582
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,110
Uncle jack!

583
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,430
Agent doyle!

584
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,580
Uncle jack!

585
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,700
Agent doyle!

586
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,670
Orders jack!

587
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,240
Go back to ctu!

588
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,110
The boy stays with me!

589
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,650
Get out of my way.

590
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,020
take him dowN.

591
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,450
What are you doing?!

592
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,270
Uncle jack!

593
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,050
Take him to ctu!

594
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,260
Uncle jack!

595
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,810
Josh!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:15,700
How soon can you deploy
once we arrive?

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,967
It'll take us two hours
to assemble the delivery system,

5
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,234
and another hour
to install the bomb.

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:24,034
<i>FAYED:
That's longer than I'd hoped.</i>

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,500
Just remember, without us,

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,001
you'd be delivering
your payload in weeks

9
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,600
instead of hours.

10
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:30,900
If we succeed today,

11
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:34,867
<i>the Arabs and the West</i>
will destroy each other.</i>

12
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,368
Were you able to pick up
anything on Gredenko?

13
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,401
BUCHANAN:
No.

14
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,934
The Glasgow Street house
was deserted.

15
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,201
I think I might have a lead.

16
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,234
<i>BUCHANAN:
What is it?</i>

17
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,767
<i>BAUER:
Charles Logan.</i>
Logan?</i>

18
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:44,834
<i>BUCHANAN:
He's at his retreat.</i>

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,900
<i>He's under house arrest.</i>

20
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:48,434
So you need Gredenko
to find Fayed.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,767
Can you help us?

22
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,067
I never dealt with
Gredenko directly,

23
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,700
but I know how
we can find him.

24
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,101
How?
Through
Anatoly Markov.

25
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,734
He's the Russian Consul General,
here in Los Angeles.

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,267
I don't trust you.

27
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,867
If you want to find Gredenko,
maybe it's time you started.

28
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,600
You're taking a great
risk, Mr. President.

29
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,600
You and I are both
sharing that risk, sir.

30
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,800
<i>We have three more</i>
nuclear weapons</i>

31
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,900
loose in my country.

32
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,767
I want a public statement
of support

33
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,134
from your Prime Minister.

34
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:14,234
And I want it to follow
right on the heels of Assad's.

35
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:15,401
A public
endorsement of him

36
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,267
could have grave
political consequences

37
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,301
for the Prime Minister.

38
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:19,867
Now, you tell
your Prime Minister

39
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:22,301
that we have
a carrier group operating

40
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,368
less than 25 miles
off his shores.

41
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,067
It's armed.

42
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:31,067
President's gonna die.

43
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,633
There's nothing
you can do about it.

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,900
<i>LENNOX:
You've got to put a stop</i>
to this, Reed.</i>

45
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,334
Sir, there must have
a moment when you were

46
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,734
on board with
this plan.

47
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,334
Did you change your mind
along the way?

48
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,600
I need to know.

49
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,434
I was against you
from the start.

50
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,767
You're just as bad
as Fayed.

51
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,834
<i>MAN:
All right, here we go</i>

52
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,734
for a run-through,
everyone.

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,767
What is this?

54
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,167
Bomb!

55
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,834
LOWRY:
Citadel has been hit.
Send a medical team.

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,967
I repeat,
Citadel is down!

57
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,001
Send a medical team now!

58
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,167
I've got it.
Thank you.

59
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,234
Let me be clear about this
before we go anywhere.

60
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,600
You are a federal prisoner
under my custody.

61
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,500
You do not make a move
unless I tell you to,

62
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,867
you understand me?

63
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,301
You don't have
to threaten me, Jack.

64
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,867
I know what my role is.

65
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,301
I just want to be of service.

66
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,533
As far as I'm concerned,

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,867
you'll never do anything

68
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,700
that'll erase
what you've already done.

69
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,600
I understand your anger, I do.

70
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,067
But if you want
to find Gredenko,

71
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,867
we should leave now.

72
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,301
Get in the car.

73
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:11,067
(engine starts)

74
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:31,167
I haven't been outside
these gates in over a year.

75
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm sorry, Jack.

76
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,934
You don't need me
to tell you what it's like

77
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,700
to be locked up.
You're right, I don't.

78
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,633
But I know how it feels
to be locked away

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,767
from the rest of the world.

80
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,800
Lonely.

81
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,533
A silence.

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,567
Plays with your sanity.

83
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,734
But in that silence,
you can hear

84
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,001
the voice of your deepest self.

85
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,500
And if you listen
to that voice,

86
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,934
you have a chance
to heal.

87
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,001
(cell phone ringing)

88
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,301
This is Bauer.

89
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:13,401
Jack, it's Bill.

90
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:15,001
Are you on your way
to the Consulate?

91
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,334
Yes.

92
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,167
Before you get the,
you need to know something.

93
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,267
There was
an assassination attempt

94
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,434
on President Palmer.

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,867
He was wounded,
but we don't know

96
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,134
the extent of his injuries yet.

97
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,101
Oh, my God.

98
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,234
How did this happen?

99
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,967
Details are still coming in.

100
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:31,267
Secret Service
thinks it was Assad.

101
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,600
What?

102
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,267
They think he smuggled
some kind of explosive device

103
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,600
into the White House bunker.

104
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,967
Bill, that doesn't
make sense.

105
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:39,567
Assad was working with the
President to stop Fayed.

106
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,633
That's what he said
he was doing.
He wasn't lying.

107
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,334
He's dead, Jack.

108
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,967
Doesn't matter if
it was him or not.

109
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,101
He can't help
us stop Fayed.

110
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,067
Which means you're following
our only live lead.

111
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,633
I understand.

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,767
I'll get back to you as soon
as I'm at the Consulate.

113
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,767
All right.

114
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,934
What happened?

115
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:57,967
There was an
assassination attempt

116
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,500
on Wayne Palmer.

117
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,667
(steady beeping)

118
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,401
Excuse me,
Mr. Pollock.

119
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:34,401
(clears throat):
Yes. What do you want?

120
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,633
The Vice President
is being tele-briefed

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,633
in the conference room.

122
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,500
The SecDef wants
Mr. Lennox there.

123
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,667
Well, Mr. Lennox is occupied.

124
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,201
I'm covering
for him.

125
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,800
KANIN:
Dr. Welton is monitoring
the medical team,

126
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,434
so I've asked him
to brief us directly

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,134
on the President's condition.

128
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,134
Mr. Vice President.

129
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,867
Go ahead.

130
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,067
We're still trying to stabilize

131
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:56,101
President Palmer.

132
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,567
He was hit by shrapnel,

133
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,434
which entered
his upper chest and neck.

134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,667
He didn't suffer
any direct head wounds,

135
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,134
but he is unconscious.

136
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,201
Can you determine when he might
be able to resume

137
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,934
his presidential duties?

138
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,434
Sir, the President
was within ten feet

139
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,700
of a high-velocity
explosive device.

140
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,734
That he survived at all is...

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,767
a miracle.

142
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,101
KANIN:
Mr. Vice President,

143
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:21,234
as Secretary of Defense,
I'm the ranking member

144
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,667
of this committee.

145
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:26,201
And I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

146
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,834
we have no way
of knowing when

147
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,900
<i>or if</i> the President
will recover enough to function.

148
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:36,900
We need to proceed
under the assumption

149
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:41,101
that the President's duties
are now yours.

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,301
I'm going to be landing
in a few minutes.

151
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:57,600
As soon as I get there,

152
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,267
I want a full security briefing
from Tom Lennox.

153
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,567
Yes, sir.

154
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:03,767
We'll see you here soon.

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,734
Please submit your task profiles
to my office.

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,500
We'll reconvene when the
Vice President gets here.

157
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,134
Reed.

158
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,667
Where the hell is Tom Lennox?

159
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,667
I believe that he's conferencing
with the Attorney General.

160
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,101
I just spoke with the A.G.

161
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,468
He's had no contact with him.

162
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,734
Hmm.

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,301
Well, then I'm not sure.

164
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,767
You work for the man,
you don't know where he is?

165
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,334
President Palmer,
uh, was expecting him

166
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,600
in the broadcast studio,
and he didn't show up.

167
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,600
Tom Lennox is missing.

168
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,001
Have your team sweep the bunker.

169
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,001
Find him.

170
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,434
Yes, sir.

171
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,434
Need a ten-twenty

172
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,533
on Tom Lennox.

173
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,567
This is a priority
request from the SecDef.

174
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,934
You had the clarity
to understand

175
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,167
how to keep this
country safe.

176
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,667
But the President
was an obstacle.

177
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,700
We did what was
necessary.

178
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,234
Is he dead?

179
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,900
No.

180
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,401
But he's injured badly enough

181
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:25,167
that he won't
be able to serve.

182
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,167
Secret Service

183
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,434
is looking for Lennox.

184
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,734
They're sweeping the bunker.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,334
Let me handle him while
there's still time.

186
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:31,368
No.

187
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:32,700
Look, I told
you before,

188
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,067
I can make it
look like a suicide.

189
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:37,001
The situation
will support it.

190
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,900
He was depressed after the
President rejected his plan.

191
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,334
No. We cannot kill Tom Lennox.

192
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,800
Why not?

193
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,533
Because we're not murderers.

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,934
What we did was necessary for
the sake of national security.

195
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:53,101
Killing Lennox is just about us
trying to cover our involvement.

196
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,401
Getting caught--

197
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,667
never part of the plan.

198
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,167
Don't touch him.

199
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,533
Or what?

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,533
Or you'll have to kill me, too.

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Listen, I know
Tom Lennox.

202
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,034
He can be reasoned with.

203
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,600
So you really did it.

204
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,934
Only because it had to be done.

205
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,067
You were the one
who warned us all

206
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,934
that the logic
of this current engagement

207
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,800
would demand extreme action.

208
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,234
You said that for
the greater good,

209
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,201
individuals would
need to be sacrificed.

210
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,368
I wasn't referring
to the President

211
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,867
of the United
States.

212
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:52,468
Sir, the President's policies
would have aided the enemy.

213
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,667
They may have been
well-intentioned,

214
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,834
but they were naïve,
and they were dangerous,

215
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,401
and you know that.

216
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:03,067
Vice President Daniels
is running this country now.

217
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:06,567
He will implement
your security plan.

218
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:10,234
But if you implicate us,
it will only drag you into this.

219
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:12,201
And it will make
your security plan

220
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,600
that much harder
to push through.

221
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm the one who tried
to stop you, Reed.

222
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,101
They'll never believe you.

223
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,700
Sir, the only way

224
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,201
to stop these
nuclear weapons

225
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,667
from being detonated
on U.S. soil

226
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:29,334
is through the proposals
in your security plan.

227
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,867
And all I have to do
is do nothing.

228
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,301
Yes.

229
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:36,167
Carson has matched
the bomb signature

230
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,667
to a design

231
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,301
used by Assad's
organization.

232
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:43,201
The FBI will put this
all on Assad.

233
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:48,267
No one needs to
know the truth.

234
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,934
I'll know.

235
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:52,934
Sir, a guilty conscience
is a fair price to pay

236
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,267
for the survival
of this country.

237
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,734
(whispers):
They're coming.

238
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,267
Do you understand
the situation, sir?

239
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,368
I do understand, Reed.

240
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,034
I know that you will
do the right thing.

241
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,967
Good.

242
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,667
I'm gonna cut him loose.

243
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,368
(grunts)

244
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:34,134
Mr.Lennox,
are you all right?

245
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,368
Yes, Agent Lowry.

246
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,001
Sir, the secretary of defense

247
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,700
has been
looking for you.

248
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,633
Agent Lowry,
these men are responsible

249
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,533
for the attempted assassination
of the president.

250
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm surrendering myself

251
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,700
into custody till
I can talk to the
attorney general,

252
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,467
--WOMAN:
Welcome back, sir.

253
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,733
Thank you, Lisa.

254
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,401
I've sifted through
the latest flashes.

255
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,668
These are the ones

256
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,167
you need
to take a look at.

257
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:22,634
I went over
everything on
the plane.

258
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,733
I want to follow up
on the one from CTU.

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I'll get them
on the line.

260
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:32,067
I have the Vice President
calling for Mr. Buchanan.

261
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:35,833
(two beeps)

262
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,601
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan,
I have the Vice President

263
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,201
for you on line two.

264
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:40,534
This is Bill Buchanan.

265
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,067
LISA:
Sir, one moment

266
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,100
for the Vice
President.

267
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,334
Bill, I see
from the White House flashes

268
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,800
that President
Palmer granted
Charles Logan

269
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,167
some kind
of furlough.

270
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:55,534
I'm curious as to
what circumstances

271
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,000
could possibly
have led to that?

272
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,201
Logan claims he
can help us find
Dmitri Gredenko,

273
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,668
the man who supplied
the terrorists

274
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,034
with the suitcase
nukes, sir.

275
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,201
How?

276
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,167
Through the Russian Consul
in Los Angeles.

277
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,668
Logan believes this man
will know how to find Gredenko,

278
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,967
but he insisted on approaching
the consul in person.

279
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,234
I'm frankly surprised

280
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,000
President Palmer
trusted Charles Logan

281
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,067
to conduct any business
on the government's behalf.

282
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:17,601
I believe the president's
decision was informed

283
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:20,534
by the fact that we have no
other active leads on Gredenko.

284
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,100
Is Logan being supervised?

285
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,767
Yes, by one of our agents,

286
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,100
Jack Bauer.

287
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,201
Bauer's been instructed
to keep Logan on a short leash.

288
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,067
You keep me posted
to any progress.

289
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,634
And as soon as
this plays out,

290
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,267
I want him back
under house arrest.

291
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:34,467
Yes, sir.

292
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:39,733
You can come with me
into the consulate,

293
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,733
but I need to speak
to Markov alone.

294
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,401
You don't leave my sight.

295
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,100
Then this is a
waste of time.

296
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,467
Markov won't tell us
what we need to know
if you're in the room.

297
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:48,867
I don't let you out of my sight.

298
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,534
What do you think
I'm gonna do in there,

299
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,700
Jack, request asylum?

300
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,367
If it's
any comfort,

301
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:56,167
I don't think the
Russians would take me.

302
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,534
Fine.

303
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,534
You can talk to the consul

304
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,967
on your own, but I will be
right outside the door.

305
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,534
You try and move more
than 20 feet away from me,

306
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,867
and I will know.

307
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,568
I'm gonna prove

308
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,733
you wrong, Jack.

309
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,034
I'm only trying to help.

310
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,034
The Consul is expecting you,
Mr. President.

311
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,067
Follow me, please.

312
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:35,700
(knocking)

313
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,234
Mr. President.
Anatoly.

314
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,601
It's good
to see you.
It's a pleasure, sir.

315
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:41,767
How have you been?

316
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,367
Very well.

317
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,568
Still trying to do my best
for my country.

318
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,833
As much

319
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,700
as circumstances
will allow, of course.

320
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course.

321
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,867
My sincere sympathies
to your people

322
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,000
for the tragedy
this morning.

323
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:58,467
You have, uh,
condolences

324
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,934
and support
of my country.

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,534
Thank you.

326
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,234
Now...

327
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,267
how can I help you?

328
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,267
The bomb that exploded
this morning

329
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,201
was a Russian suitcase
nuclear device

330
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:17,967
supplied to the terrorists
by Dmitri Gredenko.

331
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,167
(heavy sigh)

332
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:27,568
No, thank you.
I don't smoke anymore.

333
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,100
(clipping with scissors)

334
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,367
(sighs)

335
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,934
Mr. President,

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,934
those weapons
were destroyed

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
as part of
our treaty.

338
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,700
We're certain
of our facts, Anatoly,

339
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,467
but I didn't come here
to make accusations.

340
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,767
I came here because we need
to know where Gredenko is.

341
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,767
(inhales deeply)

342
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,833
I will ask Moscow

343
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,568
to try to locate him
immediately.

344
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,067
I'm not asking Moscow,
I'm asking you.

345
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,167
I know that you
two close are close,

346
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,534
and you have been ever
since you fought together

347
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:09,434
in Afghanistan, so...

348
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,668
I ask again.

349
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,867
Where is he?

350
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,100
I don't know.

351
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:20,401
Dmitri and I were close
for many years,

352
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,833
but not now.

353
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,000
Forgive my lack of diplomacy,
but I don't believe you,

354
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,967
and I'm willing
to force the issue.

355
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,467
Moscow has always suspected
that someone inside

356
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,067
the Russian government
helped supply

357
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:36,334
the Sentox nerve gas

358
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,034
to the separatists
two years ago.

359
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,568
I have the tapes, Anatoly,

360
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,034
of every phone call
you made to my people.

361
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,800
I will send them
to President Suvarov.

362
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:54,568
You gave me your word that
my role would remain secret.

363
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,034
My promise is rendered

364
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
null and void by the fact

365
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,401
that the terrorists that
Gredenko was helping have

366
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,833
three more bombs.

367
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,000
I haven't spoken to Gredenko
for more than one year.

368
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,434
I will send the tapes,
you'll be recalled to Moscow,

369
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,601
and you will never
be heard of again.

370
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:15,301
You can send
all the tapes you like...

371
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,267
...destroy me many times over.

372
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,501
I do not know

373
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:22,568
where Gredenko is!

374
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:31,767
All right, Anatoly.

375
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,067
I believe you.

376
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:37,201
Please forgive
my tactics.

377
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,334
I'm trying
to save people's lives.

378
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:48,367
So... if you know anyone else

379
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,334
who might still be in contact
with Gredenko...

380
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,467
I will make calls.

381
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,401
But as far as I know,

382
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,733
everyone else has cut off
contact with Dmitri, as well.

383
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,367
Any support will be
greatly appreciated.

384
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,601
Of course.

385
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,867
Anatoly.

386
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,234
Mr. President.

387
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,668
(sighs)

388
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,534
He says he hasn't spoken
to Gredenko in a year.

389
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,800
He's lying.

390
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,800
They're still in contact,

391
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,668
and he knows enough about what's
going on to want to deny that.

392
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,434
How do you know?

393
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,367
Because I've done
enough lying myself

394
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,267
to be familiar
with the signs.

395
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,434
(phone ringing)

396
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,767
Yes?

397
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,301
MARKOV:
United States has connected you
with terrorists.

398
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,767
Are you sure?

399
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,134
They sent Charles Logan
to try and cause me

400
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,434
to give up your location.

401
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,867
The reason

402
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:14,467
we brought the Arabs into this
was to conceal our involvement.

403
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,000
Now we're exposed.

404
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,634
Russia is exposed.

405
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,201
The Americans are speculating.

406
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,568
They have no evidence.

407
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,668
If they did,
they wouldn't have sent Logan.

408
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,668
(sighs):
I don't know.

409
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,700
Don't worry, Dmitri.

410
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,700
By the time
they find anything,

411
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,234
it will be
too late.

412
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:33,067
All right.

413
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:35,534
Let me know
if you hear anything more.

414
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,501
Drive through
the front gates.

415
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,900
Pull over as soon as you're out
of sight of the guards.

416
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,201
What are you going to do?

417
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,601
(phone ringing)

418
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:54,401
O'Brian.

419
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,601
Chloe, it's Jack.

420
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:58,201
I need you to gain access
to the DWP server.

421
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,234
I want you to
disable the
power going

422
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,833
to the Russian
Consulate as soon
as you can. Chloe,

423
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,334
you need to do this
under the radar.

424
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,167
How long do you need
the power out for?

425
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,301
60 seconds. Make it look
like a grid failure

426
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,501
in case the consulate tries
to contact the DWP.

427
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:13,568
I'll get back to you
when I'm ready.

428
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,501
Are you going
back in there?

429
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:22,034
Jack, you just spent nearly
two years in a Chinese prison

430
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,201
because you violated the
sovereignty of their consulate.

431
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,934
Now you plan to go back
into the Russian consulate

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,700
and take a chance
on that happening again?!

433
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,868
--REPORTER:
As nightfall approaches
in the Pacific time zone,

434
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:47,234
Hazmat teams and emergency crews
in Valencia, California,

435
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,401
continue to search
for survivors,

436
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:53,967
while the official death toll
stands at just over 12,000.

437
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,100
(phone rings)

438
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,267
And the number is rising...

439
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,434
Hi.

440
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,267
Where are you?

441
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,033
I'm still at the airport.

442
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,234
Waiting for my plane. Why?

443
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
What's up?

444
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,367
About a half hour ago

445
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,467
there was an attempt made

446
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:06,100
on President
Palmer's life.
What?

447
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,567
They won't know the full
extent of his injuries

448
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,300
until he regains
consciousness.

449
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,967
There's been nothing

450
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,000
of this on the news.

451
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,134
Hasn't been made public yet.

452
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,267
The Vice President's
on his way

453
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,401
back to the White House.

454
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,167
He's already assumed
executive duties.

455
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,634
I have to go back.

456
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,501
You think Daniels
will have you back?

457
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,768
You've already tendered
your resignation.

458
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,334
Nothing's been processed.

459
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,000
Technically, I can withdraw

460
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,267
my resignation.

461
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,601
I've gotta go back, Bill.

462
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,334
Look, I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

463
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,634
All right.

464
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:42,834
Once we're settled in,

465
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,467
I want to go over
an annotated copy

466
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:45,667
of the Lennox proposal.

467
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,567
I'll need you to work up
a distribution list.

468
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,200
The President rejected
that plan.

469
00:21:57,334 --> 00:22:00,033
What's your point?

470
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,701
Don't you think it might be a
little too soon to enact it?

471
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:05,100
(sighs)

472
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:08,900
Lisa, a Muslim terrorist
just set off a bomb

473
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,033
inside the White House.

474
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,868
If anything, we've delayed this
far too long.

475
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,067
Mr. Vice President.

476
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,234
Hello, Ethan.

477
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,634
What's the President's
condition?

478
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,634
Well, they've managed
to stabilize him.

479
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:31,033
But it's still too soon
to make a prognosis.

480
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,134
Something else has come up.

481
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,933
There's been a development
in the investigation

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,100
of the assassination
attempt.

483
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:48,967
Tom Lennox has remanded
himself into custody.

484
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,267
Lennox?

485
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:54,834
What are you talking about?

486
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,567
Oh, just about two hours ago.

487
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:59,033
That's when Reed
first hinted

488
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,667
that there was a plot
against the President.

489
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,701
But you waited an hour before
you tried to report it.

490
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,334
Because there was nothing

491
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:08,033
actionable that...
just all innuendo.

492
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,167
I was simply trying to
wait and find out more.

493
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,401
By the time I realized they
were making their move,

494
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:15,501
Reed caught me trying
to alert Agent Hollister.

495
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,601
That's when he struck you
over the head and tied you up.

496
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,900
That's correct.

497
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,900
So when you provided
Bruce Carson's clearance

498
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,434
into the White House...
Wait, no, no.

499
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,434
No, I didn't provide
anybody clearance.

500
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,701
Reed stole my
clearance card.

501
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:28,401
And gave these men the
President's classified

502
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,768
itinerary,
you were just pretending.

503
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,434
Yes.

504
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:37,701
Or maybe it's just that you
had second thoughts?

505
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:39,434
(sighs)
(door opens)

506
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:47,434
I would like to speak to
Mr. Lennox alone, please.

507
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,467
Yes, sir.

508
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,834
I tried to stop this, Noah.

509
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,467
I'd like to believe you, Tom.

510
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,634
But I'll leave it

511
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,868
to the Justice Department to
determine your role in this.

512
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,100
As well as Assad's.

513
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,167
Assad?

514
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,334
They were setting him up.

515
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,768
He had nothing to do with this.

516
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,567
You don't know that.

517
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,634
It's my understanding,

518
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:22,567
you suggested that others
besides Reed and this man

519
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:24,000
Carson may have been involved.

520
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,134
Only because Reed
implied as much.

521
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,768
I was just trying to ferret out
who else might be involved.

522
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,900
And did you?

523
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,801
No.

524
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:33,267
Then it is conceivable

525
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:36,300
that Assad may have been,
at the very least,

526
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,801
a willing participant
in this attack.

527
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:40,801
That makes no sense whatsoever.

528
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,601
Assad was a terrorist

529
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,801
who hated this country

530
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,267
and everything
it stands for.

531
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,367
What better way for him
to rally his people

532
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:48,868
than to martyr himself

533
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,501
by murdering the President
of the United States.

534
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:51,967
Don't you understand
that is exactly

535
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:55,467
what Reed and Carson wanted this
to look like and now

536
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:56,634
you're playing right into it.

537
00:24:56,701 --> 00:25:00,234
I am going to address
the nation shortly,

538
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,734
to inform the public
about what's happened.

539
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,967
Until I have
all the facts,

540
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,134
I am not about to tell them

541
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,467
that Hamri Al-Assad is innocent
in this.

542
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,401
I see what you're doing
here, Noah.

543
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,501
By scapegoating Assad,

544
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,167
you'll be able to reverse
the President's agenda.

545
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:26,200
Get even more aggressive
with the Islamic community.

546
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,868
You think I don't see
what you're doing here?

547
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,300
It's your plan, Tom.

548
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,868
You outlined those
measures yourself.

549
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,601
I was your staunchest advocate.

550
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:41,234
What has happened
to the President

551
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,267
is horrific.

552
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,701
But if there is any good
to come from this,

553
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:50,401
it's that we now have
the opportunity

554
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,868
to do what we both know is

555
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,501
in the best interests of
protecting this country.

556
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:57,000
You're asking a whole heck
of a lot more

557
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,501
than for me just to maintain
silence on Assad.

558
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:03,601
The Cabinet knows that you are
the architect of the plan.

559
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,467
If you're not on
the face of it now,

560
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,234
it may raise questions.

561
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,367
Or have you come to believe
the President was correct

562
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,534
in rejecting your proposals?

563
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:12,100
No.

564
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,434
I-I know it's, it's the only way
to stop these attacks.

565
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,234
Then you can stick
to your assertion

566
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,267
of Assad's complete innocence.

567
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,467
Or I can clear you
of these charges

568
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,933
and you can help me
to initiate your plan,

569
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,801
which we both know is

570
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:30,434
in the best interest
of the country.

571
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,167
Agent Lowry.

572
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,967
I don't want Mr. Lennox's
statement promoted

573
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,401
to the Attorney General until
it's gone through my office.

574
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,567
Yes, sir.

575
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:30,134
* *

576
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,534
(speaking Russian)

577
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,567
(buzzing)

578
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,801
Have you got it?

579
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,534
Yeah, I've logged
onto the DWP Server.

580
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:55,834
You have a 60 second window

581
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,567
before the building's circuits
kick back in.

582
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:01,000
Hold on.

583
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,200
Shut it down now.

584
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:16,634
(beeping)

585
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:17,667
What is happening?

586
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:18,734
I don't know.

587
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,300
Something's wrong.

588
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,401
You check the upper level,
I check the lower level.

589
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,667
Got it.

590
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,267
(speaking Russian)

591
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,834
What is this?

592
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,267
Put your hands
where I can see them.

593
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,768
I don't know what he's doing,
sending you here.

594
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,768
Where's Gredenko?

595
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,033
I told him
I don't know.

596
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,401
We know you're lying.

597
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,234
Get you hands away
from the desk now!

598
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,701
Sit down!

599
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,534
You're breaking
international law.

600
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,501
Violating sovereignty

601
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:48,667
of the Consulate.

602
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,667
I don't have time
to ask nicely.

603
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:52,033
Where's Gredenko?

604
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,933
I-I don't know, I swear.

605
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,367
(speaking Russian)

606
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:59,467
I'm not sure
what's happening.

607
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:00,933
When the power
came back on,

608
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
the Consul's panic button
was triggered.

609
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,801
(knocking on door)

610
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,734
Consul Markov?

611
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:09,900
Are you all right?

612
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,234
I've taken the
Consul hostage

613
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
at gunpoint.

614
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,367
If you make any attempt

615
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,000
to enter this room,
I will kill him.

616
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,134
Do you understand me?

617
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,367
Find out who this man is
and alert Moscow.

618
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:20,868
(speaking Russian)

619
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,634
This is Jack,
let me speak to Buchanan.

620
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:34,567
MAN:
Jack Bauer on line one.

621
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,300
What's going on, Jack?

622
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:37,601
Bill, I got a situation.

623
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,134
Logan's play didn't work.

624
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,567
So I came back
to the Consulate

625
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:41,768
to talk to Markov myself.

626
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,401
Before I could get any
information from him,

627
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,134
I was discovered.

628
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,367
I've barricaded myself
in his office,

629
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,434
but I don't know how much
more time I've got.

630
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,634
It's Russian territory I can't
sanction what you're doing.

631
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:51,900
I know, Bill.

632
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,300
I'm calling because you need
to call the White House

633
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,334
and advise them.

634
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,401
I want you

635
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,768
to stand down,
find a way out.

636
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,267
I'm not going anywhere
until Markov tells me

637
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,667
how to find Gredenko.

638
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:43,067
--Mr. Vice President.

639
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,467
The Press Secretary

640
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,067
is set up
for your televised address.

641
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,067
You'll be going live

642
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,234
in approximately
ten minutes.

643
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,000
(clearing throat):
Thank you, Lisa.

644
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,467
Have you finished drafting
my statement?

645
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:55,901
I'll have it for
you momentarily.

646
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,367
I thought you should know I
just received word Karen Hayes

647
00:30:58,434 --> 00:30:59,934
has withdrawn
her resignation.

648
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,267
She's on her
way here now.

649
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:03,901
Do we know what prompted
her resignation

650
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,467
in the first place?

651
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,467
Officially, it was to
return to Los Angeles

652
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,400
to be with her husband,

653
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,067
but rumor has it
she stepped down

654
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,167
because of her opposition
to the Lennox Plan.

655
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,534
I see.

656
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,968
CTU OPERATOR:
Mr. Vice President,

657
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,400
I have Bill Buchanan
on the line.

658
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,267
This is the Vice President.

659
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:24,434
Sir, a situation has developed
at the Russian Consulate.

660
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,601
What kind of situation?

661
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,467
Jack Bauer has taken
Russian Consul Markov hostage.

662
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,100
He's holding him at gunpoint
inside the Consulate.

663
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,067
What?

664
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,167
How could that happen?

665
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:36,834
Markov denied having
any contact with Gredenko,

666
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:39,400
but Logan insisted
he was lying.

667
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,834
When the escort left
the Consulate,

668
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,334
Bauer went back
to question Markov.

669
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,667
That's when
he was discovered.

670
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:46,667
My God.

671
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:50,467
Did you approve

672
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,200
these actions?
No, sir.

673
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:54,067
Bauer acted
on his own authority.

674
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,968
And the questionable assumption
of Charles Logan.

675
00:31:57,033 --> 00:32:00,634
Sir, Bauer has absolutely no
reason to trust Charles Logan.

676
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,033
(phone ringing)

677
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,501
Yet he was convinced enough
to take the action that he did.

678
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,634
In any event, he's created
a diplomatic mess.

679
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,234
If Markov has information that
could lead us to Gredenko...
Yes.

680
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,000
...then extracting
it is our only chance

681
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,968
to stop the next nuke
from being detonated.

682
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,000
Excuse me, sir.

683
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,734
Not now, Lisa.
Sir, it's President Suvarov.

684
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,968
(sighs)

685
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,167
(clears throat)

686
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,667
Bill, I don't know how long
I can hold off the Russians.

687
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,133
If Markov is connected
to these nukes,

688
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
Bauer had better get
it out of him fast.

689
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,033
Yes, sir.

690
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,968
(sighs)

691
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,667
Mr. President,

692
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,834
this is Vice President Daniels.

693
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:49,234
I was expecting to speak
to President Palmer.

694
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,234
My apologies.

695
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,534
I'm afraid he's
unavailable.

696
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,701
Unavailable?

697
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:56,434
Sir, I'm speaking
on his authority.

698
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:57,501
I assume that you're calling

699
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,067
about the incident
at your Consulate.

700
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,234
Let me assure you
this man is acting

701
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,634
on his own and not
under the orders or authority

702
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,167
of the United States government.

703
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,701
Nevertheless, this is a gross
violation of our sovereignty.

704
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:12,467
If your agent
does not stand down immediately,

705
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,868
my country will have no choice
but to retaliate

706
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:17,868
with the most forceful
diplomatic measures

707
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:19,334
at our disposal.

708
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,367
I understand your position,
Mr. President,

709
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,534
but before you escalate this,
you should understand mine.

710
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:27,601
We have learned that
Consul Markov is most likely

711
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,968
in contact with Dmitri Gredenko,
who we've linked

712
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:33,501
to the nuclear attack that took
place on U.S. soil this morning.

713
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:37,234
If that's true, we will look
upon him as a coconspirator

714
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,634
in the attack.

715
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:44,133
Mr. Vice President,
I deeply regret the tragedy

716
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,901
that your country
has experienced today,

717
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,901
but you must make these charges

718
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,367
through proper
diplomatic channels

719
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:52,567
after your agent
has surrendered.

720
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,667
(grunts)

721
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:58,934
I want to know where Gredenko
is and what he's doing.

722
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,968
(whispering):
I don't know.

723
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,767
I haven't spoken to Gredenko

724
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,133
since he arrived
in the United States.

725
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,400
I never said he was
in the United States.

726
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:20,100
Why don't I tell you
what we know?

727
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,133
We already know
that Gredenko supplied Fayed

728
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,601
with the five suitcase nukes.

729
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,767
What doesn't make sense is
why he's still involved

730
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:27,868
unless, of course,
he's doing

731
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:30,601
something else for Fayed.

732
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,467
That's what we want
to know.

733
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,868
What is Gredenko doing
for Fayed?!

734
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,601
(whispering):
I don't know.

735
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,767
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know

736
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,200
or you're gonna start losing
your fingers

737
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:44,701
one by one.

738
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:45,767
This is
your last chance.

739
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:52,934
No!

740
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,901
(screams)

741
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,067
I've got the feed.

742
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,200
Don't move in yet.

743
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:08,968
He's too close to Markov.

744
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:11,367
You have one of
two choices.

745
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,634
You can either give me
the information that I want

746
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,000
and I'll go pick up Gredenko,

747
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,067
or I can kill you.

748
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,567
And I'll make sure
Gredenko finds out.

749
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,534
And he'll panic
because he'll think

750
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,033
you gave him up before you died.

751
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,901
He'll be forced
to use his exit route.

752
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,367
Either way he stops what he's
doing in this country now!

753
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,734
The choice is yours.

754
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,501
How do I find
Gredenko?!

755
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,467
(breathing heavily)

756
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,367
M-Mojave Desert.

757
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,667
Shadow Valley.

758
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:43,701
Where in the
Shadow Valley?

759
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,400
I don't know.

760
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,267
What is
he doing?

761
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,534
What is he doing?!

762
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:51,901
Launching drones.

763
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:55,734
What?

764
00:35:55,801 --> 00:36:00,501
Aerial drones for Fayed.

765
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,801
His delivery system
for nuclear bombs.

766
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:06,000
How soon will
the drones be ready?

767
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,534
Two hours.

768
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:12,434
In two hours, all the bombs
will be in the air.

769
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:14,434
You son of a bitch.

770
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,200
(screams)

771
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,567
(breathing heavily)

772
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,567
(laughs)

773
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,033
Now!

774
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,634
(yells)

775
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:35,667
Don't let anyone near this man.

776
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,934
Do you understand?

777
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,034
--My fellow Americans...

778
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,467
I regret to inform you that,
a short time ago,

779
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:56,367
President Palmer was
seriously injured

780
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:58,800
in an assassination
attempt at the White House.

781
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,967
Thankfully,
he is alive

782
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:04,700
and currently in
stable condition.

783
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,700
The prime suspect,
Hamri Al-Assad,

784
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,267
was killed in the explosion.

785
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,733
And in light of this heinous

786
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,234
and cowardly act, compounded
by the tragedy in California,

787
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:16,401
I will be pushing forward

788
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,267
an aggressive agenda
of national security,

789
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:23,100
one that will, out of necessity,

790
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:26,034
suspend certain civil liberties.

791
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:30,467
This is the price of war.

792
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:33,201
Make no mistake.

793
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,967
That is exactly what this is.

794
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,568
Have you been able
to reach Jack?
No,

795
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,767
but my system logs confirm

796
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,568
he did try to call in.

797
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,934
Are we monitoring
communications

798
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,967
in and out
of the Russian Consulate?
We are,

799
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,733
but diplomatic
traffic is encrypted

800
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,668
with an advanced algorithm
that we've never been able

801
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,167
to crack, but...

802
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,434
I think I have a way
around that.

803
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,401
One of the computers
in the Consulate isn't

804
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,733
properly shielded,
so I'm picking up

805
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,034
a digital shadow
of their messages

806
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,034
before they're encrypted.

807
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,800
Look.
What's that?

808
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:58,800
ASCII code.

809
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,467
It is?
Yeah, in Russian.

810
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:01,934
I just have to load
a Cyrillic grid

811
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,467
and I should be
good to go.

812
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,034
(speaking Russian)

813
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,668
Oh, no.

814
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:12,833
They're saying they've got
an American agent in custody.

815
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,700
Forceful and decisive action
needs to be taken.

816
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,267
(phone rings)

817
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,833
And I promise you...

818
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,000
Buchanan.

819
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,800
Sir, Morris just intercepted
some bandwidth

820
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,301
from the Russian Consulate.

821
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:27,367
Apparently, they
got to Jack.

822
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,134
What do you mean
"got to him"?

823
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,700
They moved in on his position
and recovered Markov.

824
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,201
Sir, they're holding Jack
prisoner.

825
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,301
Sir, we probably should inform

826
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,900
the Vice President.
No, no, not yet.

827
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:47,301
He's in a diplomatic standoff
with Suvarov.

828
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,201
He won't get anywhere
with a direct appeal.

829
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:51,334
So what's our next move?

830
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:57,000
Have Special Ops draw up a plan
to get into the Consulate.

831
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,668
I want to give
the Vice President the option

832
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,267
to take the Consul by force...

833
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,733
...and hopefully rescue Jack.

834
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,401
(Jack wheezing,
men speaking Russian)

835
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,568
(coughing)

836
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:22,034
(speaking Russian)

837
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,733
Enough.

838
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,367
Please, you have
to listen to me.
I am not
allowed to talk to you.

839
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:27,568
That's because your
Consul doesn't want you

840
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:29,934
to hear what I know.

841
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,201
Dmitri Gredenko is
responsible

842
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:33,100
for supplying the terrorists
with the nuclear bomb

843
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,334
that was detonated
earlier today.

844
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:36,733
Markov is working with him

845
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,967
against the orders
of your government.

846
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,267
(coughs)

847
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,568
You will get the chance
to make these allegations

848
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:42,668
through
the appropriate channels.

849
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,000
No, there's not enough time.

850
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,767
Gredenko has
three more bombs.

851
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,000
They're going
to find their targets

852
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,367
by way of an unmanned
drone aircraft.

853
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:51,367
With the Consul's
knowledge?

854
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:52,401
That is a ridiculous
accusation.

855
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,434
He is the one who told me;
he confessed.

856
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:55,934
Under duress!

857
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,668
He gave me
Gredenko's location.

858
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:59,334
He told me the aircraft
would be ready

859
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,434
to launch
within two hours.

860
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,334
I know you believe me!

861
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,467
You know
about Markov's connection

862
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,733
to Gredenko.

863
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,401
Please.

864
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,900
You have to help.

865
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:13,733
Even if you are telling me
the truth,

866
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,967
there is nothing
I can do.

867
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,100
The Consul approves
all communications

868
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,234
to Moscow.

869
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:18,867
I don't want you
to call Moscow.

870
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,100
I want you to call CTU.

871
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,501
I want you to give them
Gredenko's location

872
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:24,000
and advise them
of the time frame.

873
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:27,900
Where is he?

874
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,733
Somewhere in the high desert.

875
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,767
The Shadow Valley.

876
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:35,934
You need to call
310-597-3781.

877
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,934
You need to tell them
you have a message

878
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,401
for Bill Buchanan
from me.

879
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,034
My name is Jack Bauer.

880
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,034
(breathing heavily)

881
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,967
Please... please.

882
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,601
I hope you are telling me
the truth.

883
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:51,833
For your sake
as well as mine.

884
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,034
You know I am.

885
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,301
Otherwise, you wouldn't
even consider doing this.

886
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,134
You need to hurry.

887
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,434
OPERATOR:
CTU.

888
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,568
I need to speak
to Bill Buchanan.

889
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,034
I'm sorry,
Mr. Buchanan's in a meeting.

890
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,234
It's urgent!

891
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:55,201
Mr. Buchanan,
there's a man on the line

892
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,334
from the Russian Consulate.

893
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:58,301
He says it's urgent.

894
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:00,100
This is Bill Buchanan.

895
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,534
Hello?

896

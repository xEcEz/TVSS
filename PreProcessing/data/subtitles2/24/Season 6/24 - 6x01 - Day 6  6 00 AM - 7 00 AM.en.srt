00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,475
<i>America has been victimized again.</i>

3
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,918
<i>Last night terrorist's attack
in San Antonio</i>

4
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,072
<i>was not the latest
in the series of bombings</i>

5
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,700
<i>that began eleven weeks ago
in ten differents cities.</i>

6
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,492
<i>Over nine hundred people
have been killed this far</i>

7
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,646
<i>and while no one
is claiming responsability</i>

8
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,018
<i>for this wave of death,</i>

9
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,243
<i>evidence points to Islamic militance.</i>

10
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:39,059
<i>Here in Los Angeles,
the mood can only be described</i>

11
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:40,506
<i>as tense and fearfull</i>

12
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,457
<i>as the department of Homeland Security
is urging all citizens</i>

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,232
<i>to report without delay
any suspicious persons or activities.</i>

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,240
<i>We spoke with the department
spokesperson who says, quote:<i>

15
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:52,056
<i>"We don't want to start a witchhunt</i>

16
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:54,161
<i>"but we would rather here*
on the side of caution</i>

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,891
<i>"than become the next target."</i>

18
00:00:55,987 --> 00:00:58,538
<i>"And he says
"the vigilance of the public</i>

19
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:00,900
<i>"is our best line of defense
against attacks."</i>

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,463
Stop, stop, stop!

21
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,817
Open the doors!

22
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,425
Please, I have to get to work.

23
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,512
I'll be late for work.

24
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:14,773
Please, open the door!

25
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,716
Come on, man.

26
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,049
Open the door.

27
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:21,078
Open the d... I...

28
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:22,238
can't believe you...

29
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,518
I can't believe
you didn't open the door!

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,677
I have as much right
to be on the bus as you!

31
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,016
Our country is under <i>siege</i>!

32
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,741
You're the national security advisor,
Karen!

33
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,915
Frankly,
I'm surprised by your resistance.

34
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:15,480
These places
that you keep building?

35
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,203
They're nothing more
than concentration camps.

36
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,019
Detention facilities.

37
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:23,275
And the criteria for determining
who should be detained

38
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,588
are very reasonable.

39
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,748
Reasonable?

40
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,409
This revised plan of yours

41
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,539
justifies locking-up every American
who prays towards Mecca.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,761
That's ridiculous exageration,
you know it.

43
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,674
Right now,
the American Muslim community

44
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,940
is our greatest asset.

45
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,384
They have provided
law enforcement with hundreds of tips,

46
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,113
and none a single member
of that community

47
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,843
has been implicated in these attacks.

48
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,060
So far!

49
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,287
Mr. President,
the people are loosing faith

50
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:48,258
in our hability to protect them.

51
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:51,090
We've got to do something
about this, now.

52
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,925
And locking-up more Muslims

53
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,286
will not make them safer.

54
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,465
No, Karen,

55
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,213
but it will make them feel safer.

56
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,208
What about the cost of the civil
unrest that your plan will create?

57
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,653
- They will be riots, demonstrations--
- Security has--

58
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,141
its price!

59
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,846
So does freedom, Tom.

60
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:11,445
Listen, I just don't see how
I can sign off on something like this.

61
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,932
I mean, it wasn't just three months ago
that I took an oath

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,428
to preserve, protect
and defend the constitution.

63
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:19,724
And what about preserving, protecting
and defending the American people?

64
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,729
All of these measures are legal.

65
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:26,233
Blake has been all over these thing
with the attorney general.

66
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,891
There is a precedent, sir.

67
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:28,990
Especially in war time.

68
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,598
Lincoln suspended the Habeus Corpus.
Roosevelt sent executive...

69
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,165
Yes Blake, I know this!

70
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:36,659
And Roosevelt imprisonned
over 200.000 Japanese-Americans,

71
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:39,936
what most historians consider
to be a shameful mistake.

72
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:43,661
Well, I would ask those historians
how many of those Japanese-Americans

73
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:48,220
were thus prevented from perpretrating
acts of sabotage in this country?

74
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:51,751
I realize that what I'm proposing
has its challenges

75
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:55,849
but we cannot continue
to keep our heads burried in the sand.

76
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,345
- Mr President?
- Yeah?

77
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:01,859
Another attack?

78
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,592
Los Angeles. A bus.

79
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,664
How many casualties?

80
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,688
Twenty three so far,
including the suicide bomber.

81
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,901
We're almost certain this man Assad
is behind all these attacks, right?

82
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,425
Yes, sir. We confirmed
he arrived in the United-States

83
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,921
three days before
the first bombing in San Antonio.

84
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,438
And let us not forget

85
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:33,866
Assad has been calling
for the destruction of the United-States

86
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,053
for the last twenty years.

87
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,180
Mr President, my analysts believe
that Assad's organization

88
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,471
cannot survive without him

89
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,042
and once he's dead,
these attacks will stop.

90
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:46,727
So, this assumes the success
of the operation to terminate Assad.

91
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,504
CTU estimates
successful probability at 75%.

92
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,209
Oh, I think that's very generous.

93
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:55,138
You know... It sounds to me like
you're anticipating failure, Tom.

94
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,088
I fully acknowledge, sir,

95
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,141
that this is our only option.

96
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:02,730
But I'm fervently
advocating contingencies.

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,152
Contingencies are willing good, Tom.
But CTU needs to eliminate Assad.

98
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:11,933
That's all there is to it.

99
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:17,154
God knows were paying
a steep enough price to get him.

100
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,505
I've told you twenty times.

101
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:22,949
You don't send that report
without a certified header on it.

102
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,283
This makes twenty-one,
you should update your count.

103
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,119
Do you... and I'm just curious,

104
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,124
ever open your mouth
without sarcasm just spilling out of it?

105
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,443
Sorry, are we done here?

106
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,581
Look, I'm just telling you to be careful

107
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,677
otherwise you will find yourself back
selling lady shoes in Beverly Hills.

108
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,455
You're settling well into the whole
management thing, aren't you?

109
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:40,784
What's your problem with me?

110
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,624
I like you fine as an analyst.
Actually, you were very good.

111
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:44,800
As a boss?

112
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:45,943
Bit of a bull.

113
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,378
What's going on?

114
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,771
I talked to your boyfriend.

115
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,174
He's on self distraught.

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,693
You promised me
to get along with Milo.

117
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:03,065
I'm sorry darling.
That's a promise I just can't keep.

118
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,398
Morris.

119
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:08,905
Morris!

120
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,891
I had the same problem with
the department head when I first started

121
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,707
and I learned how to fit in.
There's no reason why you can't.

122
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,910
Except I don't happen to be
a pretty lady.

123
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,388
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:21,724
- You're a hotty.
- No, I'm not.

125
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,975
Yes you are. Deal with it.

126
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,539
- Morris, we're at work.
- So?

127
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,215
It's unprofessional.

128
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:28,911
You say you don't like it?

129
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:31,360
No, I'm not saying that.
I just came go see

130
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,412
if you got a request for Homeland
on the priority channel.

131
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:35,513
No.

132
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:38,151
Why did they send it only to me?

133
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:40,392
I don't know.

134
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:42,983
Just try to get along.

135
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,979
'Cause you asked... I will.

136
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:52,129
Nadia. I just got a weird request
from Homeland Security.

137
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:55,103
They want to set up a channel
and I want to clear with you first.

138
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,339
Set yourself clear.

139
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:59,131
They want it formatted
according to military specs.

140
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,243
Coordinating assault with the cover-
attack helicopters from Camp Pendleton.

141
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:03,888
- When?
- Thirty minutes.

142
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,236
An assault on who?

143
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,135
Assad.

144
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:11,206
What are you talking about?
We don't even know where Assad is.

145
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:12,590
We will. We have a lead.

146
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,823
No, we don't.
If we did, I would know about it.

147
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:17,508
We found a way to get Assad's location.

148
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:18,581
How?

149
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:23,355
Jack Bauer.

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,814
Jack's in a Chinese prison.

151
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,299
Not anymore. The President
negociates his release two days ago.

152
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:32,510
Jack's coming back?

153
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,988
Yes.

154
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,493
Why did the Chinese let him go?
Why today?

155
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:39,207
Does Assad have to do with the attacks?

156
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,097
How do we think
Jack's gonna lead us to Assad?

157
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,635
Chloe, I can't talk about this...

158
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,463
- Not yet.
- Why not?

159
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:47,787
Can Bill Buchanan talk about it?

160
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,218
He's meeting Jack
at Point Mugu Naval Air Station.

161
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,492
Now, open that military channel.
Put it through the conference area.

162
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,837
The President wasn't giving up
a lot to make this happen.

163
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:16,263
I wish he were coming back
under different circumstances.

164
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,735
We don't know
what his state of mind will be.

165
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,221
If he doesn't cooperate,
we need to be prepared.

166
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:01,749
Mr Buchanan.

167
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:04,634
I need your signature
on this release document.

168
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,044
Take those cuffs off him.

169
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,450
Jack.

170
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,640
It's okay.

171
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:25,717
Come with me.

172
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,976
Please convey to your President

173
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:45,664
that Mister Bauer
never broke his silence.

174
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,722
He hasn't spoken a word
in nearly two years.

175
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,383
The President has paid a high price
for Mr. Bauer's freedom.

176
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,747
What he wants from him
must be very important.

177
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,282
President Palmer
wants to speak to you himself

178
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:16,551
as soon as we debriefe.

179
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,885
I'm sorry, Jack. How could you know...

180
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:24,711
Wayne Palmer is president.

181
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,591
He's the one who negociated
your release.

182
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,710
I can't even begin to imagine
what you went through, threre, Jack.

183
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,549
There's a reason you're here now.

184
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,056
The last eleven weeks,

185
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,982
our cities have been targeted by...

186
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,515
... a series of terror attacks.

187
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,668
Buses, trains... shopping malls...

188
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,068
The last one was fifteen minutes ago,
here in Los Angeles.

189
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,571
Hamir Al-Assad.

190
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:57,128
Assad's here, Jack.

191
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,234
Four days ago,

192
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,567
one of Assad's men contacted us.

193
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:06,268
He said he'd give up Assad
for 25 million dollars.

194
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,758
But he's demanding
something more than money.

195
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,205
He wants you, Jack.

196
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,366
He wants you dead.

197
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,230
It's Abou Fayed.

198
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:30,605
He wants his pound of flesh
for what happened in Beyrouth.

199
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:33,259
We offered him...

200
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,841
other alternatives, we did everything
we could think of, Jack.

201
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,062
But he will only agree to give us Assad

202
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:41,088
in exchange for you.

203
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,152
He's demanded
our surveillance protocols.

204
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,443
Which means we can't risk an extraction.

205
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,701
Once he has you...

206
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,026
... you'll be on your own.

207
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,742
You understand what this means, Jack?

208
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,054
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself

209
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,653
so we can eliminate Assad.

210
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:07,965
I can't hear you, Jack.

211
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,212
Audrey?

212
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,441
Audrey doesn't know you're back.

213
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,348
My daughter?

214
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,614
Kim doesn't know either.

215
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,208
You'll keep it that way?

216
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,276
I know what's being asked of me, Curtis.

217
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,000
You don't need your firearm.

218
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,450
Before we do this,

219
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,833
I would like to clean up.

220
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,998
We've got an area set up for you,

221
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,737
and we brought you some new clothes.

222
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,556
Bill?

223
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:42,918
<i>We have Jack.</i>

224
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:44,619
Good.

225
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,373
I thought I was prepared, but he's...

226
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,288
... worse than I expected. Much worse.

227
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,543
I know how hard this must be for you,

228
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,075
but everything depends
on this operation.

229
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,570
I understand.

230
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,795
I know you do.

231
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,086
I wish I were there with you.

232
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,061
You're where you need to be.

233
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:13,051
I miss you.

234
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,240
I miss you too.

235
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:18,892
<i>About to take Jack
to the drop point, now.</i>

236
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:20,487
<i>Bye.</i>

237
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,836
<i>Los Angeles has now been added</i>

238
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,860
<i>to the list of major cities
hit by terrorist attacks.</i>

239
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,898
<i>The department of Homeland Security
has raised the threat level</i>

240
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,175
<i>to red, the highest level
since the department was formed.</i>

241
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,389
FBI will handle all the field surges
outside the city,

242
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,109
so, just focus on the main grid.

243
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,434
Nadia, I need to talk to you.

244
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,515
Resetup and check back with me.

245
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:45,568
Did you open that military channel,
put it through to the conference area?

246
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:48,601
I've tried to locate Bill or Curtis
to find out what's going on with Jack.

247
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,784
But they're both offline,
their status is blocked.

248
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,914
I told you, Chloe,
I can't talk about this.

249
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,062
Nadia, you've only been here
a couple of months

250
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,382
and you don't know me very well,

251
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,269
but if you did, you would know how much
Jack Bauer means to me.

252
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:02,183
You would also know that
sooner or later, I will find out.

253
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,983
So why don't you just tell me right now?

254
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:05,333
I don't have the authorisation.

255
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:06,720
Why don't I just call Division,

256
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:10,770
and let them know about the time that
you left the Jarvis firewall unsecured?

257
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:14,117
If it weren't for me,
you would have been fired out of that.

258
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,784
We were contacted 4 days ago
by a man named Fayed.

259
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,038
He offered to give us Assad's location
for a list of demands

260
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,546
and one of them was Jack Bauer.

261
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,831
Jack? Why does he want Jack?

262
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,445
Retribution.

263
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,283
Retribution for what?

264
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,149
Fayed's brother was part
of the South * embassy,

265
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,322
in Lebanon in 1999.

266
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:41,404
Jack was sent to grab him and get
the names of the other cell members.

267
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,693
Fayed's brother died
while Jack was interrogating him.

268
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:45,896
Now he wants Jack dead.

269
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:47,793
That's right.

270
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:52,344
And you're really gonna just deliver
Jack over to the terrorist to be killed?

271
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,428
- Nadia!
- We need to stop Assad.

272
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,976
But why aren't we organizing a rescue?

273
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:59,450
We can just grab Jack
once Fayed gives us Assad's location.

274
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,776
Fayed has the ressources
to detect our surveillance.

275
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,140
As part of the deal,

276
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,991
we gave Fayed monitoring access
to our satellite coverage,

277
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,145
radio frequences and air corridors.

278
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,229
He won't give us anything
until he's free and clear with Jack.

279
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,390
How do we even know
he'll do what he says?

280
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:14,907
We don't.

281
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,901
I'm calling Karen Hayes.

282
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,099
She'll talk to the President.

283
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,495
Chloe, don't you get it?
Karen already knows.

284
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,327
So does President Palmer,
he authorized it.

285
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,255
Look...

286
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,191
I'm sorry about your friend.

287
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:44,087
But there's nothing you,
I or anyone can do right now.

288
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,065
This is our only way out of this crisis.

289
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:48,453
If we want these attacks to stop,

290
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,514
Jack Bauer has to be sacrificed.

291
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,367
You've only gotten half those upgrades?

292
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,930
You'll get the rest in a minute.

293
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,510
I need them now, Morris.
I needed them 10 minutes ago.

294
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,496
And don't expect Chloe to keep running
interference for you.

295
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:44,675
I'll get your upgrades.

296
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:46,364
When?

297
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,432
What's going on between you and Nadia?

298
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,991
The President got Jack back
from the Chinese.

299
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,323
He's in L.A, now.

300
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,569
Well that's very good news.

301
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:02,631
No, Morris. It's not.

302
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,538
<i>Bill, it's the President.
Is Jack with you?</i>

303
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,256
Yes, sir.
We're almost to the drop point.

304
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,898
<i>Let me speak to him, please.</i>

305
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,428
I'll put him on.

306
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:28,953
It's President Palmer.
He wants to talk you.

307
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,228
Mister President?

308
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,288
I've been...

309
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,699
trying to think
of what I could possibly say to you,

310
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,125
<i>after all that you've sacrificed
for this country,</i>

311
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,991
what you've done for me
in the past and of course,

312
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,721
what you've done for my brother David.

313
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,840
This is a desperate measure, Jack.
Believe me, I know

314
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,069
<i>it's also a measure of our desperation.</i>

315
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:57,952
People are...

316
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:59,346
... afraid to come outside.

317
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,106
They're afraid
to leave their homes, Jack.

318
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,427
They're starting
to turn against each other out there.

319
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,807
Bill Buchanan explained
the situation, sir.

320
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:07,742
I know what's happening.

321
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,002
I understand what's expected of me.

322
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,510
You have my word,

323
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:19,433
my word, Jack.
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

324
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,143
Thank you.

325
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:24,629
<i>God bless you, Jack.</i>

326
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,548
Good bye, M. President.

327
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,829
When I agreed to run
for this office...

328
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:38,276
... I thought that I understood
this job.

329
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,485
I mean I was right beside
my brother David when he had...

330
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:43,915
to make impossible decisions in no time.

331
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,509
When he had to chose
between bad options, but...

332
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,442
Now that I'm the one
sitting in that chair,

333
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,919
I start to wonder if I am
the right person to lead this country.

334
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,050
It's an irrelevant question, sir.

335
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,442
Excuse me ?

336
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,046
You will lead this country,

337
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,258
wether you want to or not.

338
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:06,471
You are the President.

339
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,346
But this president can't shake
the feeling

340
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,092
that sacrificing Jack Bauer
is a mistake.

341
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:18,225
And that maybe I should call
this whole thing off

342
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,084
- before it's too late.
- No, sir.

343
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:22,739
You have not made a mistake.

344
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,663
And for what it's worth...

345
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:29,351
your brother
would be doing just the same thing.

346
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,619
That doesn't make it right.

347
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:32,948
It isn't right...

348
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:34,888
it isn't wrong.

349
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:37,552
It's simply our only option.

350
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:40,334
Bauer has to be sacrificed

351
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,673
so this country can survive.

352
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,994
- I just heard a disturbing rumor.
- And?

353
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,387
What rumor is that?

354
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:02,443
That you're authorizing the National
Guard to set up detention facilities

355
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,279
in conventions centers
and sports arenas in Los Angeles,

356
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,785
Detroit and Philadelphia.

357
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:08,753
Yeah. Well, that's correct.

358
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,020
That's against the President's order.

359
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,518
I was there when he gave it.

360
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:15,820
Karen, I know where you were.
I was standing right next to you.

361
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,811
To my knowledge,
that order hasn't been resended.

362
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,850
All right, you're confused.

363
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,342
I haven't implemented anything yet,

364
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:28,999
I merely positionning
if the President changes his mind,

365
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,463
as I suspect he will,

366
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,895
then we would have wasted less time.

367
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,272
I'm not confused, Tom.
And you can use whatever word you like,

368
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:39,333
in plain English
you're second guessing the President.

369
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,242
Plain English doesn't allow for the new
answers that my job requires, Karen.

370
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,008
And just how far
are you gonna push this?

371
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:48,547
The ACLU is already filing
complaints against us

372
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,693
that we've given the Bureau
too much field authority.

373
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:53,488
And by my lights
they haven't been given near enough.

374
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,575
They need a wider net with tighter mesh.

375
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:58,261
Then what happens when innocent people
get caught in that net?

376
00:21:58,355 --> 00:21:59,717
Well, like I told you before,

377
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,318
security has its price.

378
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:03,572
Just get used to it, Karen.

379
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,057
- Go ahead.
- Secure Bauer's wrist to the grid,

380
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:21,463
then leave him there.

381
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:23,205
First, tell me where Assad is.

382
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:25,263
This isn't a negociation.

383
00:22:25,382 --> 00:22:26,682
If you want Assad,

384
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:30,343
leave Bauer here,
get back in your car and drive away.

385
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,268
I'm watching you.

386
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:36,354
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

387
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:43,024
He wants me to handcuff you
to that grid.

388
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:46,673
Do it.

389
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:04,303
I don't know what to say, Jack.

390
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:10,802
Do you understand the difference
between dying for something

391
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,100
and dying for nothing?

392
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:17,909
The only reason I fought so hard
to stay alive in China

393
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:20,349
was because
I didn't want to die for nothing.

394
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,907
Today...

395
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:28,793
I can die for something.

396
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:32,553
My way, my choice.

397
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,798
To be honest with you
it'll have to be a relief.

398
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,170
I'm sorry, Jack.

399
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:52,810
Don't be.

400
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,052
Bill, you need to go.

401
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,194
Go.

402
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:34,609
<i>Firemen are battling a fire at the
Al-Ham-Sen mosque in Culver City.</i>

403
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:37,951
<i>Members of the mosque
are calling the incident a retaliation</i>

404
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,734
<i>for this morning suicide bombing</i>

405
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,072
<i>that happened downtown on the metro bus.</i>

406
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:43,716
Scott shouldn't be going to school.

407
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,237
He has a geometry test.

408
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:48,921
Honey, L.A. was just hit. I mean
they should be close this schools down.

409
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,835
They will close them down
when it's not safe.

410
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:57,551
But until then,
I don't want to scare our son

411
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,789
and I don't want you scaring him either.

412
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,192
I want us to keep living our lives
as normally as we can.

413
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,875
Look, Gillian...

414
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:07,064
There is nothing normal
in what's happening here.

415
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,457
What are we supposed to do?

416
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:10,815
Just hide inside our house
for the rest of our lives?

417
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:14,544
Hey, was Ahmed able to help?

418
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:17,053
I didn't get a chance to see him.
The FBI are at his house.

419
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:18,499
They're arresting his dad.

420
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:20,458
What?

421
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,614
- Why are they taking him?
- I don't know.

422
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,763
This is insane. You can't arrest
somebody without a reason.

423
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,279
He's not a terrorist.

424
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,131
He's innocent.

425
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:44,085
- It's got to be some reason.
- I'm sure it's a mistake.

426
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,783
Ahmed! What are you doing?

427
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:03,351
We just wanna talk to you, okay?

428
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,841
Ahmed, get outta here!

429
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,361
It's that guy down the block.

430
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:09,798
- A contractor-- Stan Something.
- Yeah, I know.

431
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,269
I'll call the police.

432
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,351
Come on!

433
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,826
Want you to get the hell
out of my neighborhood !

434
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,325
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping Ahmed.

435
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:21,952
- Your father is calling the police.
- They won't do anything.

436
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:23,538
Scott, stop. You're not going over here.

437
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:26,112
Dad, I'm not hiding here
while Ahmed gets beat up

438
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,232
'cause you're scared to do
the right thing.

439
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:30,188
Stay here !

440
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:36,798
I handle it.

441
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:54,649
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Get out of my house.

442
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,139
We're just here to give you
a little friendly advice, okay?

443
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:59,513
Stan ! What the hell are you doing, man?

444
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:02,014
Tryin' to protect my family, Ray.

445
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:03,755
This kid's father is a terrorist.

446
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:06,083
Come on he's no more a terrorist
than you and me.

447
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:08,502
Yeah? Then why did they arrest him?

448
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:09,980
Because they're scared.

449
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,226
- Like everyone else.
- Oh, get outta my way.

450
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,568
Hey, Stan ! Come on ! Stan...

451
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,218
If you want him...

452
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:19,786
you comin' through me.

453
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,292
This isn't over, Ray.

454
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,458
- You all right?
- Yeah.

455
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,710
All right, look, hum, I-I think

456
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,845
what we should do
is you should come stay with us

457
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:47,788
till things get sorted out
with your father.

458
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,737
Look, I appreciate what you just did
but I'll be fine.

459
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:52,233
Look, this guy--
this guy is a jerk

460
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:55,057
and I don't want you staying here alone,
it's dangerous.

461
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,035
I-I'm not taking no for an answer.
You come with me.

462
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,605
- Nadia, Bill Buchanan for you.
- All right.

463
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,171
- Bill?
- <i>Jack's at the drop point.</i>

464
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,459
Are we set with the military?

465
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,178
Marines have 2 cover attack helicopters

466
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,270
ready to deploy we could hit any target
inside L.A. within 20 minutes.

467
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,211
Jack's giving his life
for this operation.

468
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,392
So I dont want any mistakes.

469
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,979
Assad must be taken out
with extreme prejudice.

470
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,518
He will be searched as soon as
we get his location with Fayed.

471
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,591
If Fayed calls before I get back,
loop me in.

472
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:22,622
Yeah.

473
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:24,113
- Bill?
- Yeah?

474
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:28,148
I'm sidelining Chloe on this operation.

475
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,396
Why?

476
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,244
She started asking questions
about Jack.

477
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:34,741
- I-I tried putting her off but...
- What did you tell her?

478
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:36,687
The truth.

479
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:40,215
- I'll talk to her when I get there.
- Thanks.

480
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,346
Move over.

481
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,557
What are you doing?

482
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,960
Gonna try get a visual on Jack.

483
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,306
I told you,
Fayed has our surveillance protocols.

484
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,594
He's monitoring full spectrum radio
satellite orders and transmissions.

485
00:28:57,626 --> 00:29:00,035
I had acces to a satellite
that's off the government's grid.

486
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,112
How?

487
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,149
I did a drop of work
for this energy consortium

488
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:05,777
in Pakistan.
They needed an illegal aerial survey

489
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:07,741
for some oil fields.
I needed some big cash.

490
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:12,913
Look, the little bird--
she's still flying, she's still flying.

491
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:15,342
I think I can reposition
the camera from here.

492
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:19,388
- Morris...
- Ah, don't thank me yet, love

493
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:22,369
Just stop sulking and find out
where Bill Buchanan left Jack.

494
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,465
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

495
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,252
- Yes.
<i>- There is a problem.</i>

496
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,413
Don't move out of the tunnel yet.

497
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:26,811
- What?
<i>- I've just intercepted a signal</i>

498
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:28,596
to a privatly owned satellite.

499
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,786
There are hundreds
of private satellites.

500
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:34,154
The signal is beeing transmitted
on a government frequency.

501
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,958
This satellite, what's it looking at?

502
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,768
I can't pinpoint it but the cameras
has been repositionned to your sector.

503
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:43,969
Connect me to CTU.

504
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,479
Chloe, this is it, this is it!

505
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,843
As soon as the military
has Assad's location,

506
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,944
we'll work with local law enforcement
to limit collateral damage.

507
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:58,187
As much as we are trying
to prevent civilian losses our priority,

508
00:30:58,431 --> 00:30:59,653
just take out Assad.

509
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,667
Fayed is on the line.

510
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:04,872
This is Nadia Yassir.

511
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,710
Redirect the satellite
you have aimed at this sector.

512
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,328
I don't know what you're talking about.

513
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:16,190
Then explain the activity
on frequency Alpha-0-7-0-3.

514
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,613
Bauer is dead either way.

515
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,912
But if you don't redirect that satellite
in 30 seconds,

516
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:23,795
you will loose Assad.

517
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,638
I'm telling you there is no satellite.

518
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:27,375
28 seconds.

519
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,537
Where is this coming from?

520
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,519
- Inside the building.
- Where?

521
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:41,180
Chloe's station.

522
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:45,784
Morris.

523
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:47,917
Redirect that satellite!

524
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,468
- Redirect that satellite!
- Situation is under control.

525
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:52,950
No, Fayed hacked your transmission.

526
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,093
We may have lost our only chance
of locating Assad.

527
00:31:55,168 --> 00:31:57,071
Fayed, this was a rogue operation.

528
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,807
- Redirecting the satellite now.
- You have ten seconds.

529
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,168
- Morris, do it!
- Nine...

530
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:03,852
- Come on, hurry up!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

531
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:05,007
Six...

532
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,435
Five...

533
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:08,014
<i>Four...</i>

534
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,324
It's done.

535
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,334
It's moving away, Fayed.

536
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:14,204
They redirected the satellite.

537
00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:16,441
- Other channels?
- <i>All clear.</i>

538
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:19,486
Because of your deception,

539
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:23,131
I will have to think about
giving you Assad's location.

540
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:25,077
But, what about our deal?

541
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:30,332
Fayed?

542
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:44,958
- We may have spooked Fayed.
- I heard what happened.

543
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,604
Damn it! What were you thinking?

544
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:50,916
It's my fault, you can fire me.

545
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:52,221
I'd fire both of you right now

546
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,185
but I can't afford
to loose the man power.

547
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:00,688
- Look at me.
- I'd rather not, sir.

548
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,173
Look at me.

549
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:08,702
Don't think you're the only one
mourning Jack, you're not.

550
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,038
That may be our only option.

551
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,084
You both better hope to God
you just didn't blow it,

552
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:19,614
we may have sacrificed Jack for nothing.

553
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:43,034
<i>- Buchanan.</i>
- Bill, have you heard from Fayed?

554
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:45,543
- Not yet, no.
- The President's worried.

555
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,867
Fayed should have contacted us by now.

556
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,408
There may be a problem.

557
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,809
There is a possibility
Fayed is going back on the deal.

558
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,693
What are you talking about?

559
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,450
He caught us trying to track Jack.

560
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,683
The orders were
that he was to have a clear field.

561
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:00,271
I know what the orders were.

562
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:03,362
Chloe thought there was a workaround
she did it without our authorization.

563
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,363
Damn it, Bill!
She's your responsability.

564
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,668
How could you let this happen?

565
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:08,519
If we don't take out Assad, then...

566
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,647
I don't need a lecture.

567
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,588
- Karen, I know what the stakes are.
<i>- I don't think you do.</i>

568
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:15,345
If these attacks don't stop,
there are people in this administration

569
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,148
who are willing
to tear up the constitution

570
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,089
in the name of national security.

571
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,683
The things that
they're talking about doing

572
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,088
this country will never recover.

573
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,622
As soon as I hear from Fayed
you'll be my first call.

574
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:31,601
I'm sorry, Bill. It's just, I'm...

575
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,905
There is no need to apologize,
we're all fear*, here.

576
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:38,311
I have to go.

577
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,086
Anything?

578
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:50,711
- Clear
- Are you sure?

579
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,844
Yes, they are leaving us alone.

580
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:56,265
The money's been transfered,
should we call CTU?

581
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:57,430
Not yet.

582
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:17,260
You need to call CTU.

583
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:44,549
I won't let you die until I'm ready.

584
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:47,154
The chinese, they leave much for me
to work with.

585
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,304
But, before you die,

586
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:51,359
you're going to feel
what my brother felt.

587
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,265
I saw his body.

588
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,220
I know how he died.

589
00:35:58,104 --> 00:35:59,692
I know what you did to him.

590
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:10,351
You don't need me to tell you...

591
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,535
that the nerves

592
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,311
are bundled...

593
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,443
here.

594
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:49,719
You need to give CTU Assad's location.

595
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:51,507
That was the deal.

596
00:36:53,114 --> 00:36:54,279
Assad,

597
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:56,741
has lost faith in our fight.

598
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:00,020
He thinks our tactics are failing.

599
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:01,975
He's begun talking about,

600
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,867
compromise.

601
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,532
About laying down our arms
and negociating.

602
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:11,328
But there is no compromise
nor negociation.

603
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:13,827
Assad...

604
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,659
is a traitor.

605
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,732
And soon,

606
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,019
inch’ Allah,

607
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,278
he will be dead.

608
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,511
That's right, Jack.

609
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:29,827
CTU is about to kill their own man.

610
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,018
Assad, isn't behind these attacks.

611
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,111
He's come here to stop them.

612
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:39,507
He's come here,

613
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,866
to stop me.

614
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,224
You will die for nothing.

615
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:14,853
If Fayed doesn't call in 5 minutes,
reassign everyone here.

616
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,752
- This is Buchanan.
- You kept your end of the deal,

617
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,687
- I'll keep mine.
- I'm listening.

618
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:24,639
I have a transponder
at Assad's location.

619
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,960
33-58-11 north latitude.

620
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:33,766
100-18-21-40 west longtitude.

621
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:37,491
You'll find Assad there.

622
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:41,818
- Where is that?
- It's coming.

623
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,485
Inglewood.

624
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,512
Have general Bowen
mobilize the attack helicopters

625
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,155
I'll let the President know we're a go.

626
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,252
Cut off Fayed access
to all our surveillance.

627
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:52,176
I want a lockdown
on all of our satellites.

628
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:53,447
Shut them down, you got it?

629
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:03,516
We did everything we could.

630
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,684
I know it's truly awfull,
but if it stops these attacks,

631
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:12,329
it's for the greater good.

632
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,336
There is no one that understands that
more than Jack.

633
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:44,127
Do you remember doing this
to my brother?

634
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:49,070
- Fayed?
- What is it?

635
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:50,696
There is a call for you.

636
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,227
It's important.

637
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:14,492
Yes?

638
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:15,957
<i>There is a problem.</i>

639
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>- Tell me what happened.</i>
- The FBI,

640
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,965
they took my father.

641
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,014
Where are you?

642
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:25,886
I'm at the neighbours'.

643
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:29,569
Fayed, you know my father is innocent,
he has no idea of what we're doing.

644
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:32,482
If your father is meant
to be sacrificed...

645
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,995
... that is how it will be.

646
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,394
Now, tell me what the FBI said.

647
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,548
Good.

648
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,587
You did the right thing.

649
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:24,566
<i>Are you sure the FBI
didn't find the package?</i>

650
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:28,277
- Yes, it's well hidden.
- You need to deliver it soon.

651
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:37,050
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

652
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:40,377
It was just my uncle he's trying
to find out where they took my dad.

653
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:42,030
- You want to come in?
- Yeah.

654
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,885
Get in there! He got away.

655
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:10,126
Find him!

656
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:58,972

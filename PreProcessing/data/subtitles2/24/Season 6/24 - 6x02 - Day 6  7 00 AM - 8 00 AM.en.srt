<i>Previously on 24...</i> (del vo)

3
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:22,859
Mr. President, my analysts believe
that Assad's organisation

4
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:24,271
cannot survive without him

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,663
and once he's dead,
these attacks will stop.

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,869
CTU needs to eliminate Assad.

7
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,477
That's all there is to it.

8
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,810
God knows we're paying
a steep enough price to get him.

9
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:37,045
We were contacted four days ago
by a man named Fayed.

10
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:40,261
He offered to give us Assad's location
for a list of demands.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,667
And one of them is Jack Bauer.

12
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,447
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself

13
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:45,055
so we can eliminate Assad.

14
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:48,143
The reason why I fought so hard
to stay alive in China

15
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,486
was because I didn't want
to die for nothing.

16
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,427
Today...

17
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,074
I can die for something.

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,917
You kept your end of the deal,
I'll keep mine.

19
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:00,142
I have a transponder
at Assad's location.

20
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:03,362
33-58, 11 north latitude.

21
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,224
100-18-21-40 west longitude.

22
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,475
Have General Bowen
mobilize the attack helicopters.

23
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:11,180
I let know the President know
we're a go.

24
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:14,489
CTU is about to kill the wrong man.

25
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,155
Assad...

26
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,371
isn't behind these attacks.

27
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,469
He's come here to stop them.

28
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,155
He's come here,

29
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:24,656
to stop

30
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:25,806
me.

31
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,321
Get out of my house!

32
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,875
This kid's father is a terrorist.

33
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,302
Oh, come one. He's no more
a terrorist than you and me.

34
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,919
Tell me what happened.

35
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,253
The FBI,

36
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,527
they took my father.

37
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:40,351
<i>Are you sure the FBI
didn't find the package?</i>

38
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,567
Yes, it's well hidden.

39
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:43,430
You need to deliver it soon.

40
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,983
Get in there! Find him!

41
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,896
That way.

42
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,288
We have to go.

43
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,229
Not until we've found Bauer.

44
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,396
We're not here
to kill one American,

45
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:23,758
we're here to kill thousands.

46
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,111
But he knows the truth.

47
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,530
It doesn't matter.

48
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,353
By the time Bauer tells anyone,

49
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:31,510
it will be too late.

50
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:34,363
Assad will be dead and we'll be free
to finish what we started.

51
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:39,106
Fayed, listen to me.

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,753
If we don't leave now,
we'll jeopardize the mission.

53
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,441
Alright.

54
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,516
The target?

55
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:27,850
This is where Fayed
says Assad is right now.

56
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,783
- Do you have any heat signature?
- No, they shield it.

57
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,477
We can't tell how many are in there.

58
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,451
Neither
if there's anyone in there at all.

59
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,231
If Fayed lied to us,

60
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,483
then Jack bought the farm for nothing.

61
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:42,266
Shut up, Milo.

62
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:46,580
What's her problem?

63
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,001
Jack Bauer is a friend of hers.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,580
It hurt her that he died that way.

65
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,771
You might want attenuate
your foolish remarks.

66
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,182
Let's go, Milo.

67
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,146
Two Cobra attack helicopters
have been launched from Camp Pendleton

68
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,244
to hit Assad's location
in fifteen minutes.

69
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,715
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:22,190
- What is it?
- Jack Bauer is calling in. Line 2.

71
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:25,719
Jack, it's Bill.

72
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:27,896
<i>Thank God, you're alive.
What happened? How did you--</i>

73
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,111
Listen to me carefully,
we do not have a lot of time.

74
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,366
I need you to call off
the airstrike against Assad.

75
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,111
- Why?
- You're going after the wrong man.

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,003
Assad is not responsible
for the bombings.

77
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,217
Where did you get this information?

78
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:43,030
It's complicated. I'll explain
as soon as you call off the airstrike.

79
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,295
I don't have the power to resend
a presidential order, you know that!

80
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,636
Then put me through the President.
I'll tell him myself.

81
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:50,500
Bill, trust me!

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,167
Just put me through to the White House.

83
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:54,059
Alright, stay on the line.

84
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,776
<i>I have Bill Buchanan for the President.
Priority 3.</i>

85
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,961
- Put him through, please.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

86
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,157
<i>Mr. President,
there's some new information</i>

87
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,510
<i>you need to consider
regarding the airstrike on Assad.</i>

88
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,922
I'm on the line with Jack Bauer.

89
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,255
<i>He escaped from Fayed.</i>

90
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,192
What?

91
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:19,996
- How?
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

92
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,799
But he's requesting that we abort
the airstike against Assad.

93
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,495
For what possible reason, Bill?

94
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,828
According to him,
Assad is not behind the attacks, sir.

95
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,955
Bill, that's insane.
What is Jack basing this on?

96
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,887
He has an explanation but he wants
to talk directly with the President.

97
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,082
- Put him on.
<i>- You're online with the President.</i>

98
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,033
- Mr. President?
- Jack, I am so sorry--

99
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:39,504
Sorry,
we don't have a lot of time.

100
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,386
Did Bill Buchanan
explain to you about Assad?

101
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,170
Yes, he has. But I have to tell you
we're all sceptical here.

102
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,994
What's Assad doing in this country
if he's not behind these attacks?

103
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,151
He's trying to stop them.
He's trying to stop Fayed.

104
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,210
So, you're saying that Fayed
is carrying out these bombings?

105
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,327
Yes, sir.

106
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,562
Fayed admitted to me

107
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,444
that Assad is planning
to renounce terrorism.

108
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,209
He's trying to mainstream
his organization.

109
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,287
He wants to bring them
into the political process.

110
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,003
Fayed wants to stop that from happening.

111
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,807
Fayed is behind
this recent wave of attacks.

112
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,458
Jack, this is inconsistent
with twenty years

113
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,160
of terrorism on Assad's part.

114
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:11,831
His organisation has waged
non stop war against the West.

115
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,533
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths.

116
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,386
I am aware of Assad's history.

117
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:17,837
<i>And I am still telling you</i>

118
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,161
<i>thats there is sufficient cause
to call off this strike.</i>

119
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:25,455
What if we change the airstrike
to a ground assault?

120
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,239
- I mean, if we capture Assad--
- Sir,

121
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,063
we cannot afford a ground assault.

122
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:30,465
We have to take him out now,

123
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,651
<i>while we've got the chance.</i>

124
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,141
Mr. President, if Jack is right,
we've got the wrong man.

125
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,357
<i>It's a risk we have to take.</i>

126
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:37,945
Jack has been in a Chinese prison
for twenty months.

127
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,176
His habillity to assess this situation
is highly questionable.

128
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,784
I believe he's being played.

129
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:46,255
I know what I heard, Karen.
I am not being played.

130
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,264
Now, all deference to Mr. Bauer,
I think Karen is right.

131
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,765
Mr. President, you want to stop
these attacks, you need to stop Fayed.

132
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,015
And in order to do that,
you need to capture Assad

133
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,485
and find out what he knows.

134
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,798
Sir,
he might be the only hope you have.

135
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,635
Mr. President,

136
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,615
I know your history
with Mr. Bauer runs deep.

137
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:11,007
But don't let that
impact your judgement here.

138
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:18,557
We have the opportunity
to eliminate Assad, we have to take it.

139
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,596
Bill, I want
a real time progress on that airstrike.

140
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,684
I'm sending you
a video uplink down, sir.

141
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,116
Mr. President, don't do this.

142
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:26,508
Jack, I am sorry.

143
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,233
I am.

144
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:38,391
Jack, give me your location,
I'll send a unit to pick you up.

145
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,440
Bill, killing Assad is a mistake.

146
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,989
Right now,
he's your only chance of finding Fayed.

147
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,342
It's the President's call, Jack.

148
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,519
<i>But we'll do all we can
when you get back to CTU.</i>

149
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,717
That will be too late.

150
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,227
Jack, tell me where you are.

151
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,285
KEY IN ADDRESS (del vo)

152
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,482
RECEIVING LOCATION... (del vo)

153
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:19,888
Don't put me on hold again!
I've been on hold for ten minutes!

154
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,573
Just give me the agent in charge.

155
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:22,867
I will wait on the line.

156
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,102
Damm it.

157
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,666
She says they will--
call me back on this number.

158
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,019
But they didn't tell you
where they're holding my father?

159
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,314
No,
they cannot release that information.

160
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,666
<i>Do you have the package?</i>

161
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,823
I'm still at my friend's house
across the street.

162
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:41,019
<i>They helping me find out
where the FBI took my father.</i>

163
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,686
You're not free to talk?

164
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,804
Just tell me if you have the package.

165
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,840
Not yet, but I'll have it soon.

166
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:53,506
There are other people
I could have chosen for this task.

167
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,663
But I chose you.

168
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:57,966
Now, get out of there.

169
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,614
Retrieve the package.

170
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,457
Call me when you have it.

171
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,603
Yes.

172
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,897
I have to go back to my house.
I'm meeting my uncle.

173
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,603
Do you think that's wise?

174
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,741
Are you sure?

175
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,819
- Man, you should stay here.
- No, I'll be fine.

176
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,487
Don't worry. Thank you, for everything.

177
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,310
- Thank you.
- Take care.

178
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,428
Don't worry, sweetheart,
his family is taking care of him now.

179
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:22,781
Ahmed.

180
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,261
Hold on.

181
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,496
Listen, I am sorry.

182
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,374
I can't believe this is happening.

183
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,226
It's like the all world has gone crazy.

184
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:35,579
It's been crazy for a long time,
we just haven't been paying attention.

185
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,893
Yeah, we are now.

186
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,829
You know what?
You should take this.

187
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,810
I got this at a fair in Oregon.
It's supposed to mean good luck.

188
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:54,981
Thank, but I-- I can't take it.

189
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:57,021
Why?

190
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,374
You might need it yourself someday.

191
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,536
<i>Cobra to Zebra 1, lead is cleared out.</i>

192
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,001
<i>Zebra 1 is cleared out.</i>

193
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:19,080
<i>Flight is cleared for immediate
engagement at lead's discretion.</i>

194
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,365
<i>Mr. Buchanan,
please hold for Karen Hayes.</i>

195
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:24,481
- Bill?
<i>- Yes, Karen.</i>

196
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,432
You're also online with the President.

197
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,853
We're monitoring the video feed
of the cobras.

198
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,872
<i>How soon before they hit
Assad's location?</i>

199
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,235
- Five minutes.
- And how soon

200
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:35,176
after the strike can we expect
confirmation that Assad is dead?

201
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,431
Curtis will lead a team
into the target zone.

202
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,832
They'll do a point by point grid search
as soon as the strike is completed.

203
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,068
Thank you.

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,676
<i>We get ready.</i>

205
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,553
<i>... request heading change, 1-5-0.</i>

206
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:11,793
<i>Zebra 1 is heading southwest
through downtown corridor.</i>

207
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:15,136
Approximately three minutes,
fifty seconds till lock on target.

208
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:22,685
Zebra 1 changing 4-2-1-8-3
to a southerly approach of the target.

209
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,283
<i>Roger that, Zebra 1.
1-8-3.</i>

210
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,038
Lock in two minutes, thirty seconds.

211
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,321
Drop the coffee.

212
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,213
Don't move!
Don't even think about it.

213
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:42,938
Where is Assad?

214
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,056
Where is Assad!

215
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,134
Put down your weapon!

216
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,330
I said,
put down your weapon.

217
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,291
- My name is Jack Bauer.
- I know who you are.

218
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,321
This house has been targeted
for military strike.

219
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,340
I need to get you
and your men out of here now.

220
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,670
Check the street.

221
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,572
I came here alone.

222
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,022
I know about Fayed.

223
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,813
I know he's behind the bombings.
I know you're here to stop him.

224
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,091
No one outside.

225
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,502
Fayed has set you up.

226
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,708
He provided CTU
with the coordinates to this house.

227
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:07,777
Kill him, Assad!

228
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:10,189
In a few minutes, it's not gonna matter.
We'll all be dead.

229
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:11,747
Don't listen to him,
it's a trap.

230
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,257
There's a transponder
that's been planted inside this house.

231
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,335
U.S. military's using it
to pinpoint the strike.

232
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:19,296
There is no transponder here.

233
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,217
We've searched the entire house.

234
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,442
One of your men must have it on.

235
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,579
It's the only possible explanation.

236
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,201
One of your men
is working for Fayed.

237
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,289
Have them empty their pockets.

238
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:40,034
Assad, don't listen to him,
he's lying.

239
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,995
Damn it, I'm telling you the truth.

240
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,443
Why else would I be here?

241
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,835
If I wanted to kill you,
I would have come in shooting!

242
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:48,423
Have your men empty their pockets!

243
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:56,314
I'm trying to save your life.

244
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,000
Wait!

245
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,599
Empty your pockets.

246
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,619
- But Assad--
- I said, empty your pockets.

247
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,226
Behind you!

248
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:16,546
Search him!

249
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,937
You betrayed us!

250
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:33,245
No.

251
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,565
You are the one
who betrayed these people.

252
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,598
Assad, we need to leave now.

253
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,696
If you are telling the truth,

254
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,834
you will not need that gun.

255
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,000
Go, Assad! You need to leave.

256
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,491
We'll secure the files.

257
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,040
Hurry up!

258
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,436
Move! Move!

259
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,577
- Are you alright?
- He's been hit.

260
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:15,702
Get him up.

261
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,071
Move.

262
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:21,459
Mister President?

263
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:23,696
<i>The target has been destroyed.</i>

264
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,013
We are an advocacy group.

265
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,764
These people are all volunteers.
They're very good people.

266
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,943
I'm sure they are, sir.

267
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,413
All we're doing is assembling
a working database of names

268
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:47,193
to cross check against our watch list.

269
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,551
Excuse me, Sondra, the FBI is here.

270
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,067
The FBI?

271
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,541
They're asking for access
to our personnel records.

272
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:58,256
We take pride in being good citizens

273
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:00,914
and we will cooperate with you
in order to stop these attacks.

274
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:02,489
May I see your warrant, gentlemen?

275
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:06,596
I'm M. Arvazani's attorney.
I also represent this organization.

276
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,187
We know who you are, ma'am.

277
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,611
And I'm afraid we don't have a warrant.

278
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,793
Then I'm afraid we can't turn over
our personnel records.

279
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:17,312
That information is private,
and their privacy's protected by law.

280
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,632
I understand, ma'am. But in light
of what's happening around the country,

281
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:24,407
we don't think it's unreasonable to ask
for the cooperation of our citizens.

282
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:25,951
You're looking in the wrong place.

283
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,691
There're no terrorists here.

284
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,518
So unless you have a warrant,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

285
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,968
Please, don't make me ask twice.

286
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:41,660
Alright, ma'am.

287
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,316
This is getting out of hand.

288
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,861
Maybe we should give them
what they want.

289
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,184
- You can't be serious.
- We have nothing to hide.

290
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,132
No, but we have something to protect.

291
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,239
The privacy of everyone
who's ever worked for this organization.

292
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,313
Maybe we have to sacrifice
a little privacy.

293
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:01,815
The country is under attack, Sondra.

294
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,294
We cannot pretend it isn't.

295
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,035
Who are you calling?

296
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:08,882
Yes, it's Sondra Palmer.
I'd like to speak with my brother.

297
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,984
We're still sweeping the target zone.

298
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,433
We've recovered four bodies.

299
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:19,652
<i>Forensics are running field ID now.
They're sending data back to CTU.</i>

300
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,505
Well, let's hope one of them is Assad.

301
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,624
<i>The President's sister
is on the line, sir.</i>

302
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,318
Well, I think he'll wanna call her back.

303
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,508
<i>- She says it's urgent.</i>
- I'll take it.

304
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,026
- Mr. President, we're...
- Tom, it's okay.

305
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,095
Let me have the room, please.

306
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,269
What's going on, Sondra?

307
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,456
I'm sorry to burden you with this,

308
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,272
but I think you need to know.

309
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,406
The FBI was just here
and they wanted access

310
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,480
to the IAA's personnel records.

311
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:00,335
Did they say why?

312
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,620
They gave some excuse about
expanding their database.

313
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:07,709
Listen, Sondra.

314
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:13,362
You know I have to do whatever I can
to stop these attacks, right?

315
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:14,618
- Yes.
- Well,

316
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:17,060
that includes giving
law enforcement the authority

317
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:19,055
to follow up on every single lead
they get.

318
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:22,261
That's my point.
They weren't following any lead.

319
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,582
They were invading
a group of people's privacy

320
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,902
based on their religion.

321
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:29,978
Look, Wayne, you know I'm not
some idealistic flag burner,

322
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,828
and I understand
that you're going through

323
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,942
a very complicated situation, but...

324
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:37,911
once your start ethnic profiling,
it's a slippery slope.

325
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,192
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

326
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:41,016
You should probably start
with Tom Linnick.

327
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,494
This has his name written all over.

328
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,424
Sondra, please, don't start it
on Tom again.

329
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:47,354
He treats the constitution
like a list of suggestions.

330
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,015
He's laying the framework
for a major crackdown,

331
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:51,771
and civil protections be damned.

332
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,867
Listen, let's be honest.
You don't like Tom, and you never have!

333
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,055
Neither did David.

334
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,609
<i>Excuse me, sir.
Bill Buchanan's on the line for you.</i>

335
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:08,944
One moment.

336
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:10,389
Sondra, I gotta go.

337
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:13,512
Wayne, look.
I'm sorry to put this on you, okay?

338
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:14,935
I just...

339
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,670
... wouldn't have called
if I didn't think it was important.

340
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,132
I understand.

341
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:25,202
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I love you too.

342
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:31,866
I hope I got through to him.

343
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:34,246
You made a good case,
and he's a good man. He'll listen.

344
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,733
Thanks.

345
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,811
For what?

346
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,927
For making that call,

347
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:49,653
and for not letting me lose sight
of what we're fighting for.

348
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,168
<i>Go ahead, Bill.</i>

349
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:57,493
We completed our sweep
of the strike zone, sir.

350
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,093
<i>Recovered four bodies.</i>

351
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:00,470
<i>None of them is Assad.</i>

352
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,393
- What?
- Are you sure?

353
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,723
<i>We're still checking the site,</i>

354
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,822
<i>but I think it's safe to assume
Assad is alive.</i>

355
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,020
How the hell did we miss him!

356
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,117
We couldn't have, sir.
Someone must have warned him.

357
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:12,944
Or the intel we got from Fayed was bad
and Assad was never there to begin with.

358
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,841
That's irrelevant. What matters now
is that Assad is still out there.

359
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,179
We're sealing a 10 block perimeter
around the area, sir.

360
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,967
Assad may still be in the vicinity.

361
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:21,280
Alright, Bill.

362
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,784
We put everything we had
into that strike.

363
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:29,303
We thought if we could cut off the head,
we could stop these attacks, and now...

364
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,074
Damn.

365
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,726
What do you think Assad's next move
is gonna be?

366
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,738
Likely? There will be more attacks,

367
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,559
but respond, he will, guaranteed.

368
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,395
Talked to Ahmed.
We'll have the package soon.

369
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,456
Good.

370
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,746
- Is he ready?
- Yes. He's waiting for you.

371
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:46,667
It's not necessary.

372
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,402
I will not fail you.

373
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,110
I don’t question your devotion, Nasser.

374
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,694
When the moment approaches,

375
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,913
even the most devout
can experience fear.

376
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,051
Look at me.

377
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:08,970
By overcoming your fear,

378
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,094
you prove your worth.

379
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:20,180
I've been proud to have known you
in this life, Nasser.

380
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,790
Your family will learn
about your sacrifice.

381
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,869
Alright. No more loads.
Let's get outta here.

382
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:03,537
Let's go.

383
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,976
Put him here.

384
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:20,737
He's unconscious.

385
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,795
CTU's gonna realize you weren't killed
in the air strike.

386
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:25,434
They're gonna widen their search grid.

387
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,747
- We can't stay here much longer.
- He knows where Fayed is.

388
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:31,810
I'll only need a few minutes.

389
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,542
Fayed told me that you wanted
to disarm your organization.

390
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:39,214
You're gonna start negociations
with the West. Is that true?

391
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:41,875
I've gotten most of my people
and the governments that support us

392
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,426
to agree to a cease fire with the West.

393
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:45,487
- And that's Fayed wants to sabotage?
- Yes.

394
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,018
Once Fayed is eliminated,

395
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,447
everyone else will fall into line
and I can go public with my proposal.

396
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,982
But finding Fayed
is the key to everything.

397
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,428
I'll be right back.

398
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:24,493
Mr. Buchanan, I know why Assad
wasn't in the building

399
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,670
when the missile hit.
I need to show you something.

400
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:39,284
This is an aerial frame enhancement
of the building

401
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,217
a couple of seconds
before it was destroyed.

402
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,659
Jack rescued Assad.

403
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,078
This makes sense,

404
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,929
from Jack's perspective,

405
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:53,971
if Assad is trying to stop the bombing.

406
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,461
The President Palmer and you wife...

407
00:24:56,725 --> 00:25:00,500
I mean Karen Hayes think he's wrong.
So what am I supposed to do with this?

408
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,117
Who else has seen it?

409
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,079
- Nobody but me.
- Okay. Let's keep it that way for now.

410
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,979
Jack didn't save Assad
out of compassion.

411
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:11,332
He's gonna use him to find Fayed.

412
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:13,775
But if he's right, then we should be
looking for Fayed too.

413
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,805
Right.

414
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:18,972
Refilter the channel trace, see
if we can sort something out on Fayed.

415
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:20,427
- Okay.
- Good work.

416
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,055
We have a car!

417
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:34,493
If we gonna find Fayed in time,
we have to involve CTU.

418
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:37,174
You mean the people who tried
to kill me, who killed 4 of my men!

419
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:38,774
They have resources you don't.

420
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,610
They will lock me in a room
and question me for days!

421
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:46,278
Fayed worked under me for years.
I know how thinks and I will find him,

422
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,558
but I will do it on my terms.

423
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,612
- Where is Fayed?
- I do not know.

424
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:56,691
Where is he?

425
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:58,534
I was just ordered to plant
the transponder.

426
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:09,326
- Where is Fayed?
- I don't know!

427
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,348
Please, stop...

428
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:23,609
Please...

429
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:29,608
Why did you stop?

430
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,644
I can see in his eyes...

431
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,785
He's not gonna tell us anything.

432
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,852
Where is Fayed?

433
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,733
I know where some of his men will be.

434
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,814
I overheard Fayed giving them
instructions to go there.

435
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:06,925
Where?

436
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:09,607
Figueroa and Sixth.

437
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:11,079
When?

438
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:13,281
After you were killed.

439
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:20,171
- You've told me everything?
- Yes.

440
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:21,930
I swear it.

441
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,721
I swear it.

442
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,155
I believe you.

443
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,735
I understand...

444
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,594
... how you felt you were doing
the right thing.

445
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:42,269
I admire your conviction.

446
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:46,309
But you have taken the wrong path,
Shahid.

447
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:51,054
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:01,270
Let's go.

449
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,196
My men are dead.

450
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,956
I can find Fayed.

451
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,153
But I cannot stop him by myself.

452
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,657
I don't know how to do this anymore.

453
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:20,295
You'll remember.

454
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,717
You'd better come out here.
The FBI is back. They have a warrant.

455
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,922
Who is the applicant for this warrant?

456
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,400
I want to see the affidavit.

457
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:54,880
The papers weren't filed
with a district court.

458
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:57,068
We've a legally executive warrant.

459
00:28:57,816 --> 00:29:00,588
Either you hand over the files,
or we take them.

460
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:01,843
It's your choice.

461
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:03,788
This is an administrative warrant.

462
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,757
It's not valid in this situation.

463
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,526
That's your opinion.

464
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,683
They're in the media room.

465
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,197
I'll show you.

466
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,733
I need to use your computer.

467
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,778
Malek. I need copies
of all of our personel files.

468
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,132
- Okay?
- No problem.

469
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,277
What is it?

470
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,022
I can't find the files.

471
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,617
Reset and try again.

472
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,176
- They're not here.
- What do you mean?

473
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,906
They're not
where they are supposed to be.

474
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,519
Because they've been erased.

475
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:21,774
And don't bother trying to recall them,
I used the shredding program.

476
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:23,197
Sondra, what are you doing?

477
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:24,354
Check it.

478
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,237
She's telling the truth.

479
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,965
You're under arrest.

480
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:36,985
Obstructing official business,
destroying evidence.

481
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,328
Take Mr. Arizani into custody.

482
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,504
Wait a minute,
he has nothing to do with this.

483
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:42,661
That's the judge's call.

484
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:45,083
But, I am telling you,
he's not involved!

485
00:30:51,061 --> 00:30:52,493
Are you sure about this?

486
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:56,012
I told you before,
she gets no special treatment.

487
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,145
I know,
but she's the President's sister.

488
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:01,635
We have orders handed down
and we're gonna follow them.

489
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:05,243
Inpound every workstation
and hard drive in this office.

490
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,738
Thought I forgot about you, huh?

491
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:39,250
This is for everyone...

492
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:40,976
you bastards killed today.

493
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,995
How do you like to die?

494
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:50,239
Get up! Get up!

495
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,416
Are you deaf. Didn't you hear me?

496
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:54,612
You're dead.

497
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,594
Please... don't...

498
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:13,045
Please...

499
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,401
Ahmed?

500
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,636
What happened?

501
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,460
What happened?

502
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:47,904
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

503
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,532
We're not calling anybody.

504
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,120
- Ahmed--
- I can't go to the hospital.

505
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:53,931
You're hurt.

506
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:55,421
I'm gonna call 911.

507
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,323
You shouldn't have come here, Scott.

508
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,906
Look, I don't wanna to hurt you.

509
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:06,548
But I will,
unless you do exactly what I say.

510
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:10,341
We're friends.

511
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:12,930
What friends?

512
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,243
You can't even pronounce my name!

513
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,704
It's not "Amed"...

514
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,175
It's A"h"med.

515
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,921
This is the location Amar gave us.

516
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,430
Over there.

517
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,725
Two men in suits.

518
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,352
One carrying a briefcase.

519
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:52,864
He's a Fayed's man.

520
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:54,864
The man in front

521
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:56,707
is wearing an explosive vest.

522
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:58,629
They're setting up another strike.

523
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:04,547
Go!

524
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:16,584
They're going in the subway.

525
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,862
The detonator is in his right hand.

526
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,705
We can't let him get on the train.

527
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:05,077
Only the bomber in getting on the train.
The other man is the handler.

528
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,038
He'll see the bomber off,

529
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:08,523
then, he'll leave.

530
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,445
The handler will lead us to Fayed.

531
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:12,934
You follow the handler,
I'm going after the bomber.

532
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:43,807
- Go ahead.
<i>- He's on the train.</i>

533
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,348
He'll reach Union station in...

534
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:46,446
5 minutes.

535
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:48,250
The moment it pausing,
he'll martyr himself.

536
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:50,718
The car is at the arranged place,
take it.

537
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:53,521
Go to Union station to confirm.
Call me when it's done.

538
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,776
Understood.

539
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:24,854
Thank you.

540
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:27,781
Ticket.

541
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:33,828
Ticket, please.

542
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:48,913
Sir.

543
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,168
Have a ticket?

544
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,198
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.

545
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,413
You have a terrorist
on this train with a bomb.

546
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:55,845
I need you to walk away.

547
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:00,130
If he notices anything unusual,
he will detonate his bomb.

548
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:01,384
Now, move away!

549
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,948
He has a bomb!

550
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:01,345
<i>And the wave of violence
aimed an American target...</i>

551
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:04,639
<i>... the Baltimore's largest
shopping mall...</i>

552
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:06,247
<i>Fayed, something went wrong.</i>

553
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:09,090
I'm here at Union station,
but there's no explosion.

554
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:12,050
And there is a cloud a smoke
four blocks west from here.

555
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,451
Whatever the case,

556
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:19,921
it doesn't matter.

557
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,823
Our other attacks were successfull.

558
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:27,112
Once again, the streets
are flowing with blood.

559
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,961
We're dealing with
3 simultaneous bombings.

560
00:40:33,018 --> 00:40:35,554
1 in a Baltimore shopping mall,
another one in a Chicago hotel.

561
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,699
In both cases,
casualties are expected to be high.

562
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,621
- What about the third one?
- I call you back.

563
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:42,847
It was here, the metro red line.

564
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:44,998
Appears to be a suicide bomber.

565
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,505
Hang on. There may be some good news.

566
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,554
Aside from the bomber,
no one else was killed.

567
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:49,645
How could that happened?

568
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,122
A metro rail employee claims
a passenger jumped to the bomber

569
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:53,494
before he could set off his vest.

570
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:55,663
The passenger identified himself
as Jack Bauer.

571
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,248
Get on the metro sub-net.

572
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,917
Check who was on that train
and who got caught by security camera.

573
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,481
I want a visual confirmation
before I speak to the President.

574
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:05,226
Yes, sir.

575
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:06,978
Sir? You need to hear this.

576
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:10,024
It's a cell phone call. Write tagged
from the NSA surveillance software.

577
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:11,289
<i>Fayed, something went wrong.</i>

578
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,250
<i>I'm here at Union Station, but...</i>

579
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,709
I think we need
to contact the White House.

580
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:18,986
<i>... bomb outside the hotel
was detonated by remote control.</i>

581
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:22,326
<i>sending bodies falling out of windows
from as high as the 21th floor.</i>

582
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:24,777
Mr. President, if it's any consolation,

583
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:27,936
these attacks were planned far
in advance of the raid on Assad.

584
00:41:27,937 --> 00:41:30,314
Tom, all that means
is there will be more attacks.

585
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:34,090
We're in a full blown war here,
and we still have no way to fight back.

586
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,905
Excuse me. M. President...

587
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:40,713
CTU just called.

588
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,726
They intercepted a cell phone call
between Fayed

589
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,068
and one of the men
behind today's bombings.

590
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:48,482
Fayed?

591
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:50,731
Are they sure?

592
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:52,203
Yes, sir.

593
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:56,079
Fayed is the one behind these attacks.

594
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,686
Not Assad.

595
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,750
Sir...

596
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:06,227
... I promoted the strike against Assad.

597
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:07,670
But I approved it, Karen.

598
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,012
We were all in agreement.

599
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,736
So, Jack was right.

600
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:21,047
He was right all along and I...

601
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,474
This is gonna get much worse.

602
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,883
- Yeah?
- What happened?

603
00:42:53,884 --> 00:42:56,317
I'll explain later.
Are you still following the handler?

604
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:57,352
Yes. I'm in the car.

605
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,331
We're in Alameida,
2 blocks from Union Station.

606
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:00,655
We're heading in your direction.

607
00:43:00,656 --> 00:43:01,841
Copy that, I'll find you.

608
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,434
Just stay with handler.
He's our only connection to Fayed!

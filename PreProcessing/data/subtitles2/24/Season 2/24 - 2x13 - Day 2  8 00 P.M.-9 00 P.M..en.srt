1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,326
Jack Bauer's interrogating
Syed Ali as we speak.

2
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:21,770
We'll be informed of his progress on
a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet.

3
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,413
We're certain he knows
the location of the bomb?

4
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,883
- Jack Bauer is.
- Make sure he has all the resources he needs.

5
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:31,170
They will kill your family
if you don't tell me where the bomb is.

6
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:34,529
Where's the bomb?
Tell me where the bomb is!

7
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,127
- Kill him.
- No! No!

8
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,248
- I will tell you!
- Hold on!

9
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,244
- It's Jack.
- What do you have?

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,723
The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
They're gonna fly it over the city.

11
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,850
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me.

12
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,131
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton
is involved? He knew about this bomb?

13
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:56,125
Roger's more involved
than David could possibly know.

14
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:58,408
I think you orchestrated all of this.

15
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:02,327
You have your own and not the president's
best interest at heart.

16
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:05,132
I got into a car accident. I started running.

17
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,681
Before I knew it, I had no idea where I was.

18
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,287
I wanna get back to the highway
and get outta here.

19
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:13,490
The highway's a couple of miles that way.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,124
But the way there is not safe at night.
My place is a half-mile that way.

21
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:21,011
I can put a roof
over your head for the night.

22
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:25,006
They've found Reza, haven't they?
They know what's happened.

23
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,243
Tell me, please, what happened?

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:32,009
You wouldn't understand, Kate.
People have to die for things to change.

25
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,324
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is Tony.

26
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:01,450
- You're about ten minutes from the airport?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:05,162
- You got a tail number on the aircraft yet?
- Not yet.

28
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:08,245
You'll link up with the assault team.

29
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,642
They're starting to lock the grounds down.

30
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:14,043
OK, that sounds good.
Tony, have you contacted Kim yet?

31
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:19,207
No, I haven't. I called the sheriffs station.
They sent out search teams.

32
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,648
I don't know why she hasn't contacted us.

33
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:25,692
She can't go back to LA, and the LAPD's
looking for a murder suspect.

34
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,607
She's not gonna reach out to us.
We've gotta find her. Understand?

35
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:35,643
- I'm putting every resource on it.
- Do everything you have to. Thanks.

36
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,770
- How much further is it?
- Not much.

37
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,885
Ow. Ow! Damn it.

38
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,203
Here, let me see that.

39
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:55,443
We really ought to get you to a doctor.

40
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:59,651
No, I told you, it's not safe for me in LA.

41
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,806
Because people there think
you did something you didn't do?

42
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,884
Yeah, that's right.

43
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:10,805
- You don't believe me.
- It doesn't matter.

44
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:14,886
You don't wanna go back to LA.
That's good enough for me.

45
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,844
There it is.

46
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:54,323
Ready to tell me everything I need to know?

47
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,564
Continue.

48
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,963
We knew about the bomb... weeks ago.

49
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,522
Thank you, Simmons.

50
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,362
What do you mean, "knew"?

51
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,442
We let it in the country.

52
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,932
Tracked it all the way.

53
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,201
We allowed it to sneak through customs,

54
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:46,321
and we allowed the Second Wave terrorist cell

55
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:49,405
to operate... unimpeded.

56
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,848
God, Roger. A nuclear bomb?

57
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:56,927
There's no chance that this bomb
is ever gonna go off.

58
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:59,004
There never was.

59
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:03,371
We had a Special Ops team
following it every step of the way.

60
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,444
Colonel Samuels' team.

61
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,841
The mission was to take
the bomb out of play...

62
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,122
at the last possible moment.

63
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,410
What are you trying to do?
Start a war with the Middle East?

64
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,923
- No.
- Then what?

65
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,608
Your defence policy is too passive.

66
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,402
- You need more resources.
- You're trying to hijack my presidency.

67
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:33,769
No, no, no. I'd like to give it some balls.

68
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:38,802
You're gonna call your Special Ops team.
Tell them to secure the bomb. Now!

69
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,808
They went dark three hours ago.

70
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:49,729
Not accepting any new incoming
communications till the mission's complete.

71
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,883
And where were they?

72
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,523
Where were they?

73
00:05:56,413 --> 00:06:00,452
Norton Airfield... Los Angeles.

74
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,928
The shower's in there.
You're welcome to use it.

75
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:14,932
Try not to stay in there too long.
There's not a lot of hot water.

76
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:21,805
There's some towels in there,
and I'll try and get you some clean clothes.

77
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:27,003
The door has a lock.

78
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,811
Thanks.

79
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,443
I just got off the phone with Division.

80
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:49,924
Syed Ali named three more
Second Wave terrorists in the LA area.

81
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:53,369
I want two transport teams assigned
to each one. Pick 'em up now.

82
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,091
OK.

83
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:05,603
Hey, guys, heads up. They just received
a second confirmation from NSA in Oregon.

84
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,571
The location of the bomb
is indeed Norton Airfield.

85
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:13,169
Jack Bauer's en route. I want every
available field agent over there now.

86
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,851
- This is Bauer.
- There's a new wrinkle, Jack.

87
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,130
- How far are you from the airport?
- A couple of minutes.

88
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:43,283
What kind of a wrinkle?

89
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:49,084
There's a hostile US paramilitary unit
standing between you and the bomb.

90
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:52,609
A Coral Snake team headed up
by Colonel Ron Samuels.

91
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,969
It's the same unit that took out our plane.
What is going on?

92
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,851
Why is a US military unit
aiding these terrorists?

93
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,924
As far as we know, they're not.

94
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:05,052
The best we can make out,
they wanna be the ones to secure the bomb.

95
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,364
They'll treat anybody
who stands in their way as an adversary.

96
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:11,286
Order Colonel Samuels
to tell his team to stand down.

97
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,409
They went dark three hours ago.

98
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,485
They're a rogue unit,
acting on their own authority.

99
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,326
- How do I find them?
- I wish I could narrow it down.

100
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,290
Just somewhere at the airport.

101
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,649
I'm trying to get manpower
up from Camp Pendleton.

102
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,132
This is bad, George.

103
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:31,571
Yeah, it is. Our best bet is still
you getting past them to the bomb.

104
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,644
Yes, I understand.

105
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,482
What's happening?

106
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:43,363
I don't know yet. CTU hasn't
been able to locate your sister.

107
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:48,129
As soon as they do, they'll contact me. Sorry.
This is gonna take longer than I thought.

108
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,482
Omar!

109
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,048
Dispatch, this is 4827...

110
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,250
Kate...

111
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:56,932
You've seen terrible things today, but I need
you a little longer, in case we find your sister.

112
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,208
Are you OK with that?

113
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:03,406
- Agent Baker.
- Jack.

114
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:07,122
Take Miss Warner to the secured area,
make sure she's comfortable.

115
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:09,363
You'll need this.

116
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,444
Thank you.

117
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,722
Jack Bauer. Steve Goodrich.
I'm heading up the assault team on-site.

118
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,805
I was told you have
further intel on the group?

119
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:27,206
These are individual military records of
every soldier under Samuels' command.

120
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,764
- What's our profile with them?
- They're gonna treat us like hostiles.

121
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,765
- That doesn't make sense.
- No, but that's the situation.

122
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:36,764
- Is your team ready?
- Inside.

123
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,162
We got airport schematics.

124
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:41,892
Good. Everybody gather round!

125
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,528
We are going to be engaging hostiles
in a large uncontrolled area.

126
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,128
I want everyone wearing
ID tags, no exceptions.

127
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:53,046
Anybody wants to leave this area,
check with me first.

128
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:56,364
- Who's got the schematics?
- Here, sir.

129
00:10:56,453 --> 00:11:01,083
Here's the situation: there is
a nuclear warhead somewhere on-site.

130
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:04,290
There's an armed Delta team surrounding it.

131
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,367
I want three sub-units. Unit one makes the
first sweep. Unit two coordinates air tactical.

132
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:13,731
Unit three will await my command as soon
as I've got a 20 on the bomb. Understand?

133
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:15,212
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:20,048
Good luck, gentlemen.
Lieutenant, set up your teams.

135
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:25,964
Gentlemen, team A, B.
Column of two on me. Let's go.

136
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:40,492
Bauer's set up the staging area at the airfield.

137
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:41,688
OK.

138
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,206
- Tony, we got a little problem.
- What's up?

139
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,853
Brad Hammond from Division is on his way.

140
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,367
They want to shut us down
and run everything.

141
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:52,966
We're up and running now.

142
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,329
Not 100%. We're still having
intermittent packet loss.

143
00:11:56,413 --> 00:12:01,931
Division's uncomfortable with us running
this operation out of a compromised location.

144
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:06,768
We don't have the time to give these idiots
the grand tour. We're closing in on this.

145
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:11,051
They're on their way,
so we just gotta deal with it.

146
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,570
Hey. How you feeling?

147
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:53,451
- A lot better. Thank you.
- Have a seat.

148
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:02,688
So why is it that you live up here like this?

149
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:06,209
I don't know. I guess I just got
sick of the whole LA scene.

150
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:10,843
It's not like I hate anyone there.
There's just too many people.

151
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,401
Don't have that problem up here, huh?

152
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,768
No, it's just the opposite.

153
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:20,165
So, why don’t you move to a small town?
Why do you have to be by yourself?

154
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:22,164
I don't know.

155
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:25,848
So, tell me again
why you can't go back to LA.

156
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,683
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me, so...

157
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,128
What?

158
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:39,086
My father works for the government.
A counter-terrorist unit.

159
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:45,612
He said that someone's gonna detonate
a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.

160
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,331
What's so funny?

161
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:52,851
I knew it. I've been telling people
that this is gonna happen for over a year.

162
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,322
No one would listen to me.

163
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,450
So, you knew about these terrorists?

164
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:05,970
Not these ones specifically, but yeah.

165
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,968
Read the foreign papers. Look over the fence.
The whole world hates America.

166
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,283
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

167
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,563
Don't worry. We're far enough away.
We won't get hurt.

168
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,725
No one's far enough away.
What about the fallout?

169
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:31,409
No one can predict
where the wind's gonna take it.

170
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:35,168
I'm gonna show you something,
but you can't tell anyone.

171
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,764
What is it?

172
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:40,764
After we eat.

173
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:51,526
Where are we on locating
the Coral Snake commandos?

174
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:53,808
Bauer and his teams are looking for them.

175
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,647
- CTU is updating us every ten minutes.
- Good.

176
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,088
This cannot possibly have a good outcome.

177
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:04,803
We've got two highly trained
American military groups about to face off.

178
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,770
CTU has a formable presence.

179
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:11,369
If the commandos are there,
CTU should be able to control the situation.

180
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,684
- Mr President, we've got something new.
- What?

181
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:18,891
Our com team discovered a covert link
between Stanton and Bruce Gluck.

182
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,964
- The Michigan senator?
- Yes.

183
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:27,049
It looks like they were working together.
How would you like to proceed?

184
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,170
Sherry knows Gluck and his key staffers.

185
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:35,451
They worked closely together
during the primaries. Bring her in.

186
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,847
Here? Into the OC?

187
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:42,209
Yes. She'll need access
to our secure databases.

188
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:48,402
- Sir, I feel I must...
- I don't wanna argue about this.

189
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,802
Just do it.

190
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,323
Why's it taking so long to get this number?

191
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:14,086
Barely anything here. There's something...

192
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,324
- We need this, Randy. Come on.
- I'm on it.

193
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:22,533
They're sending Division to do an evaluation.
Why are they doing this now?

194
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:26,288
We're operational, getting results.
Why don't they leave us alone?

195
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:31,128
They will. This is just Chapelle's
way of doing stuff over there.

196
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,527
What about George?

197
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:39,528
When they get a look at the shape he's in,
they're probably gonna yank him.

198
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:45,047
I'm keeping an eye on him, all right?
Just get everyone to Norton.

199
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:03,482
What have we got?

200
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:07,805
Military-issue combat boots. Five sets,
all leading in here, less than an hour old.

201
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,612
- Anything coming out?
- Still in there.

202
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,253
Have your team ready to move on my signal.

203
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,167
It's definitely Colonel Samuels' men.

204
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:06,485
If these guys are dead,
who's tracking the bomb?

205
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:20,612
This is Baker. Copy that.
We're moving into position now.

206
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:49,048
This bank was knocked out,
but we didn't lose any data.

207
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,522
The same data is mirrored at Division.

208
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:55,401
We don't need to risk running
these operations from a jury-rigged system.

209
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,212
You can't run a mission on data alone.

210
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:02,081
My team has more experience
implementing than anyone at Division.

211
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:06,212
I don't think that’s true, but the point is moot.

212
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,091
Start to ship some of
your people to our offices.

213
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:13,166
And waste an hour on transporting and
set up, with a nuclear bomb ticking away?

214
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,767
I was wondering if this place had a director.

215
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,572
- Brad, good to see you.
- George.

216
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,844
I heard you're not feeling well.

217
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,367
I imagine you've heard
all kinds of things today.

218
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:30,004
But a bad day for me is better than a good
day for anybody on your side of the freeway.

219
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,924
- That right?
- We're not shutting down.

220
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,971
We got way too many
active protocols in play here.

221
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,408
Your systems failed
their checks this morning.

222
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:39,609
This morning. Everything's fine now.

223
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:44,721
Eileen, show Brad here how our systems
are exceeding all of their time horizons.

224
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,212
Yes, sir.

225
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:49,205
Think you can do that at Division?

226
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:53,684
Don't believe everything
you hear, Brad. Thank you.

227
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:14,052
- Come on.
- What is it?

228
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,249
You'll see.

229
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:26,322
- I'm not sure, Lonnie.
- Come on, don't be scared.

230
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,124
Come on.

231
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,528
Watch your head over here.

232
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,164
It's a bomb shelter.

233
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:04,763
Short of a direct hit, you could survive
down here for a pretty long time.

234
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,931
- You did all this yourself?
- It took me two years.

235
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,891
After I dug it out, it wasn't too bad.

236
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:17,967
Hey, check it out. I'm kind of a coffee junkie.

237
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,568
I could pretty much handle anything,
but I gotta have my java.

238
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:25,089
These beans are from Argentina.
Here, smell this.

239
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,932
Wow.

240
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,685
- That's great.
- The best.

241
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,287
Mm, that's my favourite smell.

242
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:52,164
Hey! Hey!

243
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:56,362
Hey! Where are you going?

244
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,370
Kim!

245
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,644
What's wrong?

246
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:13,726
I just got a little claustrophobic
down there, that's all.

247
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,202
You're shaking. Are you OK?

248
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:20,363
- I don't think I should be here, Lonnie.
- Why not?

249
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:24,810
I don't know you, and you live here by
yourself with a bomb shelter with guns...

250
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:30,013
Think about it, Kim. It's gonna be
people like me who'll survive today...

251
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,482
if what you say is true.

252
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:38,728
- Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
- You didn't.

253
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:42,362
A lot has happened to me today,
and with the bomb in LA,

254
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:46,969
I just think I need to go
to my Aunt Carol's to be with family.

255
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:58,127
Whatever, Kim. If you gotta go, go.

256
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:22,249
The green card will give you
access to the system rooms,

257
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,325
and the red card will get you into the network.

258
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,607
Thank you, Lynne.

259
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:31,121
I'm sorry you weren't able
to gain access to the OC earlier.

260
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:43,162
What made the president change his mind?

261
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:45,403
I'll let the president fill you in.

262
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:49,088
I'd like to make it clear that
you are not to interface directly

263
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:51,289
with the personnel once inside the OC.

264
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,933
Please see me if you need anything.

265
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:58,882
- You want me to run everything by you?
- I'm familiar with the internal politics.

266
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:02,568
- I'd be able...
- You'll be able to do what, Lynne?

267
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:05,406
I'm trying to maintain some form of protocol.

268
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:08,326
No, you're trying to position yourself

269
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:11,530
between me and David's inner circle
because you don't trust me.

270
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:16,289
Instead of talking about protocols, just say
what's on your mind. You don't want me here.

271
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:18,762
- Mrs Palmer...
- No, you don't me here.

272
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,684
So let's just quit playing games.

273
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:24,209
How dare you speak to me like this.

274
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:29,686
I was appointed by the president because
of my qualifications in foreign policy.

275
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:33,368
I don't know what makes you think
you can lecture me.

276
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:36,286
Fine. You don't wanna play games?

277
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:39,524
I don't like you.
And I don't like you being here.

278
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:47,493
Now we're communicating.

279
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:19,882
All right. You should have
everything you need here.

280
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:23,488
- Thanks. I'll get it back to you.
- Don't worry about it.

281
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:26,645
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

282
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,930
Stay close to me.
It's a 15-minute walk to the highway.

283
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,007
- What was that?
- I don't know.

284
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:39,326
It's Mike Kramer, the park ranger.

285
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,485
He's probably looking for you.

286
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:46,246
The police probably called him.

287
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:51,207
- What do you want me to do?
- They're gonna send me back to LA.

288
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,243
Lonnie.

289
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,130
Hey, Mike.

290
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:06,127
- What's up?
- Following up on a missing person's call.

291
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:08,966
- Seen anyone tonight?
- No. Who are you looking for?

292
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:12,250
A teenage girl.
She ran away from a car accident.

293
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:17,566
- Why would they be looking out here?
- Cos she was in custody.

294
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:21,089
- In custody? For what?
- Kidnapping and murder.

295
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,765
Wow.

296
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:33,048
- You got company?
- What? No, no.

297
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,886
Doug came by earlier.
I haven't cleaned up yet.

298
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:38,567
- Doug O'Keefe from the fire district?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:43,010
- I heard he was still mad after last week.
- It was just a card game.

300
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:45,482
You emptied his wallet.

301
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:52,328
- Keep your eyes open, OK?
- I will.

302
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:54,404
I'll see ya, pal.

303
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:06,605
- Don't worry. He's gone.
- Thank you.

304
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:15,092
Kidnapping? Murder?

305
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:18,008
I didn't do it, I swear.

306
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:25,201
Can we hang out here for a few more minutes,
till he clears the area?

307
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,761
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

308
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:32,844
Hey, Lonnie?

309
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:41,242
I'm really lucky that you were here.
You've been a really good friend. Thank you.

310
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:47,851
Find out about Glock's relationship
with Stanton.

311
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:52,131
I'm interested in any meetings that
both Rayburn and Stanton attended.

312
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:54,807
Fine. I know exactly who to call.

313
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:58,169
Good. I'll have Lynne
set you up with a work space.

314
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:03,008
That's great. Lynne's been quite helpful. I...

315
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:06,812
- I wanna thank you, David.
- For what?

316
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,805
I know how difficult it is
to get clearance in here,

317
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:12,361
and I'm certain your advisors don't want me...

318
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:15,650
Sherry, stop distilling
everything down to politics.

319
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:20,327
We have a need for information.
Hopefully you can fill it.

320
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:24,201
And I will... Mr President.

321
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:27,408
Sherry, I'm sorry.

322
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:32,812
I didn't mean to sound rude.
I really do appreciate what you’re doing.

323
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:35,168
That's why you're here.

324
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:36,972
Mr President.

325
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:41,092
- Yes, Mike.
- I just got off with CTU Los Angeles.

326
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:43,892
Jack Bauer found
the Coral Snake commandos.

327
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:47,010
- So it's over?
- I'm afraid not.

328
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:52,121
All six members of the team
had been killed before Bauer got there.

329
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,602
What about the bomb?

330
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:08,808
Roger, your men are all dead,
and there's no sign of the bomb.

331
00:30:10,773 --> 00:30:12,809
That's not possible.

332
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:15,282
Your insane plan backfired.

333
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:19,730
Those men were our last chance to
find the bomb, and now they’re dead.

334
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,531
My God.

335
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:26,084
You're misguided, but you are not crazy.
You do not want this bomb to go off!

336
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,162
Of course not.

337
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:30,131
Then tell me, who else
could have known about this?

338
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,689
No one. They were on their own.

339
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:36,492
Somebody killed
six highly trained commandos.

340
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:39,292
That's not the work of
a bunch of suicide bombers!

341
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,887
- Six commandos?
- That's right.

342
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,929
There were seven.

343
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:51,325
- What's the word at the airport?
- There's too many places it could be.

344
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:56,203
Got it. It's either N34G5, or it's N34G6.

345
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:59,126
- Michelle.
- I'm on it.

346
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:04,731
N34G5. It's registered in California,
and it's at Norton Airport, hangar MD7.

347
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:06,804
Get Bauer.

348
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,849
Down the runway to here,
then to these hangars all down here.

349
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,566
- Bauer.
- It's Tony.

350
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:20,329
We got a tail number on that plane. N as in
"November", three, four, G as in "golf", five.

351
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,964
The FAA has got it spotted in hangar M
as in "mama", D as in "delta", seven.

352
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:27,362
OK. We got it. Let's go.

353
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,962
Hangar MD7 at the other end of the airport.

354
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,923
The third hangar from the end.

355
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:44,492
There it is! Go, go!

356
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:54,646
He's trying to make a run for the north
runway. Send a team over to cut him off!

357
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,527
Pull up alongside of him!

358
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,764
Damn it!

359
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:56,528
The pilot has been hit!
The pilot has been hit!

360
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,684
Put your hands in the air!

361
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:24,688
Put your hands up!
Put your hands above your head!

362
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:29,803
Keep your hands up!

363
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:37,565
He's got it in the plane!
Get the nuke emergency team here now!

364
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:56,329
You're clear until the threat passes.
When it does, we're gonna re-evaluate.

365
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,085
Fine.

366
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,771
See somebody about that cough.
You don't look so good.

367
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,526
Appreciate your concern, Brad.

368
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:22,890
Lonnie, what are you doing?
What are you listening to?

369
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:27,922
Police band. I'm just scanning to see
if there's anything about your APB.

370
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:32,928
I'd hate to get you out there and then find out
there's a roadblock and a bunch of cop cars.

371
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:35,607
- Find anything?
- Nothing yet.

372
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,365
Good.

373
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:41,526
Looks like you're not gonna
make the Ten Most Wanted.

374
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:48,846
- Oh, my God.
- What?

375
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:50,966
Wait, wait.

376
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:57,011
- It can't be.
- What is it? What's wrong?

377
00:35:57,093 --> 00:36:00,403
- It happened.
- What? The bomb went off?

378
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:04,964
All the LA stations went to static.
Ventura County's talking about a flash.

379
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:07,806
- Now they’re gone.
- I don't see anything.

380
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,283
Here, here. Listen for yourself.

381
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:17,882
This station, nothing. This one, nothing.

382
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,692
This one, nothing. They're all dead.

383
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:23,765
- I gotta get to my dad.
- No, we can't stay up here.

384
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,367
- The radiation. We gotta get down below.
- No!

385
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:30,492
We gotta go now, before it's too late.
Come on.

386
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:31,608
OK.

387
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,643
This is Paul Tate live from the Skywatch.

388
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:02,123
A beautiful night in Los Angeles
as we near the nine o'clock hour.

389
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,488
Traffic is light in both directions.

390
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:08,809
- Try the internal.
- Give it to me.

391
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:16,961
It's no good, either. It's no good.
This trigger's been set to permanent default.

392
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:20,329
We can try the internal configuration.

393
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,088
- What's going on?
- They wiped out the configurations.

394
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:28,643
- Can you disarm it?
- It doesn't look good.

395
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:32,487
Team A, this is Bauer. I want you
to start to clear the north runway.

396
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:35,610
- I repeat: clear the north runway.
- What do you mean?

397
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:39,242
If we can't diffuse it, I've gotta get it
as far away from LA as possible.

398
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,643
- Yes, that's affirmative.
- Roger that.

399
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:52,728
What's happening?

400
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:56,806
Timing mechanism.
They must've given it an expedite command.

401
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:59,965
When it's tampered with,
the countdown speeds up.

402
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:06,444
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

403
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,769
Wait a minute. Don't touch that. It'll detonate.

404
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,452
What just happened?

405
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:30,082
Nothing. This isn't a bomb.
It's been rigged to look like one.

406
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:32,846
- And the radiation reading?
- Probably the box.

407
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:35,891
There was a bomb in here recently,
but it's gone now.

408
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:39,648
The reading's picking up
some plutonium residue.

409
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:43,487
All teams, we do not have the bomb.
This is a decoy.

410
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:46,167
I repeat: we do not have the bomb.
This is a decoy.

411
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:49,928
We are still looking for the nuclear device.

412
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,931
There's no bomb at the airport, Roger.

413
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:44,723
If there's something that you haven't
told me that could save lives...

414
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:49,447
tell me now.

415
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,685
Please, Roger.

416
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,723
Ask Sherry.

417
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,688
What did you say?

418
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:10,528
Sherry... is the one you wanna talk to.

419

1
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:07,431
- What's the deal on this hit man?
- Independent contractor.

2
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:09,629
Rumour is, he got into town last night.

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:12,625
- The guy who did the Rivera hit last year?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:13,987
Sorry.

5
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,792
- Hey, Max. I didn't hear you come in.
- How's it going?

6
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:17,908
Hey.

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:22,111
- Just came by to cadge some coffee.
- Sorry. The market's been out for a week.

8
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:26,744
Ironic, considering Seattle was the coffee
capital of North America back in the day.

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,712
Sounds like you got a situation.
Who are the bad guys looking to whack?

10
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:33,626
Not sure yet, but you can bet
it's one of the good guys.

11
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:38,070
- What do you need me to do?
- Don't worry. We got it covered.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,151
Me and S1W are gonna do some recon,
narrow the list of potential targets.

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,508
I didn't want you to worry about it.
I know you got your plate full these days.

14
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:53,029
Yeah. Well, good luck. I gotta jet.

15
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:58,265
What are you doin' later on?
There's a party at Crash. It's Halloween.

16
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:02,864
We'll probably be working on this all night.

17
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:04,432
OK. Later.

18
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:12,551
- So blondie was there at 8am?
- Gotta get up early to save the world.

19
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:17,625
Don't go there. You should see them
together. They're so into their hero stuff.

20
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:19,704
Hot run.

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,267
Hello? People?

22
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:27,106
Hello!

23
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,863
Great. I'm talking to myself.

24
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:34,741
687 Magnolia. Take off that get-up.
You look like a weirdo.

25
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,425
For your information,
I am the shape of things to come.

26
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:42,188
Demons, mutants, monsters, creatures
not of this world, walking among us.

27
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:44,741
It says so right here.

28
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,269
- What is this falderal?
- The press follow-up on the Eyes Only story

29
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:55,471
about the Manticore escapees. Everything
the government doesn't want you to know.

30
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,192
You have an ass for a head.
Now, bip-bip-bip.

31
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,865
It's three o'clock.

32
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,786
That's the time.
D'you wanna give me the weather?

33
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,070
It's Halloween.
The whole town's shuttin' down early.

34
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:09,748
- It's just another business day to me.
- I'm not hearing it.

35
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,587
- Why you gotta be so salty?
- Whine all you like in that illiterate dialect,

36
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:16,426
but we're not closing early. Capeesh?

37
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:22,509
Normal, when it comes to a test of wills,
you're gonna win hands down.

38
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:25,505
- Cos you the man.
- But at what price?

39
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:31,385
You're gonna lose half a day tomorrow easy,
just gettin' the toilet paper off the building.

40
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:41,423
All right. Last run today
will be at four o'clock.

41
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:44,550
But I want all of you
in here extra early tomorrow.

42
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,866
Losers.

43
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,991
Max.

44
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,586
- Hey.
- How's it goin'?

45
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,868
Just another day in a broken world.

46
00:02:55,953 --> 00:03:00,151
Yeah. There's a party tonight at Crash.
I was wondering if you were gonna go.

47
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,031
- Thinkin' on it.
- So maybe I'll catch you there.

48
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,145
Maybe.

49
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,827
- What did your boy want?
- To hang out.

50
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:15,268
- And you said?
- Maybe.

51
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:18,743
Maybe. That is a sign of mental health.

52
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,551
I ever tell you ladies the one about
the priest, the minister and the rabbi?

53
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,023
- Every day, Murray, every day.
- Good one.

54
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:32,106
- What are you gonna go as tonight?
- Either Snow Ho and the Seven Little Pimps

55
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:35,947
or Rick James. I'm thinkin' Super Freak,
but depends on the curl activator.

56
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,866
Can we go by Joshua's?
I've got groceries to drop off.

57
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,591
Let's say hey to doggy-dog.

58
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:27,429
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

59
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,504
Then she escaped.

60
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:34,030
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

61
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:36,468
she is haunted by her past.

62
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:41,547
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

63
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,547
Trick or treat? Did I scare you?

64
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,948
Why they call it Halloween, boo.

65
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:40,390
So, you got candy?
Me and my crew have got a carton of eggs.

66
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:42,905
Here's five bucks. Beat it.

67
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,464
Cool costume, mister.

68
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:50,022
Are you all right?

69
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:04,423
I used to live in a crib kinda like this
with a Dominican sister named Veronica.

70
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:06,743
Aye, mommy.

71
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,542
Joshua, we can't stay too long.
We're going out tonight.

72
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:18,151
Halloween.

73
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,183
"Cool costume, mister."

74
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:27,541
Max and Joshua,
outside with up-there people.

75
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,589
- No.
- Yes.

76
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,584
Do you wanna end up in a cage?

77
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:35,063
Lived in cage. Down there, cage. Basement.

78
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:39,351
No, a real cage, like an animal in a zoo.
That's if they don't just kill you.

79
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:46,510
Tonight, up-here people look like Joshua.

80
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,709
Tonight, safe.

81
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:52,987
He's got a point. Halloween's
the one night when he can get his swerve on.

82
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:55,826
Get my swerve on. Tricks and treats.

83
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,945
What's the worst thing that could happen?

84
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:06,468
I know you think you're trying to help. Don't.

85
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:11,062
You gotta promise me you won't go out.
You have to lay low.

86
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:14,263
Trust me. I'm lookin' out for you.

87
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:19,752
OK.

88
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:24,342
Lay low.

89
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:29,268
Read Father's books. <i>Little Women.</i>

90
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,026
Good.

91
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,542
I got you some of those snack cakes you like.

92
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:56,710
I've been thinkin' about
a nice hot bath all day.

93
00:07:56,793 --> 00:08:01,389
I've been thinkin' about Joshua all alone
while the rest of the world is having a party.

94
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:04,431
What am I supposed to do?
Let him tag along with me?

95
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:07,710
"Hey, gang. Say hi to Joshua,
my transgenic mutant friend."

96
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:10,068
Everyone's gonna think it's a costume.

97
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:14,704
He's better off where he is. No one can ask
him any questions or make any judgments.

98
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,353
Judgements about who? Him or you?

99
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:27,229
Look, all I wanna be is a nice normal girl,
and have a nice normal Halloween.

100
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,153
Whatever normal means.

101
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,184
Wake up, boo.

102
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,468
I'm awake.

103
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,192
- Your boy's here.
- My boy?

104
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,662
Your date. Rafer.

105
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:15,788
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,666
- No costume?
- I don't really do Halloween. You?

107
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:24,588
I'm a genetically engineered killing machine
escaped from a government lab.

108
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:33,067
You don't read the tabloids?

109
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,822
Weren't we supposed to meet at Crash?

110
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,985
Yeah. This is kind of embarrassing,

111
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:43,393
but would you mind
coming by my mom's place with me?

112
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:43,711
But would you mind
coming by my mom's place with me?

113
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,785
- Your mom?
- She really wants to meet you.

114
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,262
Is that a problem?

115
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,071
No. Not at all.

116
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,791
Rafer.

117
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,103
And this must be Max.

118
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:58,390
- Nice to meet you.
- He's told me so much about you.

119
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,590
I said I must meet this special girl.

120
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:06,383
- I'm not so special.
- Come. Let me tell your fortune.

121
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,464
I don't know...

122
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,706
I can really see the family resemblance.

123
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,985
Max is not your name.

124
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,592
You two have the same nose.

125
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:27,506
- Your name is...
- Guevara. Max Guevara.

126
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,028
No.

127
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:33,423
It says so right here on my sector pass.

128
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:36,550
You have no name, only a number.

129
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,029
I see secrets, dark secrets,

130
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:46,264
wrapped in mystery, shrouded in illusion.

131
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,821
You are not what you seem!

132
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:52,348
Guess you busted me on my push-up bra.

133
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,867
You are running from something.

134
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,342
Running from your past.

135
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:02,630
- I was gawky in high school.
- No matter where you run there is danger.

136
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,344
I see danger all around.

137
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,308
And then I see...

138
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,222
I see nothing.

139
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,068
Except a face!

140
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:22,384
Whose face? Is it a guy?

141
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,590
A girl, then. With blonde hair, right?

142
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:28,028
It is neither man nor woman.

143
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,022
It is the face of...

144
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,904
death!

145
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:43,546
Mom, are you OK?
Let's get you some water.

146
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,622
Great first impression.

147
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:01,703
I thought I told you to stay home.

148
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:04,182
Max and Joshua outside.

149
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,345
You just don't see fabric like this any more.

150
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:15,902
My mom's OK. Sometimes she gets
a little carried away, but she likes you.

151
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:19,952
- That's great.
- Rafer, my son!

152
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,864
Be right back.

153
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,942
- Max and Joshua gotta blaze.
- Go home.

154
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,344
Pretty wack.

155
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:31,666
If I go out there for one minute,
will you go away?

156
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,142
- Lay low till you say so.
- OK.

157
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:40,149
- How'd you find me?
- Original Cindy said "She's with hot boy."

158
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,623
What was so damn important
it couldn't wait?

159
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,750
- Sally.
- Sally? Sally who?

160
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:49,353
Sally.

161
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,025
Sally.

162
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,827
Is he dead?

163
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:59,223
Do I look like I'm dead?
Do I sound like I'm dead?

164
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,587
Criminy, I thought you said she was an X5.

165
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,867
X5.

166
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:06,944
What happened?

167
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,831
All you need to know, dollface,
is I had an accident.

168
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:14,907
Being a Manticore alum myself, I can't exactly
beat feet to the emergency room now, can I?

169
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,342
- You're a Nomlie.
- An anomaly?

170
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:21,551
Hell, no. I'm exactly what they wanted.
Designed with cartilage instead of bone.

171
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:26,661
Good news is I don't fracture in battle.
Bad news, I get bent out of shape sometimes.

172
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,904
I guess.

173
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:33,748
Well, don't just stand there gawking like
a couple of chuckleheads. Do something.

174
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:40,670
I'll immobilise his upper body while
you rotate his head back into position.

175
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:47,908
I'll move his shoulders this way.
You move his head the other way.

176
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,268
Put your back into it.
I haven't got all night.

177
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,025
On three.

178
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:54,991
One, two, three.

179
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,181
Now you've done it.

180
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:09,992
This can't be happening.

181
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:14,669
You never seen a soldier whose body parts
are self-sustaining and regenerative?

182
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,586
Starfish. Starfish in his cocktail.

183
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,506
I can take a direct mortar hit and shake it off.

184
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,750
Incoming!

185
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,263
What are you doing?
Get your ass back here!

186
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,787
What can I do? Body's got a mind of its own.

187
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,865
Rover doesn't have a prayer.
I run like the wind, baby.

188
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:41,747
- Body's gone. Very fast.
- Like I said.

189
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:46,384
We gotta do something fast. I don't need
a headless transgenic on the loose.

190
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:48,065
Max!

191
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:52,744
- Where'd you disappear to?
- Rafer...

192
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,825
- Say hi to my friend Joshua.
- Tricks and treats.

193
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:58,825
Cool costume.

194
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:02,701
Rafer, I was wondering,
can we borrow your car to run an errand?

195
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:06,225
- Sure. Yeah, I guess.
- Cool. Meet you out front.

196
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:13,910
We need reinforcements.
You need to call some people.

197
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,951
- Who?
- Couple of transgenic colleagues are in town.

198
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,025
- Sure that's a good idea?
- Just get me to a phone.

199
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,141
- We set to go?
- In a sec.

200
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,787
They just... I mean...

201
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:32,582
He just needed to make a phone call...
Joshua needed to make a phone call.

202
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:37,545
So, you're a paramedic.

203
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,624
Yeah, right.

204
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:43,911
Cool. You probably see some
really gruesome stuff out there, right?

205
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:47,463
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Torn-off limbs.

206
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,788
Guts hangin' out.

207
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:53,229
- Decapitations.
- Not a lot of those, thank God.

208
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:59,309
But you'd know what to do if someone's
head was off and needed to be put back on?

209
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,144
You could handle it?

210
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:06,385
Once someone's head comes off,
it pretty much stays off.

211
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,548
Right.

212
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:11,263
It's ringing.

213
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:14,311
OK, Lassie, you align the receiver to my ear

214
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:18,272
so I can communicate with the person
who's going to answer on the other end.

215
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,628
Other way, moron.

216
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,702
Hello?

217
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:24,703
- Hey, baby, it's me.
- Me, who?

218
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,784
Don't be like that. It's Sally.

219
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:31,185
You mean Sally who stood me up
for the third time straight last night?

220
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:34,982
- I'm not talking to him.
- Wait. I will make it up to you later, kitten.

221
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:38,543
Right now, I'm in a situation,
extreme in nature.

222
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,863
- Get my drift?
- Let me guess.

223
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:44,866
- The business part of you's run off again?
- Matter of fact, yes.

224
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,228
But I still got man skills, sugar.

225
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:53,026
Don't even try and get on my good side.

226
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,583
Fun and games aside,
I gotta get the rest of me back, pronto.

227
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:59,745
Hook me up with your lizard buddy.
We gotta strategise.

228
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,824
Hold on.

229
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,269
- Speak.
- Sally's on the line.

230
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:14,904
His body's gone AWOL again
and we're putting together a search party.

231
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,622
Sorry. Me and Chad
are going to a Halloween party.

232
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:21,147
Chad? Who the hell is Chad?

233
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,793
My life partner. And watch your language.

234
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:27,661
We've been out for three months
and you've already got a life partner?

235
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,142
You never know when love will find you.

236
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,547
Chad's worked on his costume.
I can't let him down.

237
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:37,069
Listen to me, frog boy.
I'm in a major situation and I need backup.

238
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:41,465
Tell your life partner you have other plans,
and get your slimy butt in gear.

239
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:43,942
- Capeesh?
- Gotta blaze.

240
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,711
- So where are we going?
- To meet some friends.

241
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:53,512
Am I going the right way here?

242
00:17:56,073 --> 00:18:00,032
Good thing I'm without my stomach.
I'd be losing it right about now.

243
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,183
Quiet!

244
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:06,061
Quiet. The ambulance sure is quiet
without the sirens going.

245
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:11,709
So, Joshua, you're what?
A Wookiee? A <i>Planet of the Apes</i> guy?

246
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,785
- Special. First.
- First what?

247
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:24,032
First prize. He won first prize
for his costume at school.

248
00:18:24,113 --> 00:18:27,992
He's an exchange student.
You know, English as a second language.

249
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,149
- Way to go. Where you from?
- Father.

250
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,021
- Father... land.
- I always wanted to visit Germany.

251
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,742
This is gonna be a long night.

252
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:43,665
- So what kinda errand are we running?
- Looking everywhere.

253
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:47,632
It's like a tradition in Germany
this time of year to look for stuff.

254
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:50,705
- Like a scavenger hunt?
- Exactly.

255
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:53,785
- Kinda like an Oktoberfest thing.
- Exactly.

256
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,467
- I'm down with that.
- Fest thing.

257
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,344
- Stop.
- Where?

258
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,232
Here.

259
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:13,431
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. My foot fell asleep. I'll be right in.

260
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:14,912
All right.

261
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,664
I'm suffocating under here.

262
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:25,506
While we're in there, not one peep outta you.

263
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:27,872
Easy.

264
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:30,069
Come on.

265
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,545
Are you guys from Germany too?

266
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:44,911
Yeah. This is Dieter and Katarina.

267
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,348
Call me Kat.

268
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,824
I thought his costume was great,
but you guys are tight.

269
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,344
What are you?
A desert-acclimated combat soldier?

270
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,993
- Wide receiver.
- Reinforcement.

271
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:02,544
He means they're part of
our scavenger-hunt team. Right?

272
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:04,746
- Right.
- Right.

273
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,307
Easy on the caffeine.

274
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:16,542
- Tonight's special is haggis.
- Haggis? What's haggis?

275
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,906
Heart, liver, lung of a sheep,
minced with suet, onions and oatmeal,

276
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:24,588
boiled in the animal's stomach.
Comes with fries or coleslaw.

277
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,466
Haggis.

278
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,507
- I'll have the haggis.
- I'll have the haggis.

279
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:36,503
- Just water.
- Nothing for me, thanks.

280
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:39,630
Haggis, haggis, haggis,
one water, one nothing.

281
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:44,547
The sandbox is over there.

282
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:54,353
Here's the deal. Under no circumstances can
that guy know he's rolling with transgenics.

283
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,266
Mess up and your mutant asses
will be kicked.

284
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:58,862
Yeah.

285
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,424
Any idea where your body might be?

286
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,583
- Not a clue.
- Think.

287
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:13,147
Excuse me for being
a little light-headed, no thanks to you.

288
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,622
- I think I'm supposed to meet somebody.
- Who?

289
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:20,468
A female. Redhead.
Great set of hooters, nice round bubble butt.

290
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,070
- Me and this hottie were meant to hook up.
- Where?

291
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:27,862
Can't remember. No, wait.
First I'm supposed to get something.

292
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,944
What?

293
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:33,230
Package. I was waiting for
a delivery but it never showed.

294
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:38,387
The messenger service closed early,
so I was gonna go get it myself after hours.

295
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,622
Where?

296
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:43,228
- Some place in Sector Nine.
- Can you be a little more specific?

297
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,781
I can't remember the name.

298
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:48,751
Jam Clydesdale? Flam Pony?

299
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,142
- Jam Pony?
- Yeah, that's the one.

300
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,110
Oh, my God.

301
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:58,905
- We gotta blaze.
- Blaze now? Before haggis?

302
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:06,587
Max, looks like you're hangin' out
with a higher class of people than usual.

303
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:12,783
- Reagan Ronald's the name.
- Call me Kat.

304
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:15,864
I'm charmed.

305
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:21,029
- Cool costume.
- It's not a costume. It's for haggis night.

306
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:23,502
The <i>spécialité de maison.</i>

307
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,224
I'm sorry. Allergic to cats.

308
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:35,343
Not that you're really a cat, but just goes
to show you the power of the human mind.

309
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,424
I see a cat, I sneeze.

310
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,509
I can't breathe in here.

311
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,982
- What was that?
- Dieter can throw his voice.

312
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:49,826
He's a scream at parties.

313
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:54,991
- Can you make that salt shaker talk too?
- What a moron.

314
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,712
Better keep practising.

315
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,512
- We're outta here.
- I thought people wanted haggis.

316
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:03,312
They ran out. See ya.

317
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,987
Great to meet you.

318
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:16,393
- Be right back.
- What are you hunting for here?

319
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:16,791
- Be right back.
- What are you hunting for here?

320
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,228
- Ming vase.
- Saxophone.

321
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:24,151
You know, one of those
14th-century royal Chinese saxophones?

322
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,468
Don't you wanna go with 'em?

323
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,707
You remind me of my friend Chad.

324
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:40,146
- How big's your package?
- Let's just say I don't get any complaints.

325
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,748
How'd you like me to pluck out your eyes?
Tell me what I'm looking for.

326
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,903
A package. That's all I know.

327
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,182
Everybody take a pile.

328
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,943
- This way, everyone.
- It's Reagan Ronald.

329
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,631
Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go!

330
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:16,665
OK, gather round.
Clear the way.

331
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:20,109
I'm pleased to announce
our greatest fears have been realised.

332
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,832
Mutant transgenic monsters live among us.

333
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:27,429
I surreptitiously photographed these fiends
earlier on this evening.

334
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:32,223
Unfortunately, my undercover activities
force me to relinquish my post here.

335
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:36,386
While I was out, a headless mutant
broke in and stole a package.

336
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:39,271
Surveillance video caught the entire thing.

337
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:45,069
Is there a cat in here?
Did someone bring a cat in here?

338
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:57,429
The package that this headless mutant
absconded with, do we know what was in it?

339
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,949
No, we do not. However,
in this vermin's haste to flee,

340
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:06,630
he dropped a piece of paper which reads:
"Be at the coordinates at 10pm."

341
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:10,713
I hate cats. Vile creatures.

342
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:12,465
I hate cats. Vile creatures.

343
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,944
They're always sleepin'
and lickin' themselves.

344
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:21,506
Lovely.

345
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:27,112
As for this headless mutant,
he will not succeed in his nefarious mission.

346
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,788
While I coordinate operations here at HQ,

347
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:35,424
you will scour the night, you will find him,
and beat him into a transgenic paste.

348
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:40,951
But first, cake and ice cream upstairs. Yeah?
An army marches on its stomach.

349
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:52,266
- What a loon.
- What does that mean, meet at 10pm?

350
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:55,470
Got me. I told you, I was planning
on hookin' up with that redhead.

351
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,704
Where? Talk fast or the left eye goes first.

352
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:03,264
Some bar. Munch? Crunch? Smash? Rash?

353
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,662
- Crash?
- That's the one.

354
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:07,744
This just gets better and better.

355
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:22,591
What are you looking for here? Waffle iron,
ukulele, stuffed moose head, whatever.

356
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:27,747
It's not even like that. We're playing by
German rules. Can you get me a beer?

357
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,222
Yeah. One brewski coming up.

358
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:43,548
Look at my girl, comin' correct
and takin' Joshua for a night on the town.

359
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,227
That is so not what's happening.

360
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,867
Hey, brown sugar, what's cookin'?

361
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:53,229
Sweet baby Jesus! Tell me
I did not see what I just saw.

362
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:00,707
Hold this. I'll be right back.

363
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,462
Thought you were trackin' down a hit man.

364
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:13,828
Excuse me?

365
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:17,701
Sorry. Have you two
seen a headless body around?

366
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:20,508
Back room.

367
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:40,392
Max, just been discussing
the mutant infestation with your boy here.

368
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:42,862
Not right now, Sketch!

369
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:57,870
- Alpha leader. Come in, alpha leader.
- Roger. This is alpha leader. Over.

370
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:00,626
This isn't Roger. This is Sketchy.

371
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:04,342
"Roger" is an acknowledgment
in the affirmative, not a name, moron.

372
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,901
How many times have I told you?
Say "over". Over.

373
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:10,349
- Acknowledged. Over over.
- No, not "over over".

374
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,665
- "Over." Over.
- That's what I just said. Over over.

375
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:18,143
Oh, God. Never mind.
What have you got for me? Over.

376
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:21,782
The headless mutant transgenic
male Caucasian subject just left,

377
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,989
armed with a sniper rifle.

378
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:26,303
The others went after him. Over over.

379
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:29,988
Roger. Guess we know
what was in that package he was after.

380
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,388
All right, this is alpha leader. Clear.

381
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:36,067
You forgot to say "over over". Over over.

382
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,386
Nitwit.

383
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:45,861
- Why are we chasing this guy?
- That rifle he's got, we need it to win.

384
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:49,832
- Other team.
- Isn't that weird for a scavenger hunt?

385
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:52,302
German rules. Step on it!

386
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:58,903
What?

387
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:01,109
We're outta gas.

388
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:06,347
Great. Just great.

389
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,344
Thanks, guys.

390
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:25,302
OK, talk. Why's your body packin' heat?

391
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:28,112
Seattle's a rough town.
Maybe I wanted protection.

392
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:30,548
A rifle as protection? Try again.

393
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:34,705
You'll never get it out of me.

394
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:39,950
Fine. Fine.

395
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:42,069
- I'm in town on a mission.
- A mission?

396
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,713
For Manticore.

397
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:47,387
Manticore's gone. Finito. Kaput.

398
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,782
No more missions?

399
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,751
- For any of us?
- Your mission from now on is to lay low,

400
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,224
which is why we can't have this idiot
running around waving an assault rifle.

401
00:29:57,313 --> 00:30:01,909
Manticore or no, I take pride in my work.
And Mr Lemkin expects the job to be done.

402
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:04,826
Lemkin? Pierpont Lemkin?

403
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:08,632
I can't believe I just said that.

404
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:10,783
You're the hit man Logan talked about.

405
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:15,546
Lemkin. Lemkin. Lumps in my Lemkin!

406
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,624
Give me that.

407
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:22,189
How can your body work
without the rest of it tagging along?

408
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,787
Muscle memory.
I trained for months for this job.

409
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:28,627
- Who's the target?
- No way. I've said too much already.

410
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:33,065
- Now you listen to me...
- OK, we're good to go.

411
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:41,822
- Change of plan. We're going to Logan's.
- Your ex-boyfriend's house?

412
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:46,031
He's not my ex-boyfriend.
I mean, we're not like that.

413
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,341
- <i>My Girl.</i>
- <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

414
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,424
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

415
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,824
<i>Little Women.</i>

416
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,624
I read that.

417
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:05,904
Beth dies.

418
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:13,551
- So I'm thinkin' my head is your hit man.
- Could be.

419
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,908
We still need to figure out who the victim is.

420
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,188
- Good luck.
- Zip it!

421
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:21,513
- <i>Tokyo Decadence.</i>
- <i>Idle Hands.</i>

422
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,343
- <i>Tokyo Decadence.</i>
- <i>Idle Hands.</i>

423
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,469
- <i>Born Free.</i>
- No.

424
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,262
<i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill, Kill, Kill!</i>

425
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:32,303
- Look at me. Look at Joshua!
- <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</i>

426
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,224
- Bingo.
- Found something?

427
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:36,349
No, I got bingo.

428
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:39,982
How is this going to help us find the target?

429
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,472
Yeah.

430
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,703
Good work. Thanks.

431
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:53,227
My informant. According to him, the target
is either a priest, a minister or a rabbi.

432
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:58,546
- I feel like I've heard this joke before.
- It's not a joke. A man's life is at stake.

433
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:04,469
Father McAllister, Reverend Beckwith and
Rabbi Stutz are outspoken religious leaders.

434
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:07,590
Any of them could've tangled
with Lemkin and bought this hit.

435
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:12,224
- You can't narrow it down any more?
- Not unless that head starts talkin'.

436
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:20,464
Let me break it down for you, Sally. Tell me
what you know, or you're in a world of hurt.

437
00:32:20,553 --> 00:32:24,341
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Yeah? You ever had a swirlie?

438
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,223
You ready to talk, Sally?

439
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:48,351
Max, what are you doing?

440
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:52,269
All right, all right!

441
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:55,550
I'll tell ya. It's the priest - Father McAllister.

442
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,748
That's a...

443
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,951
Battery-operated, voice-activated
animatronic head. Realistic, isn't it?

444
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,022
Yeah.

445
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:09,470
There's a perfectly simple
explanation for this.

446
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,384
Boo!

447
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,862
I've had enough of you.

448
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,302
Head... talking.

449
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:25,343
- No body.
- It's OK, man.

450
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,424
We're all friends here.

451
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:35,786
Wait a minute. You're not really German
exchange students on a scavenger hunt.

452
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,987
You're monsters.

453
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:44,701
Rafer, I had a real nice time. Call me.

454
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:50,230
OK, team, we're moving out.
Can you keep Rafer entertained?

455
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:53,510
- No problem.
- Let's go. Come on, kitty.

456
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:16,507
Logan says Father McAllister's receiving
a humanitarian award on Sunday night.

457
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,902
- Father?
- Different Father. Stay with me.

458
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:23,464
Tonight there's a run-through. Not much
security. Perfect opportunity for a hit.

459
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:27,944
We need to search the place top to bottom.
Joshua, you take the basement.

460
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,945
Joshua in basement. Always the plan.

461
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:36,391
Fine, take the roof. You take the basement.
You handle backstage. I'll do the catwalks.

462
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:39,670
I think I might be better suited
to handle the catwalks.

463
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,506
How about you do what I say
and we don't have a problem?

464
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,982
- Catfight.
- Let's get moving.

465
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:55,225
We walk over to the podium
where I am to accept my award.

466
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:57,383
Well-deserved, I might add.

467
00:35:57,473 --> 00:36:01,261
I wait till the applause dies down,
then I give my acceptance speech.

468
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:05,471
And I promise you, there won't be
a dry eye in the house.

469
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:08,541
Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for?

470
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:16,948
- Father McAllister, over here.
- Who's that calling my name?

471
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:23,030
A great admirer of yours.
How about an autograph, Your Eminence?

472
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,584
Let me go!

473
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,862
Just kick her ass.

474
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:58,026
So this was some kind of
drunken Halloween fraternity prank?

475
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:00,149
Apparently so, Your Worship.

476
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:04,704
That hooligan was intending to egg you
as part of a pagan initiation ritual.

477
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:08,832
Thank you, my children,
for putting a stop to his heathen plan.

478
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:12,428
- Don't thank her, Your Godliness.
- Thank us. We saved you.

479
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,504
Now just hold the phone.

480
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,509
- I'm Eyes Only.
- I'm supreme commandant of S1W.

481
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:20,390
Saints preserve us.

482
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:23,704
When you have a moment,
Your Cleanliness, would you marry us?

483
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:26,705
It would be my privilege, my son.

484
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,433
There they are, constables! Do your duty!

485
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,502
There they are, constables! Do your duty!

486
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:34,586
Pardon the interruption, Your Significance,
but these people are monsters.

487
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:36,868
Max, get away.

488
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:40,271
- Max...
- No, he wasn't hurting anybody.

489
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:43,345
And what do you know about it?
Are you one of them?

490
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,183
Well, answer him, Max.

491
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,866
No, I'm not one of them.

492
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,148
Then move along
and mind your own business.

493
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:07,951
Max...

494
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:18,502
All I wanted was a normal night out.

495
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:24,981
But I guess, for a girl like me,
normal is just too much to ask.

496
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,946
The thing is...

497
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,432
Boo!

498
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:33,503
- What are you doin' here?
- Checkin' in on you.

499
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,107
Poor Joshua's gonna spend his life in a cage.

500
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:41,503
- I know. It's all my fault.
- Got that right.

501
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:46,062
Max and Joshua,
outside with up-here people.

502
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:49,111
- Wanna end up in a cage?
- What's the worst that could happen?

503
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,782
- What the hell was that?
- Flashback. Happens all the time.

504
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,103
Thought I was trippin' there.

505
00:38:56,193 --> 00:38:59,390
This whole evening's
been one great big nightmare.

506
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:03,749
But the worst part wasn't
some talking head in a bag,

507
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:08,827
or Nomlies eatin' haggis, or even
Joshua gettin' hauled off by the po-po's.

508
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:12,387
It was my girl denying who she really is.

509
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:15,223
Denying the people that she loves.

510
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:20,272
Sugar, that's the worst thing
that you ever coulda done.

511
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:23,265
That's the worst thing
that coulda happened.

512
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,826
But can I ask you one question?

513
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,302
Where are your clothes?

514
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:39,071
Boo.

515
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:40,552
Hey!

516
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,506
What are you gonna be
for Halloween? A prune?

517
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:49,833
I just had the weirdest dream.

518
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:53,303
Put some clothes on.
You're gonna be late for the party at Crash.

519
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,385
And your boy Rafer is waitin' on your ass.

520
00:39:57,753 --> 00:40:01,905
Tell him I couldn't make it.
There's something I gotta do.

521
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:08,143
Hey, big fella.

522
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:10,224
What ya doin'?

523
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,864
Lay low.

524
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,944
I've been thinkin'.

525
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:20,665
You and me aren't like other people. We're
different, and nothing's gonna change that.

526
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:23,551
Joshua and Max, different.

527
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:26,864
Yeah. Some people might even call us freaks.

528
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:29,511
Freaks.

529
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:34,111
Which is why we gotta stick together.

530
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,827
So I'm gonna take you out.

531
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:42,993
Even if it's just for one night.

532
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:46,304
Come on.

533
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:51,626
- Tricks and treats?
- What's the worst that could happen?

534
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,224
Cool costume.

535
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,346

1
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:18,531
- How long will Prescott detain me?
- Until after the press conference.

2
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:23,892
In two hours he'll announce our response
to the bomb and his ascension to president.

3
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:27,522
I've done with Bauer.
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.

4
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,446
We're onto other things.
You've been reassigned.

5
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,125
You can't reassign me now.

6
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:37,333
You have made yourself
a liability I can't afford.

7
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,165
This is Kim Bauer. I need my dad.

8
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:42,051
- What's wrong?
- I'm at the Mathesons' house.

9
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:45,489
Gary's here. He has a gun. He killed
the policeman that brought me.

10
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:50,601
I want you to point the gun at his chest
and pull the trigger now.

11
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:52,570
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:57,727
I'll send someone to pick you up.
Go downstairs and wait for them.

13
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,611
I am certain the Cyprus audio has
been forged.

14
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,049
I have in custody the man who engineered it.
I'll bring him in soon.

15
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,364
- How will it work?
- I'll make a recording for them, on the spot.

16
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,525
Shift it around, reframe segments,
same specs as Cyprus.

17
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,127
- Where are you going?
- This is taking too long.

18
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:18,082
We're the only ones who can help you.
Without us, you don't stand a chance.

19
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,084
Alex!

20
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,124
Alex!

21
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,844
Thank you.

22
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:41,563
- How's Chappelle?
- Still unconscious, but he's starting to stir.

23
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,645
The drug I gave him is short-acting.
He may need more.

24
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,167
How long can you keep pumping him full?

25
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:52,247
Long enough for Jack to deliver Hewitt.
How are we coming on the chopper?

26
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:56,690
It should land at Hewitt's in ten minutes.
We should have him here in half an hour.

27
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,492
- Is Carrie asking about Chappelle?
- Not yet, no.

28
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:02,610
Image processing should
keep her busy for a while.

29
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:04,649
Excuse me, Mr Almeida?

30
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,612
Brad Hammond from Division wants
Mr Chappelle. Do you know where he is?

31
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:13,289
No, I'll take it. This is Tony Almeida.
How can I help you, sir?

32
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,604
- Where's Ryan?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

33
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:19,332
His office says he arrived
at CTU three hours ago.

34
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:22,644
- None of your people can find him.
- He must have stepped out.

35
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,691
He didn't log out.
Did he say where he was going?

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,209
Not to me, sir, but I'll
let you know as soon as I find him.

37
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:32,046
No, you'll tell me what's going on over there.

38
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:35,284
I know Ryan Chappelle was
going to assess the situation.

39
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:39,207
I cannot think why he would be
out of contact during a national crisis.

40
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,683
Mr Hammond, I'm sorry,
I've told you all that I know, sir.

41
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,082
I'll make sure Ryan calls when he returns.

42
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,528
- You do that.
- Thank you, sir.

43
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:54,329
- What's goin' on?
- Division knows something's up.

44
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:59,612
- So what are we gonna do?
- Get Alex Hewitt here as quickly as possible.

45
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:03,684
Alex!

46
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:13,764
Alex!

47
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:23,326
Alex, if you don't come with me,
Kingsley will kill you. You know that!

48
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:31,492
I just did what they told me.
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

49
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:39,611
Your only way outta this
is to let me take you into CTU.

50
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,003
You can cut a deal, testify!

51
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:48,212
Alex, you're gonna have to trust me!

52
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:52,201
Alex!

53
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,928
Alex! Stop running!

54
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,571
Alex!

55
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,244
Alex, listen to me.

56
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,848
A chopper's on its way to take us to CTU,
where no one can hurt you.

57
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:34,166
Please, Alex. Help me stop this war
and I will help you stay alive, I promise.

58
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,050
Please.

59
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,970
Alex!

60
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,283
Stop, damn it!

61
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:14,571
I know the oil stocks closed high in
Hong Kong last night, Max, but remember,

62
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:19,204
once the president announces the war,
the margins will change dramatically.

63
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:23,730
- Prices will spike immediately.
- It's still worth acquiring shares.

64
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,646
- Do we still have our problem?
- That'll be taken care of.

65
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,406
- This must go smoothly.
- Don't worry about it.

66
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:32,087
- I have to go.
- OK.

67
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:37,772
- What'd you get?
- All the recordings and data.

68
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:39,844
But no Hewitt?

69
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:43,965
We got there as soon as we could,
but I had no lead time.

70
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,171
Everything, including Hewitt, was
meant to have been vaporised last night.

71
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:52,804
I won't let some pimply-faced techie
ruin everything that we've planned.

72
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:58,843
If he gets brought in and testifies, there's
gonna be no place for any of us to hide.

73
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,002
Alex!

74
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:54,444
Alex! There's nowhere left to run. It's over.

75
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,690
All right. You... you promise I'll be safe?

76
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,048
I give you my word.

77
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:11,125
Alex, drop the gun! Drop the gun!

78
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:15,445
If you try to shoot me, I will have
to shoot you back, and I won't miss.

79
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,331
And I don't wanna do that.

80
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:23,412
I can't stop this war without you, Alex.
Please, drop the gun.

81
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,166
Please, drop the gun.

82
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:29,325
Alex, you're a smart guy. Think this through.

83
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:32,291
I am the only guy that
can get you through this alive.

84
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,329
Please, drop the gun.

85
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,727
Drop the gun.

86
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:45,891
- Alex...
- You shot me!

87
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,612
- You shot me!
- It's gonna be all right.

88
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,012
No!

89
00:07:56,453 --> 00:08:00,082
Alex, Alex... Can you hear me?

90
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:04,325
OK, stay calm. Don't move.
You're gonna be all right.

91
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:07,644
- What happened?
- You fell.

92
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:15,566
Alex, stay with me.
I want you to keep your eyes open, OK?

93
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,451
Just keep your eyes open. OK...

94
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,327
- Agh!
- You're OK.

95
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,803
The bullet didn't hit an artery.
The chopper should be here soon.

96
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,361
- You're not gonna bleed to death.
- It hurts.

97
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:34,323
I'm gonna get you something for the pain
as soon as we get on the chopper.

98
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:41,250
Is there any other part of your body
besides your leg that still hurts?

99
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,291
No, not really.

100
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:49,447
OK, good. It looks like you got lucky.
You're gonna be fine.

101
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,047
My head... feels wet.

102
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,772
Just relax. Try and relax.

103
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:07,324
Just put your head down.

104
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:10,885
OK.

105
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:32,848
I gotta make a phone call, OK?
I'm not goin' anywhere. Stay with me.

106
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,524
Come on.

107
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,287
- Almeida.
- It's Jack. Hewitt's been hurt.

108
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:47,012
I need medical assistance on the roof now.

109
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:50,642
There's no EMT on the chopper,
but there's a med kit. Can you handle it?

110
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,725
I don't know. I hope so.
Look, I gotta get back to this.

111
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:55,292
- Wait.
- What?

112
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,251
You may not be able to contact me after this.

113
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,131
- Why?
- Chappelle became a problem.

114
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,647
I had to take him out of play,
and they're onto me.

115
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:07,692
- They'll take me out soon.
- Who do I contact if I need help?

116
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:12,449
Michelle is setting up an off-site station.
She'll do what she can by remote access.

117
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:16,572
She'll be on her closed cell,
channel B, node 12-12.

118
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,769
- B, node 12-12. I got it.
- Good luck.

119
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,003
Thanks.

120
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:23,891
Alex, how you doin'?

121
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,606
This'll get you into the van.

122
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,686
- How will I breakthrough the firewall?
- This has a range of a few blocks.

123
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:45,530
It's Huffman encoded. It'll get you in.
Give me a call when you're set, all right?

124
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,567
- Michelle.
- Hi.

125
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,009
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to my car.

126
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,526
- Are you leaving?
- No.

127
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:01,047
I'm just getting something.
Is there a problem?

128
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,330
- Have you seen Chappelle?
- No.

129
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,405
I've looked everywhere and I can't find him.

130
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:11,566
If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him.

131
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,131
And if you don't see him?

132
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:19,205
What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,410
My job is to monitor
communications around here.

134
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:26,771
- You don't think I know what's goin' on?
- Why don’t you tell me, Carrie?

135
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,289
You called Chappelle in to see Rudin.
I just talked to Rudin.

136
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:34,491
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- Well, of course he told you that.

137
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:38,248
His system wasn't loaded properly
and it was your fault.

138
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,123
He wanted to see Chappelle
to complain about you.

139
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:47,809
Stay out of my business, Carrie.
You'll do a better job.

140
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,802
Brian. How did you find out about me?

141
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,885
The Attorney General said
you'd want me for your counsel.

142
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:08,170
- What have they told you?
- You'd been removed from office

143
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,289
under the 25th Amendment.

144
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:14,002
- Is what they did legal?
- Technically, yes.

145
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,051
The cabinet can declare
the president incompetent

146
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:20,250
without further definition or clarification.

147
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:25,248
- That also gives me the right to appeal.
- Yes, which I will do vigorously.

148
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,723
- Unfortunately, it's a lengthy process.
- We don't have time.

149
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:33,762
- I don't know how to make it go any faster.
- None of those legalities matter.

150
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,448
We're about to go to war based on
evidence that I am convinced is false.

151
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:40,286
No one outside this room believes that.

152
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,490
The evidence was manipulated
by a man named Peter Kingsley.

153
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:46,087
I need you to find out all you can about him.

154
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,641
Mike Novick's tying my hands.

155
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,009
Get him to untie them -
whatever you have to do.

156
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,890
Yes, sir.

157
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,128
- Almeida.
- I'm in place.

158
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,568
- Where are you?
- I'm in the north lot.

159
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:04,770
Van 15a. Listen, Tony, Carrie's onto us.

160
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,845
- She was asking about Chappelle.
- What did you tell her?

161
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:11,050
That I didn't know anything,
but we need her out of the way.

162
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,682
- Keep her occupied.
- OK, I'll handle it. Get ahold of Jack.

163
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,809
I gotta go. Hammond's here.

164
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,125
- Mr Hammond.
- Tony.

165
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:23,932
- What are you doing here?
- I told you on the phone.

166
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:28,723
I think there’s a problem here.
Where's Ryan Chappelle?

167
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:32,408
- I haven't seen him yet, sir.
- I see.

168
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,848
Two of you take this side.

169
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,208
I want this section covered.

170
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,853
- What are you doin'?
- I'm locking you down.

171
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:44,051
We're in the middle of preparing
a domestic response to this war.

172
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:49,651
That's not what I heard. I heard you were
supporting a rogue agent against orders.

173
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,122
- Where'd you hear that?
- One of your people.

174
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,523
Let's go. Cover every square inch of the place!

175
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,723
- I'm aware of that.
- That flyover space is critical.

176
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,849
- Will David help us?
- I don't know.

177
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,571
Mike.

178
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,212
I don't see us having much success with him.

179
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:22,889
- We need this, Mike.
- Yes, sir, I'll try. How is he?

180
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:26,761
David is convinced his decision
to hold off on the bombers was correct.

181
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,969
He'll appeal his removal from office.

182
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:33,444
- The 25th Amendment gives him that right.
- We'll prove we're being manipulated

183
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:39,449
and that the Cyprus recording was falsified,
plus we now think we know by whom.

184
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,128
- I'm listening.
- A man named Peter Kingsley.

185
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,205
He's got ties to oil interests
both here and abroad.

186
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:50,286
Have you found anything to connect him
to the Cyprus recording, or the bomb?

187
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:54,571
No. We won't be able to without
access to the Intelligence database.

188
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:58,328
David's locked down until we've
gone public with the military action.

189
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,563
- By then it'll be too late.
- I'm sorry.

190
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,803
Mike, wait. Just hold on a second.

191
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:08,206
I remember when you signed up for David's
first run at the Senate over 20 years ago.

192
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:13,492
That's... that's a lot of history
to just throw out the window.

193
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,053
Come on, Mike.

194
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:23,207
I know you just did what you thought
was right, but let him try to prove his case.

195
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,887
You owe him that.

196
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:36,888
I'll have Colleen set up
a computer station for you.

197
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:40,249
You won't be able to transmit
outgoing messages.

198
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,801
That's fair enough.

199
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:50,442
- What's in here?
- A holding room. No one's in there now.

200
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,524
All right.

201
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:06,331
- And this?
- The other holding room.

202
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,805
It shouldn't be locked.

203
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:17,042
- What's wrong?
- Someone must have reconfigured the lock.

204
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:36,326
Come on, Alex. Keep talking to me.

205
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,769
Everything's... a little blurry.

206
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,606
What's happening to me?

207
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,732
Nothing. You just banged your head.
It's gonna be all right, OK?

208
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:52,091
You just hang in there.

209
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:56,647
Alex, I can hear 'em. They're coming, OK?

210
00:16:56,733 --> 00:17:00,487
Help's on the way. Just hang in there, OK?

211
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:13,491
I've located the CTU chopper
that Tony Almeida sent to Jack Bauer.

212
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:16,326
They're landing.
Would you like them to detain Bauer?

213
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:20,008
No, I don't wanna waste
any more resources on him.

214
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:23,085
Just get the chopper back here.

215
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,368
Mr Chappelle wants you to come back now.

216
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:27,250
- We're about to land.
- I know.

217
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,403
- I can see him...
- Just do it.

218
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,442
What are you waiting for?

219
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,889
- I'm putting her down.
- No, cancel that.

220
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:46,806
Land the chopper now!

221
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:51,284
What are you doing?!
Land the damn chopper!

222
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,850
My witness is gonna die! Land!

223
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:06,286
Your orders are to pick us up! Pick us up now!

224
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,572
Damn it!

225
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,603
- Dessler.
- The chopper won't pick us up.

226
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,730
- Hammond's locked us down.
- I don't give a damn!

227
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:24,328
Get me that chopper back! Hewitt is dying!

228
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,925
Alex.

229
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:56,090
- Want me to deal with Almeida?
- No, Brad, thanks. I'll take care of him myself.

230
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:00,610
- Michelle, it's me.
- Jack, where are you?

231
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:04,925
Going back to Hewitt's loft. Set up and
be ready to interface with his computer.

232
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:09,325
- What about Hewitt?
- He didn't make it. He's dead.

233
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,926
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:13,811
Call me when you're ready.

235
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,452
- Yes?
- I need to speak with you.

236
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,524
It concerns national security.

237
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:29,492
As I am not the commander in chief
any more, that's irrelevant.

238
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:32,041
We have a problem with
the Turkish government.

239
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,806
Our Stealth bombers are
nearing their airspace,

240
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,568
but one of their fighter patrols
spotted them a few minutes ago.

241
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:41,565
Ask the prime minister for the flyover.
He should agree.

242
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,042
The secretary of state has spoken to him.

243
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,012
- He'll grant us this under one condition.
- What's the condition?

244
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:53,690
He wants a personal request
and assurances from the president.

245
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,970
The prime minister doesn't know
I've been removed from office.

246
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:59,521
He couldn't be told
before the American people.

247
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:02,889
That wouldn't be right, would it, Mike?

248
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,328
Now that the bombers have been spotted,

249
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,928
it's critical that they get
to their targets quickly.

250
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:13,291
Any detour will take them
over unfriendly skies.

251
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:19,608
You want me to speak to the prime minister,
under the pretence that I'm still the president?

252
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:21,729
Yes.

253
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:25,123
This mission is going to
continue regardless, sir.

254
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:27,443
This phone call, no matter how distasteful,

255
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:31,003
could prevent those planes
from being attacked.

256
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,891
We only have minutes, sir.

257
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,890
Why did you leave me like this?
I've been stabbed!

258
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:51,851
Let me look at it.

259
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,924
Be careful.

260
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,282
You're lucky. The wound's superficial.

261
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:02,208
The bleeding's already stopped.
I'll get you a clean bandage for it.

262
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:06,286
- Where's Alex?
- He fell. He's dead.

263
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,331
Oh, my God. What happens now?

264
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,127
You are going to help me.

265
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,522
Just put this right here.

266
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:18,844
- Help you do what?
- We got one last play.

267
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:21,925
- To deliver Kingsley.
- No.

268
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:26,052
He's far too dangerous,
and you'll never get close to him.

269
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:29,205
You're right. I won't, but you will.

270
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,932
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.

271
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,483
If you say you can deliver him,
that should get his attention.

272
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:38,804
Kingsley has evidence that will
implicate me. There is no way...

273
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,690
Mrs Palmer, you...

274
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,684
What?

275
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,643
It's nothing. I'm fine.

276
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:53,408
Don't tell me it's nothing. What's going on?

277
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:01,088
My heart stopped when
Kingsley's men were interrogating me.

278
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:05,166
Your heart could be damaged.
You need to get to a doctor.

279
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:08,165
We need to get Kingsley first.

280
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:11,165
Mrs Palmer, you are going to help me.

281
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:14,723
I'm not gonna give you another choice.

282
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,646
You wouldn't dare hurt me.

283
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:21,931
Make no mistake about it.
I will do what I have to do.

284
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:27,684
What do you want me to do?

285
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:31,925
Tell Kingsley you'll exchange Hewitt
for any evidence that incriminates you.

286
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:35,608
He'll want proof that I have Hewitt.

287
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:38,924
- He'll get it.
- How?

288
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,447
Hewitt's gonna talk to him.

289
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:47,722
At this point, we can assume the chip
containing the source recordings

290
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,963
has not landed in government hands.

291
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:54,808
Did you intercept the federal agent
who was in possession of the chip?

292
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:58,044
No. But since the bombers are still on course,

293
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:01,603
we can assume that he wasn't
able to deliver it to the president.

294
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:06,892
Which leaves Hewitt as the last remaining
loose end. Where are we on finding him?

295
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:10,204
I have several teams out looking for him.

296
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:14,684
He cannot be allowed to talk.
Not now, nor ever.

297
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,607
Hewitt will be found, and he'll be eliminated.

298
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,888
Clean this up, Peter.

299
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:36,332
Go over it again, even if you
need to pull a couple of agents in to help you.

300
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:49,247
I don't need to tell you you're under arrest.

301
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,325
- Where's Michelle Dessler?
- She knew nothing about this.

302
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,688
She called me to the room
where you drugged me.

303
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:57,207
She didn't know what I was gonna do.

304
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:00,490
I need to issue a warrant.
Contact local police, issue a memo.

305
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,485
- I can find her.
- How?

306
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:09,925
This whole thing's been about helping Jack
Bauer. She's doing that somewhere off-site.

307
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,686
- How do we find her?
- Track her access code.

308
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,810
See if she's logged onto
the CTU computer network.

309
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,487
- Then do it.
- Right away.

310
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,891
Put him in Holding 2.

311
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:44,484
- Yeah?
- I'm connected to his computer.

312
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:47,610
Press "escape" and I can take control.

313
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:50,287
- Done.
- What did Hewitt tell you?

314
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:53,126
He had a program
that could recreate anybody's voice.

315
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:56,330
With a voice sample,
he could get it to say anything.

316
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,928
He kept all the audio files in a main file.

317
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,845
All right, I think I've found it.

318
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:11,089
I've never seen this.
Samples connect through an integrator.

319
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:16,088
- I need anything with Hewitt's voice on it.
- All right, hold on.

320
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:21,882
I'm gonna need Berkeley
and Wilkerson at that lunch.

321
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:24,567
- Is that him?
- No, damn it.

322
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,723
There's hundreds of files. Hold on.

323
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:29,532
Mrs Palmer, when did you call Hewitt?

324
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:34,368
- Last night, around midnight. Why?
- He might have recorded it.

325
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:37,968
Michelle, can you filter the audio files
by time and date?

326
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,613
Let me see... Yeah.

327
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:46,962
Find an audio file that was recorded late last
night or early this morning, around midnight.

328
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:51,445
This must be it.

329
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,883
- Hello?
- Alex Hewitt?

330
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:56,645
- Who's this?
- That's him.

331
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:59,884
- Sherry Palmer.
- We have to let it run.

332
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,009
What are you calling me for?

333
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,972
I know all about
your relationship with Peter Kingsley.

334
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:07,771
I don't know him.

335
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:11,732
I also know you had
all his phone conversations recorded.

336
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:17,490
Let me ask you. Was that to protect
yourself or to blackmail him?

337
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:20,724
It's OK, Alex.

338
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:23,850
- I'm here to help you.
- Who says I need help?

339
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:27,289
Peter thought you’d die in Los Angeles
with everybody else today.

340
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:31,685
Now that you haven't,
he's gonna come after you.

341
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:35,163
So listen to me, and I can protect you.

342
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,131
We have enough material
to create a phonetic template.

343
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,807
- Good. What do we do?
- Open up a.gen file

344
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,453
and type in the phrases we want voiced.

345
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,047
What do you mean, open a.gen file?

346
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:51,161
He created a separate module for playback.
We have to find what menu it's under.

347
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:54,450
- What am I looking for?
- It's not here.

348
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:57,570
Try a subroutine called Prologue.

349
00:26:57,653 --> 00:27:01,282
- It's this one.
- They've found me, Jack.

350
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:03,887
It's loading. What am I looking for now?

351
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:06,692
A playback graphic interface.
They're almost here.

352
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:11,369
- Come out of the van!
- Hold on, Michelle. Hold on.

353
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,405
- Ma'am, hands off the keyboard.
- I've got it. Michelle!

354
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:18,291
- Do we take her in?
- Michelle!

355
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:23,767
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody.

356
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,809
- Hello, Heather.
- Mr President.

357
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:57,365
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Heather.

358
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:13,087
- Mr President, we're ready.
- David.

359
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:15,528
I realise how awkward this is.

360
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:19,128
I hope Mike has told you
how much we appreciate your help.

361
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:25,163
Make no mistake. I believe
you're making a gross and tragic error.

362
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:29,246
I'm doing this for the men in those planes.

363
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,130
We're ready here. Patch in the prime minister.

364
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:44,166
- Mr Prime Minister.
- Hello, Mr President.

365
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,689
I've been trying to reach you for some time.

366
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:55,365
Kim?

367
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,125
Kim!

368
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,485
Hello?

369
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:24,287
Hello?

370
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:27,972
Kim?

371
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:39,845
Kim?

372
00:29:56,893 --> 00:30:00,124
- Who are you?
- I'm Kate Warner.

373
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:03,046
Your father sent me to come get you.

374
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,693
How do I know that?

375
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:07,729
OK.

376
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:13,046
You shot a man who came in here
to attack you. It was self-defence.

377
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:20,486
Your father, Jack Bauer, called me,
asked me to come get you, take you to CTU.

378
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:23,292
How else would I know all of that?

379
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,724
How do you know my dad?
Do you work at CTU?

380
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:32,567
No. My family was involved
with what happened today.

381
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:39,006
Why would my dad send someone
he'd just met to come get me? Huh?

382
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,124
He trusts me.

383
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,652
Come on, Kim.

384
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,928
It's OK.

385
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:03,570
The sooner we leave, the sooner
you and your dad can be together, OK?

386
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,485
What do you think they’ll charge us with?

387
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:43,526
They could push for treason if they wanted to.

388
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,331
Think they will?

389
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:49,804
Depends on how big of an example
they wanna make of us.

390
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,608
Look, Michelle...

391
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:58,481
no one can prove that you knew
what I was gonna do to Chappelle.

392
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:04,648
I'm gonna tell them that you were
helping Jack under my orders, all right?

393
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,682
No.

394
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,207
What do you mean, no?

395
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:15,286
I did what I thought was right.
I still believe that.

396
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:19,451
And I won't let you lie for me.

397
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,048
David...

398
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:04,449
Thank you. I know how difficult
it must have been for you.

399
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,481
How much longer will Prescott keep me here?

400
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:10,643
Until after the press conference.

401
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:16,569
I've requested you be released sooner,
but there's only so much I can do.

402
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:24,331
I spoke to Brian. He requested some
low-security access on your behalf.

403
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:27,450
I wanted you to know I granted it.

404
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:07,445
So what's going on with you and my dad?

405
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,524
Excuse me?

406
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:14,726
Out of everyone he could have called,
he called you.

407
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:17,611
There's gotta be a reason.

408
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:22,605
I don't think he trusts very many people.

409
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,724
He trusts you.

410
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:35,523
- Is it true you guys just met today?
- Yesterday really, but yeah, it is.

411
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:45,366
I don't resent it or anything.
I just... want him to be happy.

412
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:50,123
It's been a long time.

413
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:54,411
Since you lost your mother?

414
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,404
Yeah.

415
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:04,491
I lost my mother too.

416
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,731
When I was about your age.

417
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,964
I really don't think I can do this.

418
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:22,606
You'll do fine. Just tell him everything
I told you to say. Make the call.

419
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:29,084
Understood.

420
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:34,051
Still no sign of Hewitt.

421
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:42,365
Yes?

422
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:45,331
It's Sherry Palmer, Peter.

423
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:49,167
- Are we on a secure line?
- Of course we are.

424
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:54,486
I want the tapes that you made of
our conversation, the original DATs.

425
00:35:54,573 --> 00:36:00,170
- Why would I give you those?
- Because I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.

426
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:03,450
- You've found Hewitt?
- That's right.

427
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,324
Where is he?

428
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:09,449
Don't insult my intelligence.

429
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:14,482
Agree to the exchange, then you can
do whatever you want with him.

430
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:18,728
I want to talk to him.

431
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:24,809
You'll have to hold on. My bodyguard
has him restrained in the next room.

432
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:34,091
All right, Alex, you can talk.

433
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:40,010
It's not what you think. They came in here
with guns and threatened to kill me.

434
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:43,483
I didn't tell them anything
about you, I swear, please.

435
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:47,202
Who's been there, Alex?
Who have you told about this?

436
00:36:47,293 --> 00:36:52,083
- Do we have a deal or not?
- Not until I know what's going on there.

437
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,209
Give me Alex back.

438
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:59,367
I'm not gonna keep this call going on
so that you can trace it. Is it yes or no?

439
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:03,366
Look, this is an ultimatum, Mrs Palmer.

440
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:07,287
You put Alex back on,
or this conversation is ended.

441
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:11,332
You force my hand and
I'll make sure Hewitt tells his story

442
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:13,404
to as many people as possible.

443
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:16,485
It's your final chance, Mrs Palmer.

444
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:23,965
Then it's goodbye, Peter.

445
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:30,644
Fine.

446
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,724
Let's do this.

447
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:35,008
- Neutral ground.
- All right.

448
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:38,722
LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.

449
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:42,886
- Just you and Alex.
- All right.

450
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:49,365
Very good work, Mrs Palmer. Let's go.

451
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,486
Sherry Palmer has Hewitt.

452
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:59,167
What does she want?

453
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:03,849
I get this feeling I'm being set up.

454
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:09,768
Hewitt's just the bait
to draw me out into the open.

455
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,321
So what are you gonna do?

456
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:14,847
I don't have any choice.
I have to play this out.

457
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,527
Scott'll have shooters in place.

458
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:24,246
Sherry Palmer and whoever else she's
involved with in this won't leave there alive.

459
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,928
And then... I'm heading outta the country.

460
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:33,125
Time to roll things up around here.

461
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,204
Now.

462
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,443
Is there anything I can do for you?

463
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,569
You've already done so much.

464
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,326
I'll see you in Lisbon next week.

465
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,646
I am enormously grateful.

466
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:21,244
- What support will you get from CTU?
- As of now, none.

467
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:25,565
Wait. You don't expect to take Kingsley down
by yourself? That's insane!

468
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:28,451
When Kingsley incriminates himself,
CTU will help.

469
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,208
- By then it'll be too late.
- Sorry, that's how it's gonna be.

470
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:38,050
Kingsley will have people with him who will
kill us when they realise we don't have Hewitt.

471
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,488
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

472
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:45,122
- No, you're not. Pull over.
- We don't have time.

473
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:47,443
We've gotta keep moving!

474
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:27,803
Jack? Jack!

475
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:31,611
- Agh!
- Jack!

476
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:00,451

1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,292
- Tony, got a second?
- What is it?

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,251
I think it's time I stepped down. Here you go.

3
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,322
What's this?

4
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:26,248
Access codes to CTU and Division.
You're the new CTU director, Tony.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,609
Let me out of here right now.
I know the bomb didn't go off.

6
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:32,924
- I just wanted some company.
- Then what are you doing out here?

7
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:35,846
- This is where I belong.
- I don't.

8
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,846
Here. Take it. There's cougars out there.

9
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,845
If you see one, fire a shot in the air
and it'll take off.

10
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,448
Roger Stanton confesses that
he's known about the bomb for weeks.

11
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:51,812
You have to trust me, David. Your presidency
is in jeopardy. Let me help you.

12
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,202
No. You'll leave now.

13
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:58,969
If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice
but to place you under arrest.

14
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:02,966
- You gotta give me your badge, Kate.
- No. I don't believe you'd shoot me.

15
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,605
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb?

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,129
You can go to hell, you bastard.
I'm not telling you anything.

17
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:16,525
Why do you want me and my team to leave
here so fast? The bomb's still here, isn't it?

18
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:20,288
Initiate a grid search
on every outbuilding at the airport,

19
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,648
starting at the north end, headed south.

20
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,372
The bomb is on site.
I repeat: the bomb is on site.

21
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,525
- It's armed.
- How much time have we got?

22
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:31,605
I can't tell. It could be any second.

23
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:45,126
Let everyone know
we'll be working in hangar 12.

24
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:48,603
We're on standby here.
Anything you need, Agent Bauer.

25
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,172
Copy that.

26
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:52,244
Right here should be fine.

27
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,004
I need a relay here.

28
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,525
Let me get a look at the circuit panel.

29
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:10,370
They redirected the circuit. Bypass ready.

30
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:15,122
- Easy, easy.
- I got it, I got it. Go ahead.

31
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,602
Let's check out that timer switch.

32
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,366
Hang on. Adjust the flash cap.

33
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,606
It's a little tight. Almost there.

34
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:29,326
- Got it. How's that?
- Wait.

35
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,844
Cap it off.

36
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,530
I need the bypass.

37
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,805
- It worked. We're in good shape.
- Good.

38
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,283
George? What are you doing here?

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,210
This is what killed me.
I'd like to be here when they lay it to rest.

40
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,329
Got it diffused yet?

41
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,689
- Not yet. They're looking at ten minutes.
- Is there a timer?

42
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:12,209
- They haven't been able to read it.
- It could detonate any minute?

43
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,887
George, they've got it under control.

44
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,124
There's gotta be
somewhere else you'd rather be.

45
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:24,049
I promised myself I would see this through
to the end. That's what I'm gonna do.

46
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,764
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'll just take something.

47
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,130
Damn it.

48
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,608
Just give me a minute, OK?

49
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:56,049
- Is there a problem?
- The trigger's tamper-proofed.

50
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,250
I should've seen it, but it was disguised.

51
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:06,289
If it's dismantled or disconnected
from the main casing, it'll detonate.

52
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:11,328
Are you telling me that
there is no way to disarm this bomb?

53
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,802
That's what I'm telling you.

54
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,204
Goodrich.

55
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,851
They can't diffuse it. We'll have to fly it out.

56
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:29,247
This airport doesn't accommodate jets,
so find me the fastest reliable plane you can.

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,530
There's a Cessna Caravan
in front of hangar three.

58
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,649
She's rock solid, cruises at 210.

59
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,042
Get it.

60
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,647
Northwest Regional?

61
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:51,444
This is Jack Bauer. I need to speak
with the president. It's urgent. Thank you.

62
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,651
- Did you get a look at the timer?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:01,249
- How much time have we got?
- 55 minutes.

64
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,403
Need a ride?

65
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,970
- Where are you going?
- Where are you trying to get to?

66
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:59,204
- San Jose.
- No kidding. That's right where I'm headed.

67
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,842
Santa Clara, actually.
It's just a few minutes past San Jose.

68
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,326
- Know what? That's OK. I'm fine, thanks.
- Don't be scared.

69
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,733
- I'm not.
- Then get in.

70
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:19,283
- No point wandering around in the night.
- I'll be fine.

71
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,489
One second you need a ride, next you don't.

72
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:25,122
I'm sorry. It's nice that you pulled over.
It's just that...

73
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:28,364
Get back in the car now.

74
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,930
You don't know how to use that thing.

75
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,811
Get back in the car and keep driving.

76
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,604
Bitch!

77
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,846
- Sir, when will you have a decision?
- When will the plane be ready?

78
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,084
- Ten minutes.
- I'll get back to you before then.

79
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,688
In the meantime, prepare for
the two possibilities we discussed.

80
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:10,651
- And coordinate with the FAA.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:15,249
I want maps and charts for both scenarios.
Pacific Ocean here, desert here.

82
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,451
We're ready to assemble. I'll get back to you
when we have a final decision.

83
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,602
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,406
I wish I had more faith in the reliability...

85
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,768
- Best you can, Mike.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:30,129
I'll discuss consequences
of detonation in the Pacific Ocean.

87
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,408
Lynne will do the same for the Mojave Desert.

88
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,372
In the time available, the plane
can get roughly 80 miles offshore.

89
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:40,446
If it splashes down just before detonation,
the bomb will go off underwater.

90
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,206
The ocean will absorb
a large portion of the radiation.

91
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:48,048
However, prevailing winds
would blow a moderate level of fallout

92
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,647
back over the city of Los Angeles.

93
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:55,932
Over time, there would be a high incidence of
cancer and other radiation-related diseases.

94
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:59,642
- But there'll be no immediate casualty.
- We can't be certain.

95
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,692
The shipping lanes into the port
of Los Angeles are extremely busy.

96
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,048
In the 80 square miles off the coast of LA,

97
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:10,206
the Coast Guard counts two dozen freighters
flying flags from around the world,

98
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:14,525
plus an unknown number
of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels.

99
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:18,811
It's likely that one or more of them
would be sunk or capsized by the blast.

100
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,088
What's the impact on the environment?

101
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:25,530
The blast will wipe out
a substantial pocket of biodiversity.

102
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:29,845
Keystone species would be exterminated,
the food chain would be contaminated,

103
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,482
and the regional ecological
infrastructure would collapse.

104
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:37,930
Marine resources such as
offshore drilling, commercial fishing,

105
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:44,202
even recreational beach usage would become
hazardous or impossible for many years.

106
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:49,242
The ecological and economic effects,
Mr President, would be devastating.

107
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,611
- What about the desert?
- We can designate a ground zero.

108
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,288
It's isolated, so inhabited areas
won't be immediately affected.

109
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:02,731
Towns could be evacuated within hours
without any serious long-term effects.

110
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:06,522
We can't rule out the possibility
of isolated campers and hikers,

111
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,003
who would be killed
or contaminated by the blast.

112
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:13,608
If the wind shifts substantially
during the next few hours,

113
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,207
it could blow fallout over Las Vegas.

114
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:21,606
The best meteorological projections indicate
that that is a very, very slight possibility.

115
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,843
Long-term effects?

116
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:29,929
An area of a few square miles around ground
zero would be highly radioactive for decades,

117
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:35,246
but the truth is we don't get food or any
significant resources from the desert anyway.

118
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,212
So the overall health risk is relatively small.

119
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:44,082
Sounds like the desert's our best option.

120
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:49,327
Yes, sir, we do agree with that.
But there is one more thing.

121
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:52,610
In the desert, ground zero
has to be a precise location.

122
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,765
A depression, below sea level
and surrounded by mountains,

123
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:58,447
so it could hopefully contain the fallout.

124
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,923
Potential target sites
are being researched as we speak.

125
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:06,529
- All right.
- Point is, the airplane isn't a military craft.

126
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:11,289
It doesn't have any of the equipment
needed to deliver a payload accurately.

127
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:17,369
To ensure the necessary level of precision,
a pilot will have to go down with the plane.

128
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:22,732
- It's a suicide mission.
- Why can't we push it out the side door?

129
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:25,281
It's too imprecise, sir.

130
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:30,652
If the pilot is flying low enough to ensure
accuracy, he would be killed by the blast.

131
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:37,172
One man dies, Mr President,
to ensure the safety of millions.

132
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,203
- Jack?
- Mr President?

133
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,329
- The desert.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,291
Jack, my people tell me
that the pilot has to die.

135
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:57,208
CTU came to the same conclusion. The bomb
has to be put down on specific coordinates.

136
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,568
I'm sorry, but there isn't another way.

137
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,928
Do we know who the pilot will be?

138
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:06,282
We have a few volunteers, sir.
All of them good men.

139
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:11,970
Whoever it is, tell him he has the undying
gratitude of every citizen of this country.

140
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:17,769
And tell him we will take care
of whatever family he leaves behind.

141
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,845
- Yes, sir. I will.
- I'll be standing by, Jack.

142
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,562
- Call me back when the plane's in the air.
- Yes, Mr President.

143
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:35,364
Funny, I don't see any volunteers.
When was the last time you flew a plane?

144
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,921
I can get it in the air
and put it down, George.

145
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:43,645
So can I. I'm current, I'm instrument-rated,
and I'm gonna be dead by the end of the day.

146
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:48,170
- Problem is, you could be dead any minute.
- I can hang on for another half-hour.

147
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:52,929
If you blacked out and it went down before
it got to the desert, a lot of people will die.

148
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,562
- Come on, Jack.
- I know what you’re trying to do.

149
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:00,612
But I gotta say no. Agent Goodrich,
this is Bauer. They chose the desert.

150
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,527
I want you to clear air space
and start immediate evacuation now.

151
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:08,811
Gentlemen! Load this bomb. We are a go!

152
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:34,451
- It's not rated as a priority.
- I don't care. Just do it, all right?

153
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,251
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

154
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,406
All right, Mr Auda. Wait here a second.
We'll be right with you.

155
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:45,685
- Agent Graves.
- Tony Almeida. We've been expecting you.

156
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:49,527
- They told you what's in the case?
- Personal effects from Ali's safe house?

157
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:51,046
Who's he?

158
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:55,206
His name is Yusuf Auda.
His government assigned him as a liaison.

159
00:12:55,293 --> 00:13:00,321
They gave us information that got us in the
safe house. We couldn't refuse to bring him.

160
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,167
- Do you trust him?
- Right now? I don't trust anyone.

161
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:08,212
Yeah. Take the case and bring it into
that conference room around the corner.

162
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,931
- OK.
- Thank you.

163
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:14,006
- Tony Almeida, Director of CTU. Welcome.
- Thank you.

164
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,529
Must have had some trip.
You were 10,000 miles away this morning.

165
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,524
I'm ready to get back to work.

166
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:24,641
I understand analysis needs to be done
on things seized from Syed Ali's apartment.

167
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,885
Yeah. Our lab needs to do
some preliminary work first.

168
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:33,888
I'll have somebody get you coffee.
I'll be with you in a moment, OK? Thank you.

169
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,124
The lab is ready for decryption.

170
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:46,128
Good. Look, I might need somebody
to do a little handholding here.

171
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,488
That man's name over there is Yusuf Auda.

172
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:52,964
Officially, he's a visiting intelligence agent
entitled to full cooperation.

173
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:57,126
Unofficially, I don't want him to see
anything he doesn't need to see.

174
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,602
Make sure anybody you assign understands.

175
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,127
- Sure.
- OK.

176
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:08,492
I'm gonna deal with this Mr Auda myself.
If you need any help, call Jacobs.

177
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:12,725
- Tony told you to assign someone to Auda.
- I'm assigning myself.

178
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:16,203
You're still not comfortable
working with me, are you?

179
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,046
Just do your job, Carrie.

180
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:30,691
- So, what have we got?
- Most of it's innocuous. There is one thing.

181
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:35,085
This was well-concealed.
Obviously it was of great importance to Ali.

182
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:39,769
We tried to read it, but it's encrypted.
We don't have that technology in the field.

183
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:44,051
OK. I'll get our people on it right away,
see what they can find.

184
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,124
- OK.
- Thanks.

185
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,807
Sure.

186
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,733
- Almeida.
- Tony, have you found Kim yet?

187
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,283
- No. We're still working on it.
- I'm running out of time.

188
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:04,810
I understand, but we got our hands full.
If you could wait until the plane takes off...

189
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:07,965
- Tony, I'm flying it.
- What?!

190
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:11,170
I'd like to speak with my daughter
while I still got time.

191
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,528
There's gotta be somebody else to fly it.

192
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,525
Somebody that doesn't have a family
or at least no kids.

193
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:20,083
I didn't have time to take a census.
I can't order anyone to do this.

194
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,482
Please, Tony, you've gotta find her.

195
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,762
- I'll find her.
- Tony, one other thing.

196
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:30,332
Yeah?

197
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:33,363
In my apartment, there's a safe.

198
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:38,049
Inside is my will and a letter I wrote to Kim
in case something ever happened to me.

199
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,124
I'll make sure she gets it, Jack.

200
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:45,162
- Thanks.
- I'll get back to you.

201
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:14,367
- You all right, honey?
- I could use a lift.

202
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,331
What are you doing way out here?

203
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:24,449
I was on a date and we parked.
He got a little out of hand, so I got out.

204
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,684
Hop in.

205
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:43,524
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

206
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:46,047
Where would you like to go?

207
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:49,011
I have an aunt in San Jose.

208
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:54,486
You were on a date, it didn't work out,
so you're going to your aunt's in San Jose.

209
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:58,282
Honey, your business is your business,
but I'm not an idiot, OK?

210
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:05,609
I know. It's just been crazy, and it's a long
story, and I'm kind of in a little bit of trouble.

211
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:09,163
If you have a cellphone,
I actually really need to make a call.

212
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:12,165
- To whom?
- My father.

213
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:24,042
We synchronised this
with the timer on the bomb.

214
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,169
Thank you.

215
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,769
Good luck.

216
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:53,006
So the plane has some
automatic pilot thing?

217
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:57,132
Actually, no. It'll have to be flown out
to a very precise location.

218
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,727
So the pilot...

219
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,684
Oh, my God. Who's it gonna be?

220
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,003
Jack Bauer.

221
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,364
Jack!

222
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,290
I'm sorry, Miss Warner,
but you’re gonna have to stay here.

223
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,571
Cessna 47 Fox requesting immediate takeoff.

224
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:58,250
- 47 Fox, you're clear on runway three.
- Roger that, tower. Thank you.

225
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:42,444
Here's your preliminary draft
for your statement tomorrow.

226
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:46,731
- Yes. Right. Thank you.
- How's the plane doing, Mike?

227
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:50,123
- It's at 3,000 feet and climbing.
- Out of the city yet?

228
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:56,209
It's too soon for that, but they'll clear
the main population centres in ten minutes.

229
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,012
This is a good start,
but I want to go over it again.

230
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:04,326
Call Davis. I want him to get
Air Force One ready as soon as possible.

231
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,086
Sir?

232
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:11,007
- Do you mind if I ask where you're going?
- Los Angeles.

233
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:18,691
Mr President, if I may speak frankly,
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

234
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:22,482
It may be a little too "hands-on",
for lack of a better term.

235
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:27,010
The people want to feel that you’re
managing events, not caught up in them.

236
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:31,769
And, in any case, I doubt if
the Secret Service will even hear of it.

237
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:34,845
Secret Service works for me.
I don't work for them.

238
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,322
Mr President.

239
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,967
Sir, I do agree with Mike.

240
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:47,127
Once word gets out that this bomb has
gone off, there's bound to be civil unrest.

241
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,807
I don't think you should
be associated with that.

242
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:52,805
The whole country
will be traumatised by this bomb,

243
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:55,088
especially the people in Los Angeles.

244
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:58,961
I'm gonna reassure them that
everything is under control. Understood?

245
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,772
Yes, sir. I'll call Davis immediately.

246
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:05,448
Thank you. We'll leave for the airport now.

247
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:10,047
Mike, who ended up flying the plane?
Did you get a name?

248
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,331
Yes, sir.

249
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,404
Jack Bauer.

250
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:22,688
I'd have told you sooner, but I figured
you had enough on your mind already.

251
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:40,047
Cessna 47 Fox,
climb to 10,000 feet, 0-8-niner.

252
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,045
Roger. 0-8-niner. 10,000 feet.

253
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,488
Expect final vectors in five minutes.

254
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,245
I copy.

255
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:55,726
Agent Bauer, I've got Tony Almeida. I'm
patching him through. Hold on one second.

256
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,691
- Jack, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

257
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:01,810
We found Kim. She's on the other line.

258
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:05,010
Thank you, Tony. Good work.
Have you told her anything?

259
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:08,051
No. I didn't know if you'd want me to.

260
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,482
OK.

261
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:15,009
- Put her through, will ya?
- All right.

262
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:19,441
- Kim?
- Dad! Finally. Oh, my God, are you OK?

263
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:23,606
- I'm OK, sweetheart. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

264
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:26,685
Thank God.
You've had a hell of a day, haven’t you?

265
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:31,927
- Yeah. What's that noise? Where are you?
- I'm in a plane.

266
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:34,481
A plane? Why?

267
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:40,967
There's something I've gotta tell you. It'll be
hard to hear, so I need you to stick with me.

268
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:47,245
We found the bomb. It was wired in a way
that made it impossible to diffuse it.

269
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:52,691
We needed someone to fly it over the desert,
so when it exploded nobody would get killed.

270
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:55,241
That someone turned out to be me.

271
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,211
How are you getting off the plane?

272
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,008
I'm not, sweetheart.

273
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:14,325
The bomb has to be dropped in a very
specific area. There was no other choice.

274
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:16,529
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:21,447
But... Dad?

276
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,441
- Dad, no! No, you can't do this to me!
- Kim.

277
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,492
- There has to be somebody else!
- I didn't have any other choice.

278
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:36,691
- Kim, I need you to listen to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

279
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:41,972
- Sweetheart, what are you sorry for?
- Oh, God, everything.

280
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:46,012
I've been so mean and so bad to you.

281
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:52,089
Honey, anything that ever happened
between us... it was never your fault.

282
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:58,328
I love you just the way you are. I don't ever
want you to change, you understand that?

283
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:01,450
I love you more than anything in the world.

284
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:08,043
Kim, can you still hear me?

285
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,363
Yes.

286
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,088
Honey, I want you to live your life.
I want you to be happy.

287
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,085
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

288
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:22,047
I want you to try and grow up
and be the kind of person

289
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:26,968
that would have made your mom proud, OK?

290
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:29,169
Oh, God.

291
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,563
Promise me that.

292
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:36,407
I promise.

293
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:47,211
Honey, I've gotta start focusing on what
I'm doing up here. I'm running out of time.

294
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:49,887
I'm gonna have to say goodbye.

295
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:55,446
I love you more than anything in the world
and I will always be with you, OK?

296
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,524
Remember that.

297
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:04,885
I'm proud of you... and I love you.

298
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:12,563
- I love you, too, sweetheart.
- No.

299
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:15,962
Goodbye.

300
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:44,962
I'm sorry, honey. What do you want to do?

301
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:49,287
- I gotta get out of here.
- What do you mean? Why?

302
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,524
I was supposed to get out of LA,
but it doesn't matter any more.

303
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:56,686
No, wait a minute. This is crazy.
Wait. Just wait. Call someone else.

304
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:59,287
I can't. I'm OK. I need to be alone.

305
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:14,244
You OK?

306
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,444
We found Kim.

307
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,492
- Jack get a chance to say goodbye?
- Yeah.

308
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,564
So what'd you find?

309
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:27,008
We decrypted Ali's hard drive.

310
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:31,132
It's a recording of conversation
that took place four months ago.

311
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:33,681
Conversation between who?

312
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:40,246
Syed Ali and high-ranking government
officials from these three countries.

313
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:51,132
What we're saying is that these three
countries not only knew about the bomb,

314
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:53,932
but they bought it
and supplied it to Syed Ali?

315
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:58,768
- Yeah. That's what it looks like.
- How sure are we about this translation?

316
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:05,042
We were rushed, it needs to be refined,
but the substance of it is accurate.

317
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:10,203
We'll need voice authentication
on all four of these men.

318
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:15,162
- I've already got people working on it.
- Get Division involved as well.

319
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:23,210
- Northwest Regional?
- Tony Almeida at CTU.

320
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:26,603
I need to speak to the president
about today's terrorist attack.

321
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:28,684
I'll transfer you.

322
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:38,532
What is it, Mr Almeida?

323
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:42,447
We have a recording of Syed Ali
collaborating with high-ranking officials

324
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:46,651
from three Middle Eastern countries
in preparation for today's attack.

325
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,885
- When did this come to our attention?
- Just within the last few minutes.

326
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:54,249
- Who else knows?
- Our Division headquarters, sir.

327
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,848
They have ties to the other agencies,
which means everybody knows.

328
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,845
I tagged it with a section-four security, sir.

329
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:06,132
But I did think it was important to get going
on the authentication process quickly.

330
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:09,569
- How long will that be?
- We should have confirmation in an hour.

331
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:13,089
Let me ask you another question, Mr Almeida.

332
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:16,802
Why would Syed Ali record
a conversation like this in the first place?

333
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:21,205
Half the time these people don't trust
each other any more than they trust us.

334
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:24,569
My guess is Ali wanted
some ammunition to protect himself,

335
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:28,407
in case any of these three countries
ever turned against him.

336
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:29,243
All right.

337
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,849
Thank you, Mr Almeida.
I'll let you get back to work. Good job.

338
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,686
Please pass on my appreciation to your staff.

339
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:39,571
- Thank you, Mr President.
- Thank you.

340
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:45,842
Three governments in the Middle East
may be behind this bomb.

341
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,003
Yes, sir. I gathered that.

342
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,127
We could be at war soon, Mike.

343
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:08,164
And once it begins... there's no guarantee
it'll be limited to these three countries.

344
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:17,802
I've been thinking all day about something
Lincoln said during the Civil War.

345
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:20,851
"I don't claim to have controlled events

346
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:25,404
but confess plainly
that events have controlled me."

347
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:31,402
It's bad enough that someone tried
to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here.

348
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,643
Worse that they succeeded.

349
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:40,332
But once this bomb actually goes off,
my options will narrow very, very quickly.

350
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:56,692
This is Cessna 47 Fox. I have just
crossed over to the low desert.

351
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:59,685
I'm on final line to target.
Any change in my coordinates?

352
00:29:59,773 --> 00:30:05,450
- Negative. They're confirmed as given.
- Copy that. Confirming autopilot 0-8-niner.

353
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:10,049
- Coordinates are now locked.
- Roger. Over.

354
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,284
- Don't move!
- Hey, hey, hey.

355
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:31,683
The service is bad enough.
You don't have to shoot me.

356
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:35,243
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I felt like taking a ride.

357
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,608
How the hell did you get on this plane?

358
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:40,969
Wasn't that hard.
To them, I'm still head of CTU.

359
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:44,926
Son of a bitch.

360
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,842
Brought something for ya.

361
00:30:50,773 --> 00:30:52,172
It's a parachute.

362
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:57,452
I can see what is it, George.
I already told you, I'm taking this plane in.

363
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,172
That might have made sense
back on the ground,

364
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,813
but let's face it, Jack, the hard part's over.

365
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:05,453
You took off, cleared the city.

366
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:10,653
What's left but flying straight and level
and taking it into a dive?

367
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:13,122
Am I right?

368
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:17,565
Unless of course maybe you wanna die.

369
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:24,932
- What are you talking about?
- You've had a death wish since Teri died.

370
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,732
The way things have been going
for you the past year,

371
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:31,010
this probably doesn't
look like such a bad idea.

372
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:36,247
You get to go out in a blaze of glory,
one of the greatest heroes of all time.

373
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,972
Leave your troubles behind.

374
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:45,772
This could be the easy
way out, huh?

375
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:52,403
You still got a life, Jack.
You wanna be a real hero, here's what you do.

376
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:56,406
You get back down there
and you put the pieces together.

377
00:31:56,493 --> 00:32:00,202
Find a way to forgive yourself
for what happened to your wife,

378
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:05,845
you make things right with your daughter,
and you go on serving your country.

379
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:08,288
That'd take some real guts.

380
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:21,163
Go on, Jack. You got 12 minutes.

381
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:25,212
What's it gonna be? You wanna live or not?

382
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:38,042
- You really think you can do this?
- Yes.

383
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:42,322
You are absolutely sure you can do this?

384
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:46,410
Jack, I'm supposed to do this.

385
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:59,163
You need to maintain
this heading and this airspeed.

386
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:04,247
The second the LAD reads a minute and
a half, you initiate a dive at a 30-degree angle.

387
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:11,132
- Won't that get me in early?
- That's the point.

388
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:17,049
You have to be certain that the bomb is
already in the depression before it goes off.

389
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,124
I got it.

390
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,008
Thank you, George.

391
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,524
Thank you.

392
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:58,446
Get your chute on
and get the hell outta here.

393
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:02,811
- I'm staying with you as long as possible.
- I got it together. I'm fine.

394
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:07,091
This is not negotiable.
I'm bailing out four minutes before impact.

395
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:09,403
That should get me far enough away.

396
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:12,166
This is Jack Bauer. Patch me through to CTU.

397
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,926
- Yes, sir. Right away.
- Almeida.

398
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:19,211
Tony, this is Jack. I need you to get
a helicopter in the air immediately.

399
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:23,730
We got a change of plans here. I'm bailing
out. George is taking the plane down.

400
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,212
What's George doing there?

401
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:28,330
We need authentication
from three sources for each voice.

402
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:33,646
Division has public speeches from ministers.
See if you can get his voice on phone taps.

403
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,724
Michelle.

404
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:41,971
Send a chopper to trail Jack's plane.
Mason got on board. Don't ask how.

405
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:46,046
He'll take the plane the rest of the way.
We need that chopper to pick Jack up.

406
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,852
I'll explain later.

407
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:52,243
Mr Almeida, may I know
what you found on the hard drive?

408
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:56,645
- You don't have security clearance.
- Mr Almeida.

409
00:34:56,733 --> 00:35:03,081
I and my country have shown good faith
in helping you to find Syed Ali's safe house.

410
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:07,007
I'm asking you to do the same
by giving me some idea of what's going on.

411
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:11,325
- I'm sorry, but I can't tell you at this time.
- You Americans.

412
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:17,002
- We Americans what?
- Nothing.

413
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,608
Come.

414
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:40,402
- Sir, General Bowden's here to see you.
- Of course. Show him in.

415
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,608
- Mr President.
- General Bowden.

416
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:50,130
I understand the bomb is over the Mojave.
It may detonate without causing loss of life.

417
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:53,205
- That is our hope.
- That's wonderful news.

418
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:57,206
- Congratulations on your achievement.
- Thank you, General.

419
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:01,605
Perhaps it's appropriate to begin
discussing the matter of retaliation.

420
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,729
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:09,092
The Joint Chiefs have been assuming
the bomb was the work of Second Wave.

422
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:11,926
It appears they had the backing
of three governments.

423
00:36:12,013 --> 00:36:15,722
- That's not definite yet, General.
- No, sir. I understand that.

424
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:18,771
But for planning purposes,
we should proceed as if it is.

425
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:22,812
I request authority to activate plans
to invade the countries in question.

426
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:26,442
Activate? There are plans
already in existence?

427
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:30,492
We have plans for every conceivable
contingency, Mr President.

428
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:34,691
I see. So what exactly
do you mean by activate?

429
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:39,483
Putting the relevant military units on alert,
beginning logistical operations,

430
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:43,532
coordinating sources regarding
the probable level of resistance

431
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:46,764
to an invasion by American forces.

432
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:48,809
Talk of an invasion is premature.

433
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:52,932
I agree, Mr President.
This is in the planning stages only.

434
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:02,246
Activate your plan. But take no steps
to implement without my direct authorisation.

435
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,927
Of course, Mr President.

436
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:13,292
Lynne.

437
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,164
We may be talking about World War III.

438
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:36,930
OK. I'm set.

439
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:40,801
George, is there anything
you want me to take care of?

440
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,690
Oddly enough, I think I got
everything squared away.

441
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:48,243
I even got to spend a little time with my son.

442
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,722
I didn't even know you had one.

443
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:56,608
- I'm glad you got to see him.
- Yeah. Me, too.

444
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:59,491
I don't think he was particularly, but...

445
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:03,327
Actually, I wouldn't mind
if you checked in on him.

446
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,482
Of course I will.

447
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:26,567
- It's time.
- Yeah.

448
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:10,767
Yeah.

449
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,804
Mr President.

450
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:22,648
At this altitude, the explosion
should be visible on the eastern horizon.

451
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,805
I don't know if you want to take a look.

452
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,690
Three, two...

453
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:01,091

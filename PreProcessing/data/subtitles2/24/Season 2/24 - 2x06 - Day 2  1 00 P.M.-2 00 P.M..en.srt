1
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:16,131
Roger, it's good to see you.

2
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:20,286
I'd like to talk to you about this meeting.
I don't trust the ambassador.

3
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:23,604
It's possible that his country's
supporting Second Wave.

4
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,605
We want to prevent this incident.

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,570
We need access to your files.

6
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,121
I want you to monitor
how they use our intel.

7
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:35,402
It's the ambassador's chopper.
It crashed just after takeoff.

8
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:39,610
- There's a man who needs to talk to you.
- Who is he?

9
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:42,207
He's from the Counter Terrorism Agency?

10
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,204
I told you, I do not know a Syed Ali.

11
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:48,445
Then how do you explain that his name
is in your personal computer files?

12
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:53,523
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
Do what I tell you. Go now.

13
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,012
Miguel, get over here.

14
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,731
There's a nuclear bomb in the city.

15
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,611
- Let's get outta here.
- Not without Megan.

16
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:03,887
George, I got to Wald. I found out
who commissioned him to take out CTU.

17
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:05,964
- Who was it?
- It was Nina Myers.

18
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:06,963
Nina?

19
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,408
Nina killed your wife.
I don't want you near her.

20
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:12,053
I have to grant her
a shadow asylum.

21
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,964
That sounds like a pardon, sir.

22
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:17,125
She has information
that could help us find this bomb.

23
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:19,807
- What is it?
- They're gonna let her go.

24
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:24,451
I know you were exposed to high levels
of radioactive materials this morning.

25
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:28,651
I wanna know what your plans are for Nina.
I want the case. I know how she thinks.

26
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,692
If you don't do this, I'll tell District
about your condition. They'll replace you.

27
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:23,963
Palmer just signed the pardon. So, as soon
as it gets here, we'll start the interrogation.

28
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:41,445
- Nina's file.
- I don't need it.

29
00:02:58,293 --> 00:02:59,612
The president's here.

30
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,125
Mr President...

31
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:21,048
Mr President, can you give us any
details about the helicopter crash?

32
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:27,447
- Who was on the aircraft? Any survivors?
- Is it related to the bombing in LA?

33
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,967
We can't disclose information
about the crash

34
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:33,011
until the families of the victims
have been notified.

35
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:37,166
But I promise you, there will be
a careful and thorough investigation.

36
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,244
- Mr President...
- Let's go.

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:44,123
We will be putting out a formal statement
as soon as we get those issues resolved,

38
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:48,365
and I ask everyone to refrain
from speculation until that time.

39
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:51,490
No one besides Jenny releases
a statement on the crash.

40
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,531
No names, no speculation.
And keep the lid on tight.

41
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,604
Absolutely, sir.

42
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,243
Hello, David.

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,245
How did you get in here
without my authorisation?

44
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:21,010
We were married for many years. Many
people respect that, even if you don't.

45
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,811
I need to talk to you.

46
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:27,125
We have nothing more to talk about.
You're not my wife any more.

47
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,807
- It's not about us.
- Then what?

48
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:37,601
Not here. I need to be alone with you.

49
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,411
You know what?

50
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:44,203
Even if I were interested in what
you had to say, today is impossible.

51
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,853
You shouldn't have come here.

52
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,005
- It's about your administration.
- What about it?

53
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:53,051
- Just give me five minutes.
- I don't have time now.

54
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:59,049
Did you order an evacuation of
military personnel out of Los Angeles?

55
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:18,004
Who told you that?

56
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,963
Five minutes, David.

57
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,523
Wait here.

58
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,002
I'll call you.

59
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:38,770
Do we know about the military
moving personnel out of LA?

60
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:43,483
No. Sir, you specifically requested
there be no evacuation.

61
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,133
- Check into it.
- I certainly will.

62
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,169
You're doing business
with a known terrorist,

63
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:56,249
and you sit there with a straight face
and tell me you don't know what's going on?

64
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:04,652
I grew up in London. I'm marrying
an American girl, a Protestant.

65
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,572
So, if you're going to racially profile me,

66
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,322
you should at least get it right.

67
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:17,803
Our main targets are European Muslims

68
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:20,965
with western educations, passports,

69
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:25,365
and the potential
to blend into western society.

70
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:30,886
So tell me, Reza,
how's my racial profiling going now?

71
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,603
I want a lawyer.

72
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,852
No.

73
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:43,566
- Did they find the black box yet?
- Not yet, Mr President.

74
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,803
How could something like this happen?

75
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:51,604
I don't know. I've opened a multi-agency
investigation. NTSB is on the way.

76
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,571
Lynne, schedule a call
with the prime minister.

77
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,441
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna talk to him before rumours start.

78
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:03,561
But I'm afraid they may not be far from
the truth. This was not an accident.

79
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:07,089
I'm thinking along
the same lines, Mr President.

80
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:12,645
The prime minister may not have been happy
about the ambassador's cooperation with us.

81
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,691
There's another possibility, Roger.

82
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,606
I'm not following you, sir.

83
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,931
- That we did it.
- Correct.

84
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,725
That hardly seems likely.

85
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:28,522
The ambassador took classified
information back to his government.

86
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:32,811
- You both thought it was questionable.
- And if we were talking about it here,

87
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:37,284
you can bet there are others back
in DC who feel even more strongly.

88
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,969
Set up an independent investigator.
Let's find out exactly who was in the loop.

89
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,611
Yes, sir.

90
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,133
OK, this is it. Here we go.

91
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,652
I'll show her this, I'll let her start talking.

92
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,203
Then I'll get you the stuff
she doesn't want us to know.

93
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:07,571
The last time I let you interrogate
somebody, you shot him through the heart.

94
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,804
I'm letting you do this,
but I hope I'm not making a mistake.

95
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:13,248
No mistake, George.

96
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,204
All right. Good luck.

97
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,331
Let's keep this simple.

98
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:17,567
If you wanna stop the bomb,
I need to be on a plane to Visalia now.

99
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:22,124
Did you pick Visalia for a reason, or would
anywhere outside the blast zone work?

100
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,569
- My contact is in Visalia.
- Who is it?

101
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:29,202
The only person who can
tell us where the bomb is.

102
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,490
I'm not gonna tell you who it is
till we get there.

103
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:37,852
Fine. Then you can sit here
and wait for the blast to hit.

104
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:41,562
Stop wasting time.
I have the president's signature.

105
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:44,292
I'm here. He's not.

106
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:47,968
And I'm not gonna make a move
until I believe you're credible.

107
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:52,410
I'll only get the pardon if I stop the bomb.
Why wouldn't I do everything I can?

108
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,485
Because you're worse than a traitor, Nina.

109
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:58,690
You don't have a cause.
You don't believe in anything.

110
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:01,845
But you would sell anyone out
to the highest bidder.

111
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:06,051
So stop wasting my time! Gimme a name!

112
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,604
Don't even bother, Jack.

113
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:15,481
If you lay a hand on me,
you'll be taken off the case.

114
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:39,683
You're just gonna have to follow my lead.

115
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,489
Tell me everything I wanna know,

116
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:55,930
or I swear to God, I will hurt you
before I kill you and no one will stop me.

117
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,971
- Do you understand?
- Jack, let her go! Now!

118
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:19,206
- All right, you're done. Get outta here.
- Why?

119
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,761
Why? Because you've lost it! That's why.

120
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,641
Right now she thinks she's
won the lottery. She's in control.

121
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,167
You want her to tell the truth, take that away.

122
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,164
By killing her? That'll work.

123
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:33,563
By giving her someone to answer to,
someone to be afraid of.

124
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:37,965
She has to believe I'd be willing to put
my revenge over finding this bomb.

125
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:41,966
- And you're telling me you're not.
- George, it had to look like that.

126
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,887
Look at me. There's no emotion here.

127
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,123
Now look at her.

128
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:54,123
- What would your next move be?
- You need to let me go back in there,

129
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:59,446
show her that I have the power
to do anything I want to her.

130
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:11,207
- If I let you go back in there, you've got...
- All I need is five minutes.

131
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:18,483
Just don't let anyone in that room
and raise the thermostat ten degrees.

132
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,365
Are you gonna let me have five minutes?

133
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:25,801
Yeah.

134
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,412
Thank you.

135
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:43,369
In the latest update,
we have Mr President requesting...

136
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,603
We need to talk.

137
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,006
I told you to leave.

138
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:03,561
Well...

139
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:06,121
I'm not leaving.

140
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm your sister,

141
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,366
and you can stay angry with me,

142
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,889
but we need to figure out
what we're going to do.

143
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,771
Do about what?

144
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,844
The wedding.

145
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,413
We may have to cancel.

146
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:33,328
That would make you happy, wouldn't it?
Isn't that what you wanted all along?

147
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,371
No. Not the marriage, Marie.

148
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,523
Just the wedding.

149
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,765
We can't do it today.
Let me help you take care of it.

150
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,526
You are always pretending
you wanna help me.

151
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,604
Pretending?

152
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:55,929
I dropped out of school when Mom died to
take care of you, to keep this family together.

153
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:59,085
So you'd have an excuse
for not having a relationship.

154
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,405
"Dad needs me. Marie needs me." Now I don't
need you any more, you can't handle it!

155
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:07,486
- I made sacrifices because...
- Then stop! Mom died a long time ago!

156
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:12,328
So get your own life and stay outta mine!
We are not cancelling this wedding!

157
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:20,082
She's not in intensive care or
the east wing. She's gotta be up here.

158
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:23,210
How much time do we have to this nuke?

159
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:26,888
- I don't know.
- What if Megan doesn't wanna come with us?

160
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:28,964
I don't know.

161
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,884
That's him.

162
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:42,242
Mr Matheson?

163
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:50,368
The MRI confirmed that the pressure on
the brain was the result of the concussion.

164
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,487
Meaning?

165
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:58,125
That we won't release her until questions
about the sources of her injuries are resolved.

166
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:03,206
Of course. Listen, I just wanna
do what's best for my little girl.

167
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:08,126
Good. I'll check in on her
at the end of my rounds.

168
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:15,290
And, Mr Matheson, no cellphones in the
hospital. They interfere with the equipment.

169
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,603
Of course. Sorry.

170
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,610
Daddy, are you still mad at me?

171
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,971
No, sweetie, no. Everything's fine.
Daddy's just tired.

172
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,772
You need to get dressed, OK?

173
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:37,731
- Mr Matheson's office.
- Chelsea, it's me.

174
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,965
Do something for me. Book me two seats
on the next flight to Mexico City.

175
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:46,365
- But you have a meeting...
- I know. I'm asking you to cancel it.

176
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:50,526
- What about your five o'clock?
- Cancel everything.

177
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:03,886
Who is the man in Visalia?

178
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:11,172
Who is the man in Visalia?

179
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:14,529
Mamud Faheen.
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.

180
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,763
That's not news! We've got his name!

181
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,811
But you don't know where he is. I do.

182
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:24,330
- What's the history of the relationship?
- He introduced me to Wald.

183
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:29,248
So Wald could buy the schematics
for CTU and blow it up as a diversion?

184
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,769
I didn't know it was part of a plan
to detonate a nuclear device.

185
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:35,367
Then why are you so sure
Faheen's involved?

186
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,889
I heard hints that he was involved
in something in Los Angeles.

187
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:41,487
Something substantial.

188
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,405
Where is he in Visalia now?

189
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:56,327
I'm not gonna give you his location
until we get there.

190
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:04,209
If you could get to him, you wouldn't need
me. My deal would do me no good if I'm dead.

191
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,284
Get me Visalia.

192
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,452
Sir...

193
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,807
Sherry was right. An evacuation of
military personnel began about an hour ago,

194
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,884
which means it is well under way.

195
00:17:54,973 --> 00:18:00,730
- Do we know where this order came from?
- Yes, we do, sir. Roger Stanton.

196
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,208
Countermand the evacuation.

197
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,047
All forces already moving are to
return to their bases immediately.

198
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,124
Yes, sir.

199
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,527
Roger. My office, please.

200
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:18,243
Janet? Hi, this is Lynne. I'm gonna need
contacts for the following bases:

201
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,483
Point Mugu, Camp Pendleton.

202
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:28,722
I got word that military resources
were being moved out of LA.

203
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,690
- Yes.
- On your order.

204
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:36,643
Yes. I was implementing the plan.
I assumed you authorised it.

205
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:40,726
No, I told Rayburn not to
trigger any evacuation.

206
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:50,090
I should have double-checked everything
Rayburn told me before I took any action.

207
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:54,485
Mr President, it's inexcusable.
I take full responsibility.

208
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,041
We'll worry about that later.

209
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:01,968
I just told Lynne to countermand
the evacuation order.

210
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:06,524
- Make sure it happens immediately.
- Right away, sir.

211
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:18,004
- Can I help you, Mr President?
- Yes. Tell Sherry I'll meet her in 20 minutes.

212
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,086
You know how much
Daddy loves you, don’t you?

213
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:28,806
And you know how sorry I am that
my little angel ever got hurt, right?

214
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,804
Listen, pal, we're leaving now, OK?

215
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:46,047
So if anybody tries to talk to you,
you just... you don't say a word. OK?

216
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:50,092
Just pretend you're asleep.
You can do that, right?

217
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:51,492
- OK.
- OK.

218
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,484
Mr Matheson?

219
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,681
There's a call for you.

220
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,491
A call?

221
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:05,606
- You can take it at the nurse's station.
- Why can't I take it in here?

222
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,845
Because we don't have phones
in the rooms unless you order one.

223
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,286
You stay there, OK?

224
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,242
Megan, don't move.

225
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,849
- Looks like she'll be fine.
- OK.

226
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,812
- OK? Just running a few other tests.
- Is it gonna be much longer?

227
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,611
The phone's right in there.

228
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,082
So let's go take a look, OK?

229
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,965
- This is Gary Matheson.
- Mr Matheson?

230
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,489
- Yeah, who is this?
- This is Trey in Accounts Receivable.

231
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:50,964
Our computers crashed, and we lost
a lot of your billing information.

232
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:54,125
So if we could just go over it again...

233
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:58,206
- Can we do this another time, please?
- No, we need it now, sir.

234
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,807
I can send someone up
to your daughter's room.

235
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,369
No. What do you need?

236
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,327
- Hi, Kim.
- Hi, sweetie.

237
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:19,967
- Listen, do you trust me?
- Yes.

238
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:22,802
I need to get you outta here.

239
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:28,889
All I can tell you is I'm doing this because
I love you and I want you to be safe. OK?

240
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:38,890
OK.

241
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,645
Come on.

242
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,772
- The expiration date?
- It expires March 2007, OK?

243
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:48,641
Great. Now if we could just
go over your billing address.

244
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,201
You know what? I'll come down later.

245
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,284
Mr Matheson?

246
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,485
Megan?

247
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:15,930
- My daughter's gone.
- Did you try the bathroom?

248
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:19,972
- Yes. She's not there.
- She might have been taken to radiology.

249
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:22,442
Well, find out where she is.

250
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,524
Yes, of course.

251
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:33,289
Dr Shapiro, 2262. Dr Shapiro, 2262.

252
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:56,889
- Where are we going, Kim?
- I told you, you have to trust me.

253
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:59,533
I just got off the phone. Come on.

254
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:01,808
I changed my mind. I don't wanna go.

255
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:07,047
My daddy's gonna get really mad, and then
he's gonna hurt me. I don't wanna go.

256
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,852
We need to go because
your dad is hurting you.

257
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:12,731
And your mom is trying to
stop him, but she can't.

258
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:16,328
He's gonna keep hurting you
unless you leave with us.

259
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:20,292
That's the only way anyone is gonna
stop him. Do you understand me?

260
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,887
Your daughter's not with
any of the departments.

261
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:26,124
- Then where is she?
- I'm trying to figure that out.

262
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:30,843
- Did you see anyone near her room?
- No! Call security! Find me my daughter!

263
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:34,608
Megan, I need you to
breathe and calm down

264
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:37,890
and stop crying, so we can leave now. OK?

265
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,087
Come on.

266
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,687
I miss my mom. I want my mom!

267
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,091
I know. Come on with me. I know.

268
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:58,849
Look out for a nine-year-old girl
with blonde hair, striped top and blue jeans.

269
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:01,606
I've got Third Street, west door covered.

270
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,164
In there.

271
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:34,803
Just got a team on the ground in Visalia,
and more coming in from Fresno.

272
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:38,806
Division's loaned us some men,
so I'm sending Miller along with you.

273
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,611
I can handle her myself.

274
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:43,253
That's not what I'm worried about.

275
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:49,970
Do you think I'd sentence millions to death
just for the satisfaction of killing her?

276
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,524
I'll do my job.

277
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:59,208
I'm just sending Miller along
to make sure of that.

278
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:29,288
You should go be with your family.

279
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:32,171
You should get on a plane.

280
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,685
- I'll call you when we're in the air.
- Yeah. Good.

281
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:43,849
David...

282
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:47,130
How did you find out about
the military evacuation?

283
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,805
I made some phone calls.

284
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:52,602
Just following up on a rumour.
I can't tell you any more than that.

285
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:56,686
You will tell me more,
and I will not ask you again.

286
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:02,208
I am not a member of your staff, David.
I am your wife.

287
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:06,366
Ex-wife, and you will tell me because
the safety and security of this country

288
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:08,967
is more important than your power plays.

289
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:13,171
You know, despite everything
that's happened, I love you.

290
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:15,642
- Oh, please.
- No, I always will.

291
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:21,808
Whether you believe it or not, everything that
I have done has been in your best interest.

292
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:26,964
If you won't give me
a second chance at your heart,

293
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,011
let me help in the ways you know I can.

294
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:36,089
And I can't help you, David, unless you
give me some idea of what you’re facing.

295
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:41,963
I was able to find something
your own staff couldn't find.

296
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:46,843
I didn't have to warn you.
I came here on my own accord.

297
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:55,768
Terrorists have planned
a strike against Los Angeles.

298
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:58,003
NSA thinks it'll be today.

299
00:26:58,093 --> 00:27:00,561
What kind of strike?

300
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,644
Nuclear.

301
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,963
Oh, my G...

302
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:07,044
Oh, my God.

303
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,208
Talk to me, Sherry.

304
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,245
Come on.

305
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,643
I got the information about
the military evacuation

306
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,691
from someone inside
the defence department.

307
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,126
Who?

308
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:28,923
A high-level staffer. He's in the loop.
He owed me a favour.

309
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,481
But there's something more important.

310
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:36,408
He also told me that there are members of
your own administration allying against you.

311
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:40,088
They want control of your presidency.

312
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,733
That's why I came here today.

313
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:45,486
Who, Sherry?

314
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:50,522
People who disagree with your policies,
who want to impose their will on the country.

315
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:55,004
There have been deals made under
the table, David. Back-room promises.

316
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:58,369
Now, I can keep digging, find out.

317
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:02,361
If you want my help.

318
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,571
If I accept your help, it won't be about us.

319
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:25,248
It'll be about doing
what's best for the country.

320
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,121
Sweetheart, you can call it
anything you want.

321
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:35,247
I'll get you a secure line
and a private place to make your calls.

322
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:39,121
Then I'll come to you
as soon as I find out more.

323
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:48,049
This had better not be
one of your manipulations.

324
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,328
The stakes are too high.

325
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:14,486
- Dad?
- Hm?

326
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:17,804
- Reza's parents are here.
- I'm on the phone to your grandmother.

327
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:20,885
I'll be right there.

328
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,530
Oh!

329
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,604
You're here!

330
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,562
Welcome.

331
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,687
- So nice to see you, Kate.
- Come on in.

332
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:36,243
Thank you. The house looks beautiful.

333
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,767
Oh, thank you.

334
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:43,244
Well... you must be tired.
Let's go into the living room.

335
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,971
OK.

336
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,093
So, how is everyone holding up?

337
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,164
Not too bad.

338
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,528
Where is Reza?

339
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,844
Um, well, there's a small problem
we're dealing with.

340
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:59,083
What kind of problem?

341
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:05,283
Um, some men from the government
are here talking to him.

342
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:08,244
About?

343
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:13,412
- It's a criminal investigation.
- I don't understand.

344
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:16,849
- It's very complicated.
- Kate, what is going on?

345
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:21,609
- It would be best if Reza told you himself.
- Told us what?

346
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:29,842
They're talking to Reza about his possible
involvement in terrorist activities.

347
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:33,164
- That is absurd!
- This must be a mistake.

348
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:36,325
- That's what they're trying to find out.
- You see?

349
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:40,884
Your country, you talk about tolerance,
you talk about freedom,

350
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,170
but you treat every Middle Easterner
like terrorist!

351
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:48,485
No! No, of course not.
I'm sure it'll all get sorted out.

352
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:52,043
- Rima, Hassan...
- Bob, do you know about this?

353
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:57,810
They just showed up about an hour ago.
I know nothing else. I'm sorry.

354
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:01,368
Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.

355
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,443
Wait for me in the parking lot.

356
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:20,290
If it's more than ten minutes, it means
they caught me, so take off without me.

357
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:25,202
You can't let them.
We are gonna leave all together.

358
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:28,612
OK?

359
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:35,245
Miguel.

360
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:38,764
Thank you.

361
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,887
Are you OK to walk by yourself?

362
00:31:57,973 --> 00:31:59,804
Yeah? Good girl.

363
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:05,171
Hey! Hey!

364
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:09,246
I got a male Hispanic, early 20s,
running out with a computer monitor.

365
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,324
Hey, come on!

366
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:17,806
Shh.

367
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:29,602
Go that way!

368
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,169
So, Ed, how are ya?

369
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,209
Don't bother, Nina.

370
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:34,208
I'm here because I have to be,
not because I'm your friend.

371
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:39,572
You're here because they think, after I help
stop the bomb, Jack will try to kill me.

372
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,803
Which, of course, he will.

373
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,293
And what if you can't stop him?

374
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,409
I mean, no offence,

375
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:51,247
but, Ed, let's face it, you're no match for Jack.

376
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,803
You're just not that ruthless.

377
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:03,292
So he manages to get around you
and pull the trigger. What happens then?

378
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:09,364
Because of the pardon, he knows if he
kills me, he'll spend the rest of his life in jail.

379
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:13,332
Jack, if you have some way to
shut her up I'm not thinking of...

380
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:18,726
Of course, Jack's mind is thinking
"That's not such a bad deal."

381
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:25,532
Small price to pay to avenge his wife's death.

382
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:30,004
But what about his daughter?
Is he thinking about her?

383
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:35,888
She's already lost one parent.
If he kills me, she'll have no one.

384
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:42,532
Jack knows I'm right.

385
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:47,528
He should just use me to stop the bomb,
and then go home to Kim.

386
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:53,651
She needs you, Jack.

387
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:17,929
- I didn't transfer that money.
- You transferred it into that account.

388
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,207
I didn't!

389
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:22,490
Then you better tell me who did,
or I'm taking you in!

390
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,529
Why are you doing this?

391
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:26,649
Friends of mine...

392
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:32,326
who were doing their best to protect
the citizens of this country

393
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:38,010
were murdered today... probably by
the same people you're funding!

394
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:42,764
That a good enough reason for you?

395
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,844
I told you before...

396
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,331
I don't know anything else.

397
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:10,404
Your parents.

398
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,728
All right, stand up, Reza.

399
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:26,372
Place your hands behind your head.

400
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:35,003
It's a shame. It's gonna break their heart.

401
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,601
I have to walk you right past them.

402
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:42,481
And they're gonna see who their son really is.

403
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,251
Wait!

404
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:55,891
I confirmed the transfers,
but I didn't make them.

405
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:59,124
I was just covering the records.

406
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:03,325
I didn't want him to get into trouble.

407
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:08,402
Who? Who are you covering for?

408
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:16,007
Come on, who transferred that money
into Syed Ali's accounts?

409
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,484
Bob Warner.

410
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:28,964
Marie's father.

411
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,165
What?

412
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,972
- What's the matter?
- I don't feel very well.

413
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:04,884
Come on, Miguel.

414
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:08,564
Get away from us!

415
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,009
Give her to me, or I will make sure
you go to prison for 20 years.

416
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,926
- I know how she got hurt.
- That was an accident!

417
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,605
Like Carla's bruises?

418
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:38,603
- It's OK.
- Miguel...

419
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:47,526
Let's just get outta here.

420
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:52,888
Get his car keys.

421
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,166
- Reza.
- Sweetheart, angel.

422
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:22,691
- You OK?
- Yes.

423
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:27,767
- They know I didn't do anything.
- Oh, thank God.

424
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:32,483
- We can get married today.
- I don't know, sweetheart.

425
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:35,325
Mr Warner.

426
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:38,808
Could you follow me, please, sir?

427
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:43,364
- What does this have to do with me?
- Just come with me, please.

428
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,688
What did you tell them?

429
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:50,923
The truth.

430
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:56,087
- The truth? What do you mean, the truth?
- Please, my parents are very upset.

431
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:10,931
Hurry.

432
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:28,051
Yeah.

433
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:30,364
Yeah. OK.

434
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:34,968
The team's in Visalia.
We'll have tactical and field units.

435
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,931
We have confirmation that they're in place?

436
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:40,163
Probably in the air.

437
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:45,611
We'll have air traffic, um...

438
00:40:48,253 --> 00:40:50,209
Air traffic priority?

439
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:53,089
Yeah...

440
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:55,368
Tra...

441
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,249
Jack...

442
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,609
It's all right, Ed. It's all right. Just take it easy.

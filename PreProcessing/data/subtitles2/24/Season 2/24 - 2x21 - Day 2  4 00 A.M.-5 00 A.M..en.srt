1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,611
Jim, we both know that you've been
one of the most outspoken opponents

2
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:20,923
to my decision to call off this attack.

3
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:25,006
If you have something to say, I would
expect you to bring it to me first.

4
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,966
Does the president have
any idea what's going on?

5
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:30,766
- I don't think so.
- Let's keep it that way.

6
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:32,645
Thank you for assembling
at such short notice.

7
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,606
I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've invited you here.

8
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:39,606
It is my sincere belief, based on
his response to today's events,

9
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:44,847
David Palmer is unfit to continue
as President of the United States.

10
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,044
Looks like you've had quite a day.

11
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,249
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I know you didn't.

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,211
We know Gary Matheson killed his wife.
We're looking for him now.

13
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:55,763
So you're off the hook for everything
that happened this morning.

14
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,291
I thought I made myself clear, Tony.
We're past Bauer.

15
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,682
No, sir. You are. I'm not.

16
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,241
Now, if you're not comfortable with
me making my own decisions here,

17
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,289
I suggest you relieve me
of my duties right now.

18
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:08,329
That won't be necessary.

19
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:10,811
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

20
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,453
I just don't have anyone
to take your place right now.

21
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,411
- No!
- Come on, give me that!

22
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,211
- Kate, are you all right?
- Yeah. They've got the chip!

23
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:23,812
All I want is the chip!

24
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:30,484
You come in here, I'm gonna smash
this thing. I'll put it right under my foot!

25
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,372
- Tell me who I'm speaking to.
- It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:44,082
We got something your girlfriend
was about to pay us for.

27
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:45,162
Listen to me.

28
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:49,326
Five hours ago, a nuclear bomb
went off. I'm sure you know.

29
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:53,645
The chip will show who's responsible.
It's vital to our investigation.

30
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:58,648
The man you assaulted was an agent
bringing the chip to my office.

31
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,366
Give me the chip back,
and I'll let you walk, no questions.

32
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,444
- You're setting us up.
- Get back.

33
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,366
What are you doing? They killed Yusuf.

34
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:12,968
We're about to attack
three innocent countries.

35
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:19,288
I can only stop it with that chip, so I'm
gonna do everything I can to get it back.

36
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:24,163
Please, Kate, I need your help.
Get in touch with CTU. Please!

37
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,489
You have 30 seconds to open that door.

38
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,245
- Give it to him.
- Are you crazy?

39
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,528
This is the only thing
keeping him from killing us.

40
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:32,841
You got 20 seconds!

41
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,606
- We should trust you?
- You don't have a choice.

42
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:37,684
- Give it to him. He's serious!
- So am I.

43
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:40,162
He's gonna kill us if we don't open the door.

44
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:47,930
Against the wall! Now! Where's the chip?

45
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,924
I dropped it.

46
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:52,804
Don't move.

47
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,524
Kate! Kate!

48
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,451
I need wire to tie them up.

49
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,922
- What about the chip?
- I've got it.

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:18,768
Just got this Pentagon briefing stating that
our bombers aren't going back to their bases.

51
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,046
Do you know about this?

52
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:24,603
I understand they're holding,
awaiting refuelling.

53
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:27,002
I ordered them back to their bases.

54
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,847
I know. That's why I'm here.
Could you come with me for a minute?

55
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:35,402
- Come with you where?
- To the main conference room.

56
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:40,002
What's going on, Mike?

57
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:43,802
Please, Mr President, come with me.

58
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,490
You're ordering me
to the conference room?

59
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,724
No, sir, of course not. I'm sorry.

60
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:56,682
I'm... asking. It's very important, sir.

61
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,641
Mike, I'm the President of the United States.

62
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:07,249
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what this is about.

63
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,324
Mr President...

64
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:14,889
it seems there are a number
of people, cabinet members,

65
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:20,570
who question whether you're fit to continue
as chief executive of this country.

66
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,769
And these people are
in my conference room?

67
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:35,050
In a manner of speaking, sir, they are.

68
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,564
Then let's go see them.

69
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,326
Mr President.

70
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:10,491
So now I see why I had such a hard time
reaching you today, Jim.

71
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:14,333
You were busy.

72
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,883
I apologise if this comes
as a surprise, Mr President.

73
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,170
This is a unique situation
in the history of our country,

74
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,642
calling for unique measures.

75
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,043
Let's skip the sound bites
and cut to the chase.

76
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,727
What's going on here?

77
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,885
Mr President, we are invoking
the 25th Amendment.

78
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,969
Who's "we"?

79
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,850
There's a general feeling that
the decisions made today...

80
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,447
Hold on a minute, Mr Vice President.

81
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:51,402
With all due respect, sir,
most of us here are scrambling

82
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,688
just to understand today's events.

83
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:59,291
I think it's way too early to be referring
to a "general feeling" about anything.

84
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,091
Fair enough. For the record,

85
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,563
let me review the relevant portions
of the 25th Amendment.

86
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:09,886
If the vice president and the majority of the
cabinet determine that the president is unable

87
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:13,045
to discharge the powers
and duties of his office,

88
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,649
the vice president shall take office
as acting president. Everyone clear?

89
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,486
The 25th Amendment was
designed for situations

90
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:23,610
where the president is ill or incapacitated.

91
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:27,971
"Unable to discharge the powers
and duties of his office."

92
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,329
The reason for the disability
isn't limited to any cause.

93
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:34,450
The Attorney General agrees
with this interpretation.

94
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,287
And just what exactly is
my supposed disability?

95
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:44,243
It seems clear to me that the stress of
today's events has overwhelmed you.

96
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:48,485
An atomic device has been
detonated on American soil today.

97
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:51,770
We have clear evidence
which countries are responsible,

98
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:56,324
along with details of
the terrorist group they sponsor.

99
00:06:57,613 --> 00:07:03,290
The evidence implicating these countries
is not clear, Mr Prescott. Far from it.

100
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:08,163
The Cyprus audio has been independently
verified by every intelligence group we have.

101
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,642
I have reason to believe they are mistaken.

102
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,123
Because of this lone CTU agent, Jack Bauer?

103
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:20,332
Yes. Mr Bauer believes that
the Cyprus audio is a forgery.

104
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,881
He also believes that he will soon have proof.

105
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:28,411
He's been telling you that for hours,
Mr President. You still don't have proof.

106
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,208
If military strikes do not go ahead,

107
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:38,321
casualties to American soldiers would
increase by tens of thousands of lives.

108
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,210
That analysis is undisputed.

109
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,605
The risk of attacking innocent countries
is unacceptable. We have to be sure.

110
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:48,891
Everybody is sure, Mr President.
Everybody but you.

111
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,043
As it happens, I'm the only who counts.

112
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,610
This meeting is over.

113
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:00,925
Mr President, one way or another,
there will be a vote.

114
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,722
I think that you should be heard
before that vote is taken.

115
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,333
You don't like one of my policy decisions.

116
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:21,771
You do not have the right to reverse that
policy under the pretence that I'm disabled.

117
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:24,890
Mr President, I agree.

118
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:29,205
I intend to show a pattern of erratic
and irrational behaviour on your part

119
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,409
since the start of this crisis.

120
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,405
In that light, your refusal
to authorise military action

121
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,212
is simply another symptom of disability.

122
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:40,126
Listen to me. All of you.

123
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,807
I know you're not in the same room with me.

124
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,892
But you can see and hear me plainly enough.

125
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,964
Take a good look.

126
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,244
Do I seem scared?

127
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,652
Am I breaking into a nervous sweat?

128
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,372
Am I babbling? At a loss for words?

129
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,683
Is my voice shaking?

130
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:11,128
Can any one of you look me in the eye
and tell me I'm disabled?

131
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:21,529
Mr President, the issue is not your
demeanour over the past few minutes,

132
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:25,208
but your actions over the past 20 hours.

133
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:30,287
Mr President, the vice president
has raised serious questions

134
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:33,763
and, in my opinion, it would
be a mistake to ignore them.

135
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:39,325
For my part, I'm confident that if you explain
yourself with your usual candour and clarity,

136
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:44,885
all questions will be resolved
to the satisfaction of everyone here.

137
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:56,684
Mr Prescott, there seems to be a collective
feeling that a discussion is called for.

138
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:00,368
In the interest of putting this
behind us, I'll agree.

139
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:07,729
On one condition:
when it's over, if I'm supported,

140
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:13,041
you tender your resignation as
the vice president of this country.

141
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:21,168
Very well, Mr President. I agree.

142
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,922
I suggest we all take a few minutes
to compose ourselves

143
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:32,086
and get on with the proceeding.

144
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:37,770
Let's not mince words, Mr Secretary.
You mean the trial of David Palmer.

145
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:01,484
All right, the problem is that
they don't correspond. I need them to.

146
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,371
Ryan, could I have a word with you, please?

147
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,444
Give me a minute.

148
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:12,091
I just got a message that the president
called off the military offensive.

149
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,767
- Who told you this?
- Someone at DOJ.

150
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:19,168
- Someone I trust.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

151
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,404
Is it true?

152
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,165
- Yes.
- And you knew about it.

153
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,813
- I did.
- And you didn't tell me.

154
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:30,329
Why keep my people processing
intel on a scrapped operation?

155
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:35,646
Because there's a strong possibility
the White House will reinstate the attack.

156
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,772
It doesn't make sense. Why would
the president reverse his orders twice?

157
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:43,084
Just keep your people on a war footing.

158
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,083
Tony, phones are up.
I got Jack Bauer on line two.

159
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,209
- Where is he?
- Kate's house.

160
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,966
- Why?
- I don't know, but he has the chip.

161
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,248
Conference-call him to my office.

162
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,531
Why are you at Kate's house?
You were supposed to bring that chip here.

163
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:19,889
We ran into some interference.
Yusuf Auda is dead.

164
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,964
- What happened?
- No time to explain.

165
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:25,648
He's the only reason we still got this chip.
I'm trying to read it now.

166
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,452
I tried a flash card adapter,
but it's not working.

167
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:33,288
You may be able to override the reader
function manually. I'll talk you through it.

168
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:39,608
Good. Tony, while she's setting up,
run a background check on Peter Kingsley.

169
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:44,847
It may be an alias. Cross-reference it
with every major player in the oil industry.

170
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,288
- Peter Kingsley. Why?
- I'll explain later.

171
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:50,649
First tell the president that
we've got the evidence he needs.

172
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,248
I told him. I found out he's
called off the military strikes.

173
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,607
Then we've got time.

174
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,083
Not necessarily.
Chappelle said the order may be reversed.

175
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,322
Why?

176
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,052
He didn't get specific,
but something's going on

177
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:06,284
in Washington that
we're not supposed to know about.

178
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,645
- Michelle, are you ready for me?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:15,689
I've asked someone to join us.

180
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,163
Most of you know Ron Wieland.

181
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,768
Ron is a highly respected
national affairs correspondent.

182
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:37,643
He had a very interesting
experience earlier today. Ron?

183
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:43,443
I was covering Mr Palmer's environmental
speech when I began to sense a bigger story.

184
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:48,402
There were rumours of a terrorist attack on
the West Coast, involving a nuclear device.

185
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:53,613
I kept asking questions. Next thing I know,
I was called in to talk to the president.

186
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:59,450
He asked me to keep the story under wraps
until later, then he'd give me an exclusive.

187
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,172
- What did you say?
- That I'd think it over.

188
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:06,644
As I was leaving, a secret service agent
grabbed me and hustled me into a room.

189
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,009
I was kept there under guard
for several hours.

190
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:15,451
Did you feel this was a violation of your
rights as a journalist and an American?

191
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,409
Of course.

192
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:21,408
- Ron, were you harmed or threatened?
- No, sir.

193
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:25,681
Did you understand the reason
for your being detained?

194
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:31,769
I assume it was fear that if word got out
of a nuclear threat, panic would strike.

195
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:37,528
Do you think the lives of thousands
of citizens is less important

196
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:41,925
than a couple of hours of
your First Amendment rights?

197
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,407
No, I don't. But under the Bill of Rights,

198
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:50,486
that decision was mine,
not yours, Mr President.

199
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:56,604
Did you feel that things were out of control
in the Palmer administration?

200
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,763
You're putting words in his mouth.

201
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:03,123
I did sense the president was not in control.

202
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:09,243
I was trying to balance the need for public
safety against Ron Wieland's rights.

203
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,008
I offered Ron a deal, and he turned me down.

204
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:20,807
Nothing was out of control. I might add,
I had legal precedent for my action.

205
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,244
Thank you, Mr Wieland.

206
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:30,922
I'd like to call someone else to testify.
He should be ready in a few moments.

207
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:37,168
Control CX-5, then hit "enter".

208
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:39,765
- Done.
- Anything?

209
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:44,165
I think it's reading it... No, all I'm
getting are numbers and symbols.

210
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:47,404
Take out the chip.
Make sure the leads are exposed.

211
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:57,209
- Damn it!
- What is it?

212
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,363
- The chip is damaged.
- How badly?

213
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:03,366
Part of the microprocessor is gone
and the leads connected to it.

214
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:07,366
Send me any data you have
to run through our retrieval program.

215
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,762
Can you access a complete audio file?

216
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:12,925
If it's on there, I'll find it.

217
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,485
- IT.
- This is Almeida.

218
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:19,122
- Send two guys up here.
- They're all doing MI for Chappelle.

219
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,807
I don't care. I need two IT people now.

220
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:25,169
- Chappelle specifically...
- Just do it. I gotta go.

221
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:26,402
Almeida.

222
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:32,292
Tony, hi, it's Kim. Look, I haven't been
able to reach my dad. Is he available?

223
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:35,843
We're in the middle of something important.
Can he call you back?

224
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,652
Tony, please. It'll just take a minute.

225
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,088
OK. OK, just hold on.

226
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,727
Are you getting it?

227
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:52,965
Yeah, I got it, but you were right -
the data is pretty screwed.

228
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,045
I've assigned two IT people to help Michelle.

229
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,363
We should get through it in 15, 20 minutes.

230
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,490
- OK, good.
- Also, I got Kim on the line for you.

231
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,931
Thank you, Tony.

232
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,887
Kim, I got your dad on the line. Go ahead.

233
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,929
- Dad?
- Sweetheart.

234
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:14,488
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Are you at the sheriffs station?

235
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:19,124
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house
to pack up my things.

236
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:21,204
Glad you're OK.

237
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,089
Me too.

238
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,641
When I thought you were gone, I...

239
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,688
I just miss you, Dad. I miss you so much.

240
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,048
I've missed you too, honey.

241
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,167
I just wanna come home.

242
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,090
You'll be home soon enough, I promise, OK?

243
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,687
OK. Hey, Dad?

244
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,241
- Yeah?
- I love you.

245
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,362
I love you too, baby.

246
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,244
I'll see you soon, OK?

247
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,725
Bye.

248
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,167
You knew about this, didn’t you, Mike?
How long have you known?

249
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:31,404
- That doesn't matter, Mr Palmer.
- It matters to me.

250
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,484
How long?

251
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,483
A couple of hours.

252
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:49,846
You were part of it, weren’t you?

253
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:56,371
When all's said and done...
you were on Prescott's side.

254
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:02,366
No, sir. I'm on your side and always will be.

255
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,122
This could be a good thing.

256
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,967
A chance to correct a mistake
of historic proportion.

257
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:16,969
David, I'm begging you,
reconsider your position on this.

258
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,164
I'm the president, Mike.

259
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:29,567
You don't call me by my first name.

260
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:33,572
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,006
It's transmitting.

262
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,652
Gentlemen, I'm sorry for the delay.

263
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:02,089
The man you're about to see
is not entirely well.

264
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:05,927
In fact, it's taken a great deal of
courage for him to join us at all.

265
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,722
Roger Stanton, head of
the National Security Agency.

266
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:12,088
Roger, thank you for speaking with us.

267
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:16,052
Yes, of course. Sorry if I seem a bit tired.

268
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,569
I was tortured for several hours
at the operations complex,

269
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,770
by order of the President of the United States.

270
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,605
And why were you tortured?

271
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:29,813
Because you thought I knew more than I
was saying about the location of the bomb.

272
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:34,125
As if the head of NSA would withhold
information from the president.

273
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:38,650
You're lying. This may work for a while,
but eventually the truth will come out.

274
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,611
I have nothing to fear
from the truth, Mr President.

275
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:46,767
As briefly as possible, Mr Stanton,
tell us what happened to you today.

276
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:52,291
I arrived at the OC around noon to find
that my assistant director, Eric Rayburn,

277
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,489
had been dismissed by the president.

278
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:57,406
What was the reason given
for Mr Rayburn's firing?

279
00:20:57,493 --> 00:21:02,806
Eric wanted to bring the military into
the equation right away, and the president

280
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:08,923
was reluctant to even contemplate
the use of military action.

281
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:10,162
That's not true.

282
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,882
For the next few hours, I worked
for the president as best I could.

283
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:18,763
He was indecisive, erratic and, as I said,

284
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:24,166
terrified to even think of military engagement.

285
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:29,604
A little after six this evening,
I was arrested on the charge of treason.

286
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:33,610
I was taken to a small windowless room.

287
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:38,289
The president accused me of knowing
more about the bomb than I was telling him.

288
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:42,127
- Was that true?
- No, of course not.

289
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:46,923
In fairness to the president, I think
he genuinely believed it to be true.

290
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,049
Why would he hold such a belief?

291
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:53,686
David Palmer is a decent man.

292
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:57,448
Maybe he's too decent for the times we live in.

293
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:01,211
He wanted to avoid war at any cost.

294
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:05,650
If he could prove to himself that
Americans were behind the bomb,

295
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:11,603
then he'd have a good reason not to use
military force against any foreign country.

296
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:19,803
I just heard you ordered two ITs
onto a retrieval project.

297
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,009
They were working military intel.

298
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,685
Jack Bauer has a chip.

299
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:28,688
It contains an audio file that we expect
will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.

300
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,924
Where is this chip?

301
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:34,322
- It's been damaged.
- Damaged?

302
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,369
The data Jack sent us is messed up.

303
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:39,650
The audio file has to be
reconstituted. That takes time.

304
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,043
- How long?
- However long it takes.

305
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:45,522
It should take about 15 minutes, sir.

306
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,811
Mr Chappelle's office.

307
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:58,283
- Get a message to the vice president.
- Right away, sir.

308
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:25,444
Ready to tell me
everything I need to know?

309
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,924
Continue.

310
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:34,564
We knew about the bomb weeks ago.

311
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:36,644
Enough!

312
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:41,006
This should end this discussion
here and now.

313
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:44,642
Yes, I had Roger Stanton tortured.

314
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:47,930
It was a horrible thing to do.
God knows I hated doing it.

315
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:51,210
But just as I suspected,
he knew about the bomb.

316
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,090
You've just seen that.

317
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,562
When I was strapped to a chair

318
00:23:55,653 --> 00:24:01,205
and thousands of volts of electric current
passed through my body every few seconds,

319
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:06,651
I'm not proud of it, but I dare say I did what
most of you would've done - I cracked.

320
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:11,568
Told the president what he wanted
to hear, that I knew about the bomb.

321
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:15,123
You told me more than that.
You told me about the Coral Snake team.

322
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:20,048
You told me that the bomb was at Norton
Airfield, information that we corroborated.

323
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,886
I don't know what you’re talking about.

324
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:26,170
Mr Prescott, play the rest of the tape.

325
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:29,051
There is no rest of the tape.

326
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,283
- What?
- That's all I have.

327
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:34,763
That can't be. I was in that room
for another ten minutes.

328
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,165
This is all that was transmitted by the OC.
We did ask for everything.

329
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:42,484
There must be a mistake,
or deliberate sabotage.

330
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:46,407
Mr Stanton had a lot more to say
than what you just saw.

331
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:51,089
Mr President, couldn't Agent Simmons
verify what you’ve been telling us?

332
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:54,563
No. I sent him out of the room.

333
00:24:55,053 --> 00:25:00,446
But the fact remains that Roger Stanton
told me about the Coral Snake team

334
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:04,731
and the location of the bomb. Where else
could that information have come from?

335
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:07,964
We have many intelligence
agencies, Mr President,

336
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:10,362
thousands of agents combing the planet.

337
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,809
It could've come from anywhere.
I know it didn't come from me.

338
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,771
That's a lie and you know it. Tell them, Mike.

339
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:24,171
I only know what the president told me.

340
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:27,809
I wasn't in the room.

341
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,565
Mr Stanton, thank you again.

342
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:36,169
You will remain in custody as the president
has ordered until this matter is resolved.

343
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:37,447
I understand.

344
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:43,288
Mr President, if you have any evidence
you'd like to present, please do so now.

345
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:48,891
The testimony that's been presented here
so far is inaccurate and incomplete.

346
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:53,763
Roger Stanton is directly responsible
for placing a nuclear weapon on US soil.

347
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:57,402
I have evidence that proves it,
but you’ve given me no time.

348
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:02,243
While my behaviour may have been extreme,

349
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:06,611
I was just responding to
the extremity of today's events.

350
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:12,962
Make no mistake. If we unleash our military
power on nations that later prove innocent,

351
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:17,046
it will rank as one of the most
despicable sneak attacks in history.

352
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:20,205
Any chance for peace in the Middle East
will vanish forever.

353
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:23,763
Even if it costs American lives in the future,

354
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:27,448
we must delay the attack
until we are certain of our ground.

355
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:28,568
Excuse me.

356
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:33,204
I just received an urgent message
from CTU division chief Ryan Chappelle.

357
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:39,482
Jack Bauer has evidence he claims
will prove the Cyprus audio was forged.

358
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:42,565
Please, everyone... Sh. Please settle down.

359
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:45,372
The evidence is being reviewed at CTU now.

360
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:49,924
Mr Chappelle says that the analysis shall
be complete within the next few minutes.

361
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:54,803
Considering the impact that this evidence
will have on these proceedings,

362
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:58,169
I think it's incumbent upon us to wait.

363
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:05,048
- I'm looking at it right now.
- We can't configure it, either.

364
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:08,523
- Did you run it through default mode?
- The audio files are gone.

365
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,888
They're just some markers that repeat.

366
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:13,533
- Thanks, Jason.
- All right.

367
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,091
He didn't find anything, either.

368
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,408
Well, what have you got?

369
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,961
The chip was more compromised
than we thought.

370
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:27,410
- Do you have the audio file?
- Michelle recovered some information.

371
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,688
It may tell us who programmed it.

372
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,845
Did you find the audio file?
That's all I need to know.

373
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,372
No, we didn't.

374
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,688
So... Bauer wasted our time.

375
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:02,084
Come on.

376
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,204
Kate?

377
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,324
Kate, are you all right?

378
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:27,129
Everything that's happened today,
everything that's still happening...

379
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,324
I keep thinking it's all my fault.

380
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:36,646
Come here. We would never have found
the bomb in time if it wasn't for you.

381
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:40,923
My sister was the one behind the bomb.
She helped those fanatics.

382
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,811
Yes. But you’re not your sister.

383
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:49,081
I should've seen something
was wrong before it got this bad.

384
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:53,371
Because of what she did, it could start a war.

385
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,205
I could've stopped it.

386
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:57,329
No, Kate, you couldn't have.

387
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:01,164
There are things in this world
that are out of our control.

388
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:05,883
Sometimes we blame ourselves for them
so that we can try and make sense out of it.

389
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,524
Come here.

390
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:20,925
There was nothing you could have done.

391
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,089
Sorry. Yeah?

392
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:40,492
It's Tony and Michelle.

393
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:42,723
Excuse me.

394
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,769
- You got the audio file?
- No.

395
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:48,687
What do you mean? Are you saying
there's no audio file on that chip?

396
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:51,207
If there were, they were destroyed.

397
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,602
Chappelle wants you in
on a call to the president.

398
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,490
Yeah, I bet he does.

399
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:59,771
Some of the information Michelle
recovered may be worth looking into.

400
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:00,968
What information?

401
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:03,851
Identical code fragments
in several data streams.

402
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:07,846
- What are the fragments for?
- Nothing. That's the point.

403
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:13,371
It's junk code. Programmers sometimes
embed it into their programs as a signature.

404
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:16,889
Michelle traced the sequence
to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.

405
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,964
He's got a file with the FBI.

406
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:22,648
You think this is the technician
that created the Cyprus audio?

407
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,483
Yes.

408
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:27,168
We can't follow up any more leads,
so you have to talk to this guy.

409
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,130
What's his last known address?

410
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:33,331
210 Laurel Canyon Boulevard,
North Hollywood.

411
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,770
I got it. I'll get back to you.

412
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:37,844
All right.

413
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,643
- I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
- Where?

414
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:48,683
We got something off the chip,
not what we're looking for, but it's a lead.

415
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:55,212
When you're ready, an officer will take you
back to CTU so you can be with your father.

416
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,568
Thanks.

417
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,644
OK.

418
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,049
- Jack?
- Yeah?

419
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:13,083
Be careful.

420
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:16,131
Thanks. I will be.

421
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:29,044
Squadrons have been in a holding pattern
since the president called off the attack.

422
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,964
They just refuelled.

423
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:35,524
If we want to resume the operation,
we need to come to a conclusion now.

424
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:40,767
A few more minutes. This is the difference
between peace and war, Mr Prescott.

425
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:45,131
It's also a pattern that's been recurring
over the last few hours.

426
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:49,809
Everything will change once Mr Bauer calls.
It just never quite happens.

427
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:57,684
- Yes, what?
- CTU.

428
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,806
Jack Bauer and Ryan Chappelle
are on the line.

429
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:07,365
- This is President Palmer.
- This is Ryan Chappelle.

430
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,842
- Hello.
- Jack Bauer is on the line as well.

431
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,401
He'll give you an update.

432
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:17,806
Mr President, I found the chip.
Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged.

433
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:21,044
Can it prove that the Cyprus
recording was forged?

434
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,330
In its present condition, it proves nothing.

435
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,406
- Can it be repaired?
- No, sir. But about an hour ago,

436
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:30,927
I was tortured by men who wanted the chip.

437
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:35,529
They worked for Peter Kingsley.
He's part of the group behind the bomb.

438
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:38,685
They've manipulated
today's events to start this war.

439
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:39,888
What?

440
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,612
To improve their oil contracts
in the Caspian Sea

441
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:46,686
and to control the oil
coming out of the Middle East.

442
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,164
I need something concrete, evidence.

443
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:52,165
I understand. I'm checking up
on an address of a man

444
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:57,611
who we believe engineered the recording
for Kingsley. It's the best we've got.

445
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,809
Everything you've seen,

446
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:04,488
are you absolutely convinced
the Cyprus recording was forged?

447
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,245
Yes, sir, absolutely.

448
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,166
All right, Jack. Thank you.

449
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:22,931
The evidence I was hoping for is not yet
available, but I believe it will be soon.

450
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:27,052
- When, Mr President?
- I don't know.

451
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,967
Meanwhile, the window for
a surprise attack is rapidly closing.

452
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:34,644
It's time to vote.

453
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:38,965
Mr Vice President, if you could
indulge me for one minute.

454
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,804
Mr President.

455
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:46,811
This Bauer thing is an illusion, a mirage.

456
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:49,851
Every time you get near it,
it moves further away.

457
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:55,087
For your sake, for the country's,
authorise the attack.

458
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:57,562
All this will just go away.

459
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:02,443
And a lot of people, Americans and
non-Americans, will die for no reason.

460
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,922
We don't know that, Mr President.

461
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,727
Let's get on with the vote.

462
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:16,923
Members of the cabinet, you've
been presented with the evidence.

463
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,969
You know what's at stake.

464
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:24,685
Those of you who believe the president
is able to continue in office, vote yes.

465
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:28,243
Those of you who believe he isn't, vote no.

466
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,489
Mr Novick will conduct a voice poll.

467
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:34,167
The numbers will be reflected on the screen.

468
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,244
Mr Novick?

469
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:40,961
Ms Secretary of Transportation,
how do you vote?

470
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:42,042
Yes.

471
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:48,729
Mr Secretary of Treasury?

472
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:50,562
No.

473
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:07,684
Yes.

474
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:14,132
- Almeida.
- It's Jack.

475
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:18,968
I'm half a block from Hewitt's loft.
Has the FBI sent over his file yet?

476
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:21,009
- Yeah.
- What do I need to know?

477
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:26,292
The State Department recruited him. He
revamped their entire surveillance program.

478
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:29,968
He got caught manipulating files
that he didn't have clearance for.

479
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:33,204
He tried to kill himself,
spent a year in psychiatric prison,

480
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,090
then was released last September.

481
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:38,802
- No connection to Kingsley?
- No, not that we can find.

482
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:42,161
As soon as I get Hewitt, I'll get back to you.

483
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:45,131
Any word on what's happening
with the president?

484
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:48,523
- No, not yet.
- OK, thanks.

485
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,049
Mr Secretary of Defence, how do you vote?

486
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:57,284
Yes, I believe the president
should stay in office.

487
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:07,444
Mr Secretary of Agriculture.

488
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,412
No.

489
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,361
Mr Secretary of the Interior.

490
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,132
No.

491
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:44,045
Mr Secretary of State, the vote
is seven for and seven against.

492
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:47,842
- Yours is the deciding vote.
- I'm aware of that.

493
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:59,367
I've never met a man that I respected
more than you, Mr President. Never.

494
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:11,370
But we are talking about tens
of thousands of American lives.

495
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,763
I'm compelled to vote no.

496
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,530
Mr President, can you see the results?

497
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:51,568
You will have an opportunity to appeal this
in four days in front of Congress.

498
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:58,286
In the meantime, I must ask you to remove
yourself from the decision-making process.

499
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:01,767
Please take the president to a holding room.

500
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:16,890
Will you please come with us, Mr President?

501
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:43,168
Mr President... I'm not a lawyer, sir,

502
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:46,882
but as far as I can tell,
the Constitution's been followed.

503
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:50,682
I've got no choice but to
ask you to come with us.

504
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:53,684
I'm sorry, sir.

505
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,047
I do solemnly swear that
I will faithfully execute

506
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:22,684
the office of the President of the United
States and will, to the best of my ability,

507
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:27,051
preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States,

508
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,124
so help me God.

509
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,084
Come on.

510
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,404
Alex?

511
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:12,846

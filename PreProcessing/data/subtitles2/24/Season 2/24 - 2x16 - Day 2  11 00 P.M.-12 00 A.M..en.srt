1
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:15,965
I need to speak with the president.

2
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:19,489
They can't diffuse it. We'll have to fly it out.

3
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,529
Ground zero has to be a precise location.

4
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,844
A pilot will have to go down with the plane.
It's a suicide mission.

5
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,845
- Who ended up flying the plane?
- Jack Bauer.

6
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,767
- Get Air Force One ready as soon as possible.
- Do you mind if I ask where you're going?

7
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:33,002
Los Angeles.

8
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,607
- Who's he?
- His name is Yusuf Auda.

9
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:40,813
His government assigned him as a liaison.
They helped us get the hard drive from Ali.

10
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:44,124
It's a recording of a conversation
that took place four months ago.

11
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:47,728
- Conversation between who?
- Ali and high-ranking government officials.

12
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,929
These countries not only
knew about the bomb,

13
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,085
- but they bought it and supplied it to Ali?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:55,971
- Kim?
- Daddy. What's that noise? Where are you?

15
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:59,045
I'm in a plane. We found the bomb.

16
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,887
We needed someone to fly it over the desert,
so when it exploded nobody would get killed.

17
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:06,488
- That someone turned out to be me.
- No, Daddy.

18
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:11,283
I love you more than anything
in the world. Goodbye.

19
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:16,083
- George, what the hell are you doing here?
- Brought something for ya. It's a parachute.

20
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,482
I already told you, I'm taking this plane in.

21
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:23,089
You still got a life, Jack.
What's left but going straight and level

22
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,448
and taking it into a dive? Am I right?

23
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:29,287
- You really think you can do this?
- Jack, I'm supposed to do this.

24
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,444
Oh, Dad.

25
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,404
Agent Bauer.

26
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:54,126
- My orders are to take you back to CTU, sir.
- That's affirmative.

27
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:03,124
Lieutenant, I need you to get ahold of Tony
Almeida over at CTU. Tell him that I made it.

28
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:06,250
He needs to get ahold
of my daughter, tell her I'm alive.

29
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,803
Radio transmissions are a no-go,
and cell sites are down for miles.

30
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,842
- You'll have to wait till we get there.
- Copy.

31
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,849
Would everyone gather around, please?
This will just take a minute.

32
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:28,245
George Mason asked me in advance
to thank you all for your dedication.

33
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:33,805
Thanks to his sacrifice and your hard work,
millions of lives were saved.

34
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,532
And that's a result that we can be proud of.

35
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:40,242
To say that this has been a long day
would be an understatement,

36
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,212
and I know you're all tired,
but this isn't over yet.

37
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:48,445
We still got a lot of work to do.
The Cyprus recording is our primary focus.

38
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:53,687
And that's critical to any military response
that Washington's considering.

39
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,082
So let's get back at it, huh?

40
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,929
Mr Almeida?

41
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,162
I'm supposed to update my office right now.

42
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:11,249
But I've got nothing to report except that
I've been excluded from this investigation.

43
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,042
Look, I'll tell you what I can when I can.

44
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,921
My country permitted your operatives
to raid Ali's apartment

45
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:22,323
on condition that I would be
involved in this investigation.

46
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,529
I understand your frustration, Mr Auda.

47
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:27,571
You can call your office
and tell them anything you like.

48
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,931
But we've got work to do here.
You're simply not authorised to be part of it.

49
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:41,804
- He doesn't look too happy.
- Yeah. Are the audio guys ready?

50
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,929
They're waiting for you. Where's Michelle?

51
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,844
- Interrogating Ali.
- Why?

52
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,403
To see if he can shed any light
on the recording. We have a meeting.

53
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,372
The president's waiting for confirmation on
the recording's authenticity. Take care of it?

54
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:56,172
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

55
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:18,002
This tape was recovered
from the hard drive in your apartment.

56
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:24,089
It's a record of a meeting you had with
these three men on April 5 in Cyprus.

57
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:30,169
They're all high-ranking officials from
three Arab countries, one of them your own.

58
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:36,522
The tape proves you conspired with these
men to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil.

59
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,681
Were there others present
who didn't speak?

60
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:49,412
You'll tell the interrogators in Guantanamo,

61
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:53,930
under much less comfortable
circumstances. I'll ask you one more time.

62
00:07:54,013 --> 00:08:00,361
- Tell me what you want me to say, I'll say it.
- I want the truth.

63
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:04,765
What does the truth matter
when you have this... recording?

64
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:11,244
- Explain what that means.
- I never spoke to any of these men.

65
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,643
Are you denying
that the meeting took place?

66
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:21,124
There was never a meeting.
I was not even in Cyprus in April.

67
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:25,090
- Where were you?
- Berlin.

68
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,405
They'll find out the truth in Guantanamo.

69
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:39,283
Why would I lie about this,
when I told you the truth about the bomb?

70
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:45,126
To protect your country.

71
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:52,527
The bomb was a Second Wave
operation only.

72
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,485
I have never met those men.

73
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:10,211
Agent Gibson, your team has finished
the analysis of the Cyprus recording?

74
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:14,491
- Yes, sir.
- Could you walk us through it, please?

75
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:19,693
We began by obtaining voice samples
for Ali and the three government officials.

76
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:24,642
We deconstructed sound waves
and isolated unique qualities.

77
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,963
The voices on the Cyprus audio

78
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:31,524
are in fact those of Syed Ali and
the three government ministers in question.

79
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,733
The recording could have been created
by putting pieces of conversations together?

80
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:39,964
Yes, but reconstruction
always leaves artefacts,

81
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:44,922
mismatched acoustical signatures or altered
cadences. We found no such artefacts.

82
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:49,165
Is there any chance that it could have been
doctored in a way we couldn't detect?

83
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,528
Anything's theoretically possible.

84
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:53,604
But I can say with absolute certainty

85
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,491
that the finest experts,
using the best equipment,

86
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:59,326
cannot find any evidence
that this recording

87
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:03,531
is anything but a genuine and accurate record
of an actual conversation.

88
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:06,685
A conversation in which these
four men sat in the same room

89
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,049
and conspired to detonate
a nuclear bomb on US soil?

90
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,764
Yes, sir.

91
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,008
I just finished talking with Ali.

92
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:25,881
He claims that he's never even spoken
to any of the men in the recording.

93
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,646
He says it's a complete fabrication,

94
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,521
and that he was in Berlin
on April 5, not Cyprus.

95
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:44,484
- He could be telling the truth.
- He still thinks we killed one of his sons.

96
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:48,566
He's trying to save his family by denying
that his country's behind the nuke.

97
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:53,090
I agree he has a motive to lie, but if there's
any possibility he's telling the truth,

98
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,483
- I think we need to investigate.
- But he's not.

99
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,610
- I mean, it's obvious.
- It's not obvious to me.

100
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:04,369
The evidence versus the word of an attempted
mass murderer? It's clear which wins.

101
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,728
- Carrie.
- And, no offence, Michelle,

102
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,452
but your experience
as an interrogator is limited.

103
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,286
- That's enough.
- I sat three feet away from him,

104
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:16,446
and I believe he is a broken man
without the strength or resolve to lie.

105
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:23,445
I'll tell the president what Ali said when I
call him to pass on Agent Gibson's findings.

106
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:28,243
Now, if we don't have anything else here,
I think we're finished, right? Thank you.

107
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:47,808
CTU managed to detonate the bomb
within a few metres of the coordinates.

108
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:52,250
I'm going over the field report now.
I'm not seeing any casualty estimates.

109
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:57,043
We expect zero direct casualties,
or close to it.

110
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,164
Hmm.

111
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,965
I want to give Bauer's daughter
personal condolences.

112
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:09,726
You won't have to, sir.

113
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,726
Bauer wasn't on the plane
at the time the bomb was detonated.

114
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:18,045
- Do we know how this happened?
- Another man ended up piloting the plane.

115
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,567
We're still getting the details.

116
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,363
Sir? We just got word from CTU.

117
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:29,570
They finished their analysis
of the Cyprus audio.

118
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:34,568
It's real. And we have proof that Syed Ali,
the man behind the bomb,

119
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,690
was given support
from the three different countries.

120
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,765
Here's the transcript of their analysis...

121
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,889
including margins of error.

122
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:46,366
Do we have any reason
to doubt the veracity of this?

123
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:50,685
Ali is denying it,
but I suppose that's to be expected.

124
00:12:55,853 --> 00:13:00,404
- Are the Joint Chiefs ready?
- General Bowden has them on standby.

125
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:10,725
Given the evidence,
we don't have the option of not responding.

126
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,531
I don't see any way around this. Do you?

127
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:26,172
I want to issue a statement
that there was a nuclear weapon,

128
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,323
but there were no casualties.

129
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,529
I will alert the networks, sir.

130
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,487
And contact the Hill.

131
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:38,442
Let them know I'll be calling
for an emergency session of Congress.

132
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:44,167
During which, I'll be asking them
for a formal declaration of war.

133
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:07,923
Chappelle wants to see your report.

134
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,688
I'm ordering more data points.
I need another 15 minutes.

135
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:16,562
Fine.

136
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,924
- You all right?
- Just a little tired, like everyone else.

137
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,322
No, I mean, about before.

138
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,485
- It got tense between you and Carrie.
- I can handle Carrie.

139
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:30,452
You don't have the training
or the experience to read a guy like Ali.

140
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,923
- I shouldn't have put you in that position.
- We should press him.

141
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,527
- They will in Guantanamo.
- It may be too late.

142
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:40,765
We're sending him now. I'm heading over
to make sure the hand-off goes as planned.

143
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:42,844
OK.

144
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,802
General Bowden, my understanding is
it'll take between eight and ten weeks

145
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:56,650
to call up reserve troops and redeploy
forces for a full-scale ground assault.

146
00:14:56,733 --> 00:15:00,692
We have the resources in place
to initiate a rolling start immediately.

147
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,888
Rolling start?

148
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:06,649
Surgical strikes against early-warning
radar and anti-aircraft installations,

149
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,123
followed immediately by bombing
of targets that will degrade

150
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:13,285
their military
and telecommunications capabilities.

151
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:19,084
Can these first strikes be underway by
the time I address the nation this morning?

152
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:24,962
- When are you scheduled to go on the air?
- Six hours from now.

153
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,248
We'll be ready, sir.

154
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,127
Mr President.

155
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:34,842
Gentlemen, ladies, would you hold, please?

156
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:38,481
Deputy Prime Minister Barghouti is calling.

157
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:41,451
It's his second call
since the bomb was detonated.

158
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:45,321
We're well past the point of words.
We're about to invade his country.

159
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:51,602
But he doesn't know that yet. If you don't
take his call, he may read between the lines.

160
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,843
- Mr Deputy Prime Minister.
- Thank you for taking my call.

161
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:13,972
The Prime Minister wanted me to express
his outrage for what has occurred.

162
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:18,285
- Thank you.
- That you found the bomb is truly a miracle.

163
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,967
I'm not sure I believe in miracles, sir.

164
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,011
- My people are good at what they do.
- Indeed they are.

165
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:28,245
I'm sure you're aware that we've arrested
one of your citizens in connection to it.

166
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:34,169
- Syed Ali.
- An outlaw. He has eluded us for years.

167
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,290
Expect our full cooperation
with his punishment.

168
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:40,092
I would expect nothing less.

169
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:45,293
I realise we've had our differences, and
today has been an especially trying day,

170
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:48,012
but we are both fighting the same battle.

171
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:52,052
My government remains dedicated
to the destruction of Second Wave,

172
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:56,172
as well as any other terrorist organisation
that may have been responsible

173
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:58,244
for this atrocity.

174
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,642
That's good to know.

175
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,248
I understand you will be under
a great deal of political pressure

176
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,767
to respond to what has happened.

177
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:09,572
I'm confident that you have
the strength to resist.

178
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:15,444
Don't be concerned about a rush to judgment.
We're merely gathering evidence.

179
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:20,288
- I appreciate your candour, Mr President.
- And I appreciate your solidarity.

180
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,490
- Of course.
- You'll hear from me soon.

181
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,688
Come on, let's go.

182
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:58,928
- Hey, Jack. I'm glad you're OK.
- Thanks.

183
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,846
I'll get out of your way.
How can I get ahold of Kim?

184
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:06,404
I spoke to a Sergeant Griggs
with the San Jose Sheriffs Department.

185
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:11,328
He sent a man to your sister-in-law's
to meet Kim. That's his number.

186
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:14,052
OK, thanks.

187
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:19,605
- George told me he put you in charge.
- Yeah. How about that, huh?

188
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,526
Trial by fire, right?

189
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:26,765
- You're gonna do great.
- Look, we'll catch up later, all right?

190
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,844
Yeah.

191
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,089
- Sheriff's Department.
- Is Griggs there?

192
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,164
- I can help.
- I need to speak with him.

193
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,847
- He's not here.
- Is this not his personal line?

194
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,049
- What is this regarding?
- I'm Jack Bauer.

195
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,682
- It's regarding my daughter.
- Sergeant Griggs isn't available.

196
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,412
If your daughter is in any danger,
let me assist you.

197
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,803
No, she's not in any immediate danger.

198
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:10,090
Listen, ma'am...
Fine, just give me the number.

199
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:13,688
- Same area code, 555-9464.
- OK.

200
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,972
- I'm glad you're OK, Jack.
- Thanks.

201
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:22,444
I know Tony's running things,
and I don't want to speak out of turn, but...

202
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,763
- I don't know who to talk to.
- About what?

203
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:30,052
The president's planning military action
based on a recording from Ali's apartment.

204
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:33,011
It links officials from three
governments to the nuke.

205
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,642
The problem is... Ali claims it was a fake.

206
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,008
- And you believe him.
- I don't know.

207
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,891
We ought to be sure
before we retaliate against them.

208
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,170
That's Tony's call.
I'm trying to get ahold of my daughter.

209
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,892
I understand,
but you’re the one who broke Ali.

210
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:53,525
You can read him better than anyone here.
Please, Jack, before Ali is gone.

211
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:56,332
Only he can prove
whether the recording is real.

212
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,404
Fine, I'll talk to him.

213
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:03,806
See if you can get ahold of this Sergeant
Griggs. Tell him it's regarding my daughter.

214
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,165
- Sheriff's Department.
- This is Michelle Dessler over at CTU.

215
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,609
- I'm looking for Sergeant Griggs.
- Please hold.

216
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,402
There you go.

217
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,484
Bring him out.

218
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:48,329
I just wanna talk to him
before they get him to Guantanamo.

219
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,405
Gentlemen... hold up.

220
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,882
Let me have a word with the prisoner.

221
00:20:55,893 --> 00:21:01,445
I want you to know we didn't
kill your son. We staged it.

222
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:05,446
When you get to Guantanamo,
they'll let you speak with your family.

223
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,406
I need to know something.
The Cyprus recording, is it fake?

224
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:14,527
What I told the woman was true.

225
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,011
Thank you.

226
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:26,130
We got shots fired on the north roof!

227
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:31,726
Get back here. He's dead.
You got a radio on you?

228
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,452
Tell them inside,
Syed Ali has just been shot.

229
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:38,731
We've got a shooter on one
of the southwest roofs. Tell 'em now!

230
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:43,204
This is Primary Escort. We have
a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof.

231
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,486
Would you take care of that for me?

232
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:03,328
- LAPD say the perimeter's set up.
- How'd anybody know we were moving him?

233
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:06,962
Intelligence knew we had him.
The leak could have come from anywhere.

234
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:10,523
Shooter's gotta be connected
to a country implicated on the recording.

235
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:14,162
- Maybe.
- They had the most to lose by Ali talking.

236
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:19,407
- Who else would it have been?
- Ali might have been telling the truth.

237
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:22,212
- You talked to Michelle.
- No, I talked to Ali.

238
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:25,808
- Captain Raskind from LAPD for you.
- One minute, please.

239
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:29,681
You're taking Syed Ali's word
over every expert we have?

240
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,207
Tony, Ali was killed for a reason.

241
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,729
Find out if it was cos he could prove
the recording was fabricated.

242
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,566
- Our best people have verified it.
- Fine.

243
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:42,441
- Keep the door open, assign men to it.
- I don't have any men to spare.

244
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:46,412
We're processing intel from nine countries,
and I think this is a dead end.

245
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:49,883
- Captain Raskind wants to know...
- Could you give me a minute?

246
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:52,089
Thank you.

247
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:56,371
Tony, the president is gonna make
some very, very serious decisions

248
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:59,650
based on the information
that he got from that recording.

249
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,770
If it's not genuine,
you have a responsibility...

250
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,447
You're gonna lecture me on responsibility?

251
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:11,005
We both know how you work. You consider
going against the grain some kind of a virtue.

252
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:15,484
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- I got a job to do, I don't wanna be told how.

253
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:18,451
I'm just trying to help.

254
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,127
I don't need your help, Jack.

255
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:25,092
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate
everything you've done for us today.

256
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:31,009
But I think it's time you go get your daughter,
let us handle the rest of this.

257
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,731
Yeah, fine.

258
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:41,849
- Thanks. Yeah.
- Mr Almeida...

259
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:15,046
All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again.

260
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,249
Some kind of problem?

261
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:21,368
Can I just use the bathroom?

262
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,921
- Please, I'll be quick.
- All right, come on.

263
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,127
In the back, on your left. Watch your step.

264
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:51,492
Casualty estimates for the initial air campaign
are minimal. A dozen at most.

265
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,690
- And the ground campaign?
- There are numerous scenarios,

266
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:57,048
depending on how long the campaign lasts,

267
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:00,921
if chemical or biological weapons
are deployed against our troops.

268
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:03,288
Which, frankly, I think they will be.

269
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:08,446
OK, take that all into account,
then give me a number, General.

270
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:14,686
A simultaneous ground assault against
the three countries, which lasts five weeks,

271
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:19,244
will result in ten to thirty thousand
American casualties.

272
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:30,202
And if China and Russia
enter the conflict against us?

273
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,842
There's no upper limit
to that number, Mr President.

274
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:39,451
But it's unlikely. They'll want to insinuate
themselves into control of the oil fields.

275
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:43,572
- Yes.
- I have Jack Bauer. It's an emergency.

276
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:47,771
One moment.
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.

277
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,766
Excuse me again.

278
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,928
It's good to hear your voice,
but I'm in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

279
00:25:58,013 --> 00:26:00,891
I felt this was important enough
to interrupt you.

280
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,203
Syed Ali has just been assassinated.

281
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:06,524
CTU was transferring him over
to Guantanamo when it happened.

282
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:09,764
- What are you talking about? By whom?
- We don't know yet, sir.

283
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:13,289
I think it has to do with the conversation
recorded in Cyprus.

284
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,126
Mr President, I don't believe it's genuine.

285
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:21,241
- That recording was authenticated.
- Sir, authentication is never 100 per cent.

286
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,005
Do you have evidence?

287
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:26,768
Ali said he was in Berlin
when the conversation took place.

288
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:31,563
- He said the recording was fabricated.
- OK, I'm aware of his denials.

289
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:35,168
Mr President, I'm worried that
someone is trying to manipulate you

290
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:39,166
into taking the kind of military action
I assume you're about to take.

291
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:45,442
Look, the fact that Syed Ali was killed does
not prove that the recording was fabricated.

292
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:48,605
No, sir. I know that. I know it doesn't.

293
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,282
But I feel a responsibility to tell you
I believe he was assassinated

294
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:56,285
because he was in fact telling the truth.

295
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,288
Do you have any hard evidence, Jack?

296
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:02,365
Aside from Ali's denials, no, sir.
Nothing concrete.

297
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:08,449
Listen to me. I don't wanna initiate a military
action based on erroneous information.

298
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:13,049
- But I can't stop it based on conjecture.
- I understand, sir, I do.

299
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,691
If I were to get you proof,
how much time would I have?

300
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,526
Our military response
is only hours away, Jack.

301
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:26,249
- You better do it soon.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr President.

302
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:42,208
We don't have any updates. As soon
as we do, we'll patch them through to you.

303
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:47,243
- This is Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Jack.

304
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,325
I want you to keep this
information between us, OK?

305
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:55,328
I talked to the president. He will not halt
any military action unless we provide proof.

306
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:57,404
Ali was our only proof.

307
00:27:57,493 --> 00:28:01,202
There's gotta be another way
to establish Ali's presence at that time.

308
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,126
Other foreign agencies
must have been tracking him.

309
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:08,570
- An official from a target country is here.
- What? Here at CTU? Why?

310
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,769
We struck an agreement earlier today.

311
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:13,811
He's the one who escorted
evidence from Ali's apartment.

312
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,009
- Think he knows something?
- He might.

313
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,608
Tony doesn't want him talking to anyone.

314
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:23,606
- OK, fine, what's his name?
- Yusuf Auda. A-U-D-A.

315
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:27,242
I'll pull up his CV and run a background
check. I'll get back to you.

316
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:38,445
- Jack?
- Kate.

317
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:43,491
I didn't think...
I thought you weren't coming back.

318
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,006
I didn't think I was either.

319
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:50,210
- How?
- It's a long story.

320
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:56,403
But everything's OK, right?
They said the bomb was detonated safely.

321
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:59,485
No. Everything's fine. It's gonna be fine.

322
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,133
How are you? Are you OK?

323
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:05,125
Yeah. My dad's still a little shaken up.

324
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,004
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:11,165
- Miss Warner.
- I have to go.

326
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:15,132
- She needs to be debriefed.
- OK. We'll see you in a little while.

327
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:19,647
- I'm really glad you're OK.
- Thanks.

328
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:34,963
The Joint Chiefs are revising down their
material estimate between 10 and 20 per cent.

329
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:41,011
- That's good news, sir.
- None of this is good news, Mike.

330
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:46,125
General Bowden is ready to walk you
through the strategy statement.

331
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:49,285
- I need a few more minutes.
- How long should I tell him?

332
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,967
When I'm ready, Mike.

333
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:03,369
What is it, Mr President?

334
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,171
The telephone conversation with Jack Bauer
keeps playing in my head.

335
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:16,205
I'm worried that we may be moving too fast.

336
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:24,082
Mr President, your ability to analyse
a situation is your strongest asset.

337
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:27,968
But it's also your greatest liability.

338
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:35,929
I don't wanna make a mistake that
our children and their children will pay for.

339
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:38,766
Sir, we have evidence
that's been confirmed

340
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:43,051
by every military and intelligence expert
on the payroll.

341
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,928
Everyone except Jack Bauer.

342
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,368
It's natural for you to be having doubts.

343
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:51,967
I'd be worried if you weren't having doubts.

344
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:58,003
But when the public learns what happened,
they'll want a decisive response.

345
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:00,129
They'll demand it.

346
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:02,773
We're not responding to satisfy bloodlust.

347
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:05,048
No, sir, we're not.

348
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:09,012
We're responding because three countries
colluded with a terrorist group

349
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:11,368
to explode a nuclear bomb on our soil.

350
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,762
- And we have proof.
- What if the proof is a lie?

351
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:17,243
- It isn't.
- Are you sure, Mike?

352
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:21,844
Are you sure?

353
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:32,687
I'll tell General Bowden you'll call...
when you're ready.

354
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:59,325
- Mr Auda, my name is Jack Bauer.
- Don't give me another excuse.

355
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:03,964
I need to ask you a few questions about
the evidence taken from Syed Ali's apartment.

356
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:08,968
How would I know what was found?
You people refuse to include me. Ask them.

357
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:12,932
My colleagues might not be interested
in the same questions that I am.

358
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:17,643
I'm trying to determine whether or not
the evidence could've been compromised.

359
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:21,805
Before I tell you anything,
tell me what you know.

360
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:27,763
Whatever was found, they're keeping it from
me, suggesting it incriminates my country.

361
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:31,084
I'm sorry. You and I are not even
supposed to be talking.

362
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:34,006
You're asking me to help,
offering nothing in return.

363
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:37,608
- I know I'm asking a lot.
- Asking too much.

364
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,851
This is Bauer.

365
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,606
- Hello, Jack.
- Who is this?

366
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:51,926
The only person who can prove Syed Ali was
not in Cyprus in April, meeting Arab leaders.

367
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:56,052
The recording they found, in case
you haven't figured it out, is bogus.

368
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:59,250
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm the one who planted it.

369
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:05,169
- On April 5, I placed it in Ali's apartment.
- And I'm supposed to believe you?

370
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:09,883
You don't have a choice. That's why I killed
Ali, so you'd have to deal with me.

371
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:13,602
- How do I know you killed him?
- I almost had to take you out too.

372
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:17,368
But you moved. I'm dying to know
what you two were talking about.

373
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,365
- What do you want?
- Kate Warner.

374
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:24,847
Why? Why do you want her?

375
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:29,211
Get her out of CTU. Bring her to the
intersection of Meridian and Moorpark.

376
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:32,285
There's a warehouse.
Look for a door under a neon sign.

377
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:36,969
- My access at CTU is limited at best.
- You're resourceful. You'll find a way.

378
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:40,602
- You didn't answer. Why do you want her?
- Don't worry about that now.

379
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:43,207
She hasn't been released.
She's in debriefing.

380
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:46,285
You got 30 minutes.
Bring her to the warehouse.

381
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:49,012
30 minutes is not enough time.

382
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,605
What's the problem?

383
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:21,606
You'll have a problem
if you don't get out. I'll call the cops.

384
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,730
It's nothing like that!
I just need a few things!

385
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:30,331
Will you lighten up? My wife's pregnant.
Here's some money.

386
00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:32,890
- I'll be quick.
- Keep moving.

387
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:35,646
- You have to help me.
- Sorry, I can't do anything.

388
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,452
- I'll pay you, all right? How much?
- I don't...

389
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:41,093
- Don't walk away!
- Just find another store.

390
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,892
How hard would it be
to open up for one minute?!

391
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:47,443
There's another store ten miles
down the road, west on Route 14.

392
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:51,890
- No, we're going to the mountains!
- I'm closed. I'm not gonna tell you again.

393
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,885
- Don’t you know what's going on?!
- I'm calling the cops.

394
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:59,364
- Look, I have cash. I'll pay you double.
- I already closed out the register.

395
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:04,766
Please, tell him to let me in.
My wife's pregnant. She can't be here.

396
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:09,290
- Look, open the damn door!
- That's it. That is it.

397
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:13,331
- Come on!
- 911?

398
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,563
Some guy's trying to bust into my store.

399
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,087
- Is the store open?
- No, but he's threatening me.

400
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:22,212
- What's your location?
- It's King's Liquor, Soledad Canyon Road.

401
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:24,488
Officers are on their way.

402
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:30,925
They always come out at night.
All kinds of crazy people.

403
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:34,246
- It's starting.
- What?

404
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,085
- Nothing.
- Don't give me that.

405
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:43,325
"It's starting." What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

406
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:54,364
No! Stop it!

407
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,283
Stop!

408
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:05,412
You should have let me in.
I told you to let me in!

409
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:10,804
Let go of him and get up!
I said, let go of him!

410
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,407
Now get out of here!

411
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:17,168
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I'm just trying to get to the mountains.

412
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:19,562
I said, go!

413
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,008
Give me the gun.

414
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:31,922
- I'm not gonna hurt anyone, I promise.
- Just go.

415
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:37,443
Go!

416
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:59,451
- Michelle Dessler.
- Hey, it's me, Jack.

417
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:03,924
- Was Yusuf Auda helpful?
- No, not yet. He's got some trust issues.

418
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:07,044
I'm right behind you.

419
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:11,172
I think there’s another way to prove
that the Cyprus recording was faked.

420
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:14,768
But I'm gonna need your help -
you're gonna have to trust me.

421
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:21,567
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- OK, I'll get back to you in a minute.

422
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:27,929
You should have let me in when I asked you.
My wife is seven months pregnant.

423
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,208
- I didn't want to hurt anyone.
- Just go.

424
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:37,082
After I pay. I told you I had money,
I didn't come here to steal.

425
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:40,404
- I said, I wanna pay!
- All right, all right, all right.

426
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,563
I'm not a criminal.

427
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,612
Turn on the TV.

428
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:51,288
Speculation has continued
to grow around the explosion

429
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:54,888
spotted by two commercial aircraft
and a weather satellite.

430
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,806
While a statement from the president
is forthcoming,

431
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:03,172
one source suggested that the blast could
only have been caused by a nuclear explosion.

432
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:07,246
It's true. My brother works
at a USGS station in Palmdale.

433
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:12,453
- He overheard a scientist talking.
- You knew about this, didn’t you?

434
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:29,484
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Hey, leave her alone!

435
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,809
Give me the gun.

436
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,088
No.

437
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:39,132
Put the gun down
and come out with your hands up.

438
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:42,728
I said, put the gun down
and come out with your hands up.

439
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,006
How long did the two men talk?

440
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,084
Just for a few minutes at a time.

441
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:57,529
And it was mostly in Arabic,
which I understand a little bit.

442
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,604
They didn't seem...

443
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:03,288
too much in a hurry about anything.

444
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:05,648
Do you think that they knew each other well?

445
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:10,363
- Yeah, like they were partners.
- Baker?

446
00:39:10,453 --> 00:39:13,047
- Yeah.
- You did the Macauley interview last week?

447
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,327
I did.

448
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:17,928
A page is missing from the transcript.
Have a copy of the original?

449
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:23,167
- Yeah, but I have another hour here.
- Can't wait. Division wants it right now.

450
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:27,932
- I'm glad I double-checked before it got sent.
- Sorry, I'll be right back.

451
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:30,004
OK.

452
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:41,444
I need you to come with me now.

453
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:44,525
I'm still with Baker,
then I have to deal with my father.

454
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,922
- This is urgent.
- What's going on?

455
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:49,004
You said everything was fine.

456
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:51,846
It's not. I'll explain in the car.

457
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,048
- Almeida.
- Yeah, it's Carrie.

458
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:08,966
- What's up?
- Unless I'm misreading the situation,

459
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:13,843
- Jack is trying to remove Kate from CTU.
- I'll be right down.

460
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,163
Oh, God!

461
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:23,132
- Come on.
- I didn't mean to! He came at me!

462
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:27,650
Please don't let him die!
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen!

463
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:32,090
It was a mistake!
I was just trying to protect my wife.

464
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:38,371
- Lower level, space eleven.
- Thanks, Brian. Come on, Kate.

465
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:43,530
- Where the hell you going?
- I don't have time to explain.

466
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:46,173
- Let's find the time.
- What are you doing?

467
00:40:46,253 --> 00:40:50,087
Kate, you stay against the wall.
Tony, put down the gun.

468
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,846
Not till you tell me what you’re doing, Jack.

469
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,962
I'm sorry, I can't.

470
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:04,406
Who do you think you're kidding? You're
not gonna shoot me. Put the gun down.

471
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:07,247
Put the gun down.

472
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,964
Kate, come on, we gotta go.
Now. Let's go.

473
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:16,366
Jack! Jack!

474
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,812

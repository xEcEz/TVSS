1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,485
There's no chance that this bomb
is ever gonna go off

2
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,087
with a Special Ops team
following it every step of the way.

3
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,528
Jack Bauer found
the Coral Snake commandos.

4
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,649
All six members of the team had been killed.

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,531
If there's something
that you haven't told me...

6
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,446
Ask Sherry.
She's the one you wanna talk to.

7
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,207
My father works for the government.

8
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,410
He said someone's gonna detonate
a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.

9
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,131
- I'm gonna show you something.
- What is it?

10
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,248
It's a bomb shelter.

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,289
- It happened.
- The bomb went off?

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,683
The radiation. We gotta get
down below, before it's too late.

13
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,648
- Hello?
- There has been a change of plans.

14
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,927
Why? What's going on?

15
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,767
Marie, our mission depends on you now.
I'm counting on you.

16
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,802
They're a rogue unit,
acting on their own authority.

17
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:04,361
- How do I find them?
- Somewhere at the airport.

18
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,126
Our best bet is still you
getting past them to the bomb.

19
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:09,773
There is a nuclear warhead
somewhere on-site.

20
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,127
There it is! Go, go!

21
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:14,364
Put your hands above your head!
Keep 'em there!

22
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,409
This isn't a bomb.
It's been rigged to look like one.

23
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,245
This is not the bomb. This is a decoy.

24
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,291
I repeat: we are still looking
for the nuclear device.

25
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,727
OK, let's go easy with this.

26
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,652
Go.

27
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:57,966
You have to process the prints here.
Bring in your mobile equipment.

28
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:01,363
You! Where's the real bomb?
Where's the real bomb?

29
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:06,128
Do you understand me?
Do you speak any English?

30
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,852
Do you speak any English?

31
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,527
- Search him. I'll get us a translator.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:14,730
This is Jack Bauer requesting
a translator in hangar 21.

33
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:17,611
I repeat: I am requesting
a translator in hangar 21.

34
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,164
Mr Mason, Jack Bauer is on line two.

35
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:47,447
Good.

36
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,606
- George.
- How's the search going over there, Jack?

37
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,729
Still no new leads on where the bomb is.

38
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,769
What about that plane
you found the decoy in?

39
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:01,244
It's clean. Use reverse-time satellite to
trace the plane to its original location.

40
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,292
That's where they would've loaded
the decoy. Find out who the players are.

41
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:07,250
Here and here.

42
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,406
George? You with me?

43
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:14,891
George, can you hear me?
Are you all right?

44
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:16,042
- Yeah.
- George!

45
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,682
Yeah, I'm on it! Reverse-time satellite. Yeah.

46
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,246
I'm really sorry about everything
that's happened to you today.

47
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,088
But if you can't think clearly, you need
to let someone else take over command.

48
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:32,370
- There isn't anybody else, Jack.
- What about Tony?

49
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,604
I got it together. I can handle it. All right?

50
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,442
Yeah, OK.

51
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,411
- We do have another problem.
- What?

52
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:48,283
The six dead commandos you found,
turns out a seventh may have escaped.

53
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,603
I examined all the gunshot wounds.

54
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:55,084
Three of the commandos knew the shooter -
their wounds were at close range.

55
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:59,086
The others showed signs of a struggle,
which indicates they had time to react.

56
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:03,291
- So the seventh didn't escape.
- Right. He was a shooter.

57
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:08,002
I gotta go. Get me an ID on the seventh
commando as soon as you can.

58
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:09,765
- I'm working on it.
- Good.

59
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:13,528
- What do you got?
- A wallet, no ID, no credit cards.

60
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,012
He wants to talk.
Where the hell is my translator?

61
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,848
Mr Warner, it's your daughter Kate.

62
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,252
- Kate?
- Dad?

63
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,292
- Kate, where are you?
- I'm fine. I'm at an airport.

64
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:38,046
The airport? Are you leaving the city?

65
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,648
Not yet. I'm helping one of
the agents on an investigation.

66
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:45,530
Dad... did they tell you about Reza?

67
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:49,845
Yeah, I... I can't believe
what they're saying about Marie,

68
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:54,165
that she's with these terrorists,
that she killed Reza. I...

69
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,481
I know, Dad.

70
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,564
- Kate...
- Dad, hold on a second.

71
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,804
It wasn't the bomb. We arrested the pilot.
I need you as a translator.

72
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,963
Dad, I'm gonna have to call you back.

73
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,327
Are you OK?

74
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:08,122
Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, I love you.

75
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,601
I love you, too, sweetheart.

76
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:17,442
- What exactly did Roger Stanton tell you?
- Sherry was somehow involved in this.

77
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,845
- The nuclear threat?
- He didn't elaborate.

78
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,924
That's all he said.

79
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:33,852
They said it was urgent.
Is it about the bomb? Have they found it?

80
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,163
Not yet. Sit down.

81
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:42,410
I just spoke with Stanton. He confesses
that he's known about the bomb for weeks.

82
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:46,202
For weeks? Why would he
withhold that from you?

83
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:49,808
He wanted to wait until the bomb was
on US soil before he intercepted it.

84
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:54,648
- So he knows where the bomb is.
- The men he had tracking it did.

85
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,932
But they're all dead. The bomb's still
out there, and we don't know where it is.

86
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:04,006
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

87
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,053
Am I telling you something
you already know?

88
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,607
- What?
- Tell me now.

89
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:19,524
Have you done the unthinkable and put
yourself in league with Roger Stanton?

90
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,889
That's outrageous! Of course not!
What did he say?

91
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,122
Sit down.

92
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,965
- David...
- Sit down!

93
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,972
He said you were involved,
working against me.

94
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:35,490
He's lying, David! I never even met
Roger Stanton until this afternoon!

95
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,643
- That's not true.
- He's playing you!

96
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,372
Whatever he's doing,
he wants you to believe I...

97
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,444
Just stop it!

98
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:52,410
Sherry... right now we are
teetering on the brink of a war

99
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,451
that will lead to the deaths
of millions of people.

100
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:01,210
We have to stop this disaster today,
right now, before it begins.

101
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:06,682
If there is something you're not telling me,
anything that could help us find this bomb,

102
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:09,651
as President of the United States,
I order you...

103
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:13,851
No, as someone that you claim you love...

104
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:21,449
I'm asking: help me, Sherry.

105
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:34,127
I got a phone call... a few months ago
in the middle of the night

106
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:39,162
from a friend of mine who's high up in NSA.

107
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,003
He told me that Roger Stanton wanted
to speak to me first thing in the morning,

108
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:50,929
and so we met at a park in Virginia.

109
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,404
What did he want?

110
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:58,769
- He wanted to recruit me.
- To do what?

111
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:06,693
He wanted to know who was loyal
to you and who could be turned.

112
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:11,847
He wanted... He wanted to
know where you were weak.

113
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,682
And you told him?

114
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,523
Yes.

115
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:28,329
But I only did it to gain his confidence.

116
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:34,409
I was not aligning myself with him.
I was doing it for you.

117
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:41,253
David, I know you don't believe me,
but just give me 30 minutes

118
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,291
to prove to you that I'm telling the truth,

119
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,922
that I did all of this to protect you,

120
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,245
not to hurt you.

121
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:01,050
I think he's saying he did it for his family.
They promised him money.

122
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,124
Ask him who "they" is.

123
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,281
Syed Ali.

124
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,926
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.

125
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,242
Eh?

126
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,008
I don't think that was right.
I think we have different dialects.

127
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,402
It doesn't matter. Just keep trying.

128
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:44,446
Jack, the translator's here.

129
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,966
Jack Bauer.

130
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,283
The subject's there. Kate?

131
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:55,083
- I'm really sorry, Jack.
- You did great. You did great.

132
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:59,371
Agent Baker will take you back to
the controlled area. I'll be there soon.

133
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,250
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb.

134
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,453
He said he doesn't know anything.

135
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,931
ID, please. Can I see your ID?

136
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,964
Who are those people over there?

137
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,285
They're locking down the airport, checking
everyone. Excuse me for one second.

138
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,645
Ask him where he went to school
and the name of his sponsor.

139
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,530
I can't believe the bomb went off.
What did you hear? How many people?

140
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:22,925
I don't know.
The transmission just went dead.

141
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,247
Are you gonna be OK?

142
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,608
My dad, I need to get in touch with my dad.

143
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:34,006
We will. But for right now, we have
to stay down here, where it's safe.

144
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:38,052
We have no idea which way
that radiation cloud is gonna travel.

145
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:43,722
I'll see if I can pick something up
on the short-wave radio, OK?

146
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:07,411
...LA's favourite all-talk radio
all the time, 24-7.

147
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,452
The school voucher debate is really
beginning to heat up again here...

148
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,165
What did they say?

149
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:21,723
The radiation is interfering with the antenna.

150
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:26,284
It could be hours before
we're able to pick up anything.

151
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,732
What's gonna happen to us?

152
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,966
- Shh, it's OK.
- I'm scared.

153
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,886
Don't be scared.
You got nothing to be scared of.

154
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:52,329
We're safe down here. I promise.

155
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,447
You must be the new assistant Division sent.

156
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,922
Carrie Turner. You must be George Mason.

157
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,248
Excuse me...

158
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,924
You look worse than I expected.

159
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,930
- Is there something I can help you with?
- No, I'm set.

160
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,607
I've been following everything from Division.

161
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,411
I'll be taking over from Paula,

162
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:31,372
so if there's anything you need
the server to do, I'll make it happen.

163
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,684
Good. The situation reports
have changed in the past hour,

164
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,810
so you have to refresh
all the computer monitors.

165
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:41,442
No problem. Just make sure everyone
keeps their hands off my system.

166
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,808
OK.

167
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:49,604
Mr Mason... who do I report to... directly?

168
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,882
You report to me.

169
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:58,206
No offence, Mr Mason, but rumour has it
you're not gonna be around much longer.

170
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:02,123
So... who do I report to?

171
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:08,249
I finally get someone around here who I like,
and I'm not gonna be around to enjoy it.

172
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,085
Tony Almeida.

173
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:14,209
And Michelle D-Dessler.

174
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,051
- Did you say Michelle Dessler?
- Yes, I did. Why?

175
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:23,002
We worked together at District.
I was her boss then.

176
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:27,125
And you're telling me this why?

177
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:30,523
It'll be fine. It's not important.

178
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,322
Mr Mason?

179
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,803
My God. Mr Mason? Mr Mason!

180
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,566
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:47,443
- Picture ID?
- Thank you for your cooperation.

182
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:51,526
We will try to get you out of here
as quickly as we can.

183
00:14:56,413 --> 00:15:00,372
Arms straight out.
Just stand perfectly still.

184
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:05,322
Prepare to give the scanners any
metal objects in your pockets beforehand.

185
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,485
It will speed the process through the line.

186
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:14,330
- Marie!
- No need to be concerned.

187
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,564
Please just cooperate. We appreciate it.

188
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:20,292
- Whoa, excuse me. You can't go there.
- What?

189
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,648
Everyone is searched before they're let go.

190
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,452
- It's my sister. It's important.
- Sorry.

191
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:30,090
Wait, here. I'm with Jack Bauer, CTU.

192
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,968
- OK. Go on.
- Thanks.

193
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:37,523
Could you get in touch with Jack Bauer?
Tell him Marie Warner is here.

194
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,569
He'll understand.

195
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:42,929
Dispatch, we need to locate
a Jack Bauer with CTU.

196
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,890
Copy that.

197
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,762
- Marie.
- I need your badge, Kate.

198
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,730
Where've you been?

199
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,485
- Give me your badge.
- Marie...

200
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:26,133
Shut up. You stupid idiot.

201
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:29,091
Why did you have to start snooping around?

202
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:30,242
What's going on?

203
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,451
You have always treated me like
I was some helpless injured animal.

204
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,525
Like I couldn't get by
without you looking over me.

205
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,649
What happened to you?

206
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,286
I opened my eyes.
That's what happened to me.

207
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:48,083
I was pathetic, just like you.
Until I met Syed.

208
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,848
Until I saw the lies and hypocrisy
of my life, of this country,

209
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:55,767
of people like Dad, who help the
government. He works for the CIA.

210
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,002
I know. So what?

211
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:01,086
So what? Do you have any idea the
suffering they cause around the world?

212
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:04,529
Oh, please. What are you, six years old?

213
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:09,164
You think Dad is the enemy now?
I can't believe how ungrateful you are.

214
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,361
I should be grateful?

215
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:16,971
Yeah, absolutely. Dad and I turned our lives
upside down for you after Mom died.

216
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:22,525
This is what we did it for? So you could
be brainwashed by some lunatic?

217
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:27,084
Wake up! You're about to become
the biggest murderer in American history!

218
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,727
- What are you gonna do?
- Give me your badge.

219
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,447
No.

220
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,005
Fine.

221
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:51,285
Marie, listen to me.
There's a nuclear bomb in the city.

222
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:57,402
No matter what you believe, you don't
want all those innocent people to die.

223
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,288
Give me the badge.

224
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,410
No. I don't believe you'd shoot me.

225
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:09,283
I will... because this is
more important than your life.

226
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,083
Or my life.

227
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,724
Kate, stay down!

228
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,844
- Stay down!
- My arm!

229
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,082
Secure the weapon!

230
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,050
- You all right?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,764
I take it that's your sister.

232
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,928
At least give her something for the pain.

233
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:05,528
- I will when she tells us what she knows.
- You can't let her suffer.

234
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:09,162
You're gonna have to let me do this
my way. You have to trust me.

235
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,005
I know you love her.

236
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:14,483
But I have to worry about
the millions of lives at stake.

237
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,531
She is the only person
who knows where this bomb is.

238
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:21,049
I need to use every advantage I've got
to find it and stop it.

239
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,567
Surely you understand that.

240
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,608
Just let me do this.

241
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,684
Give me your arm.

242
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:03,085
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb.

243
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:06,802
You can go to hell, you bastard.
I'm not telling you anything.

244
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:20,851
You wanna know why the pain's so severe?

245
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:24,164
The bullet's still in your arm,
lodged against the bone.

246
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:32,450
Tell me where the bomb is, and I'll get you
something for the pain and treat your arm.

247
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,853
Please, Marie, just talk to me.
Just talk to me. Tell me where the bomb is.

248
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,127
No!

249
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,643
I know you think what you’re doing now
will further your cause.

250
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,725
Deep down, I don't think
you wanna go through with it.

251
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:03,488
I don't think you can justify killing
millions of innocent civilians.

252
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:06,565
Nobody's innocent in this country.

253
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:10,684
I'm not afraid to die.

254
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:24,092
I don't believe you. I've seen
people who are willing to die.

255
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:28,803
I've looked them straight in the eye,
just like right now.

256
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,284
You're not one of them.

257
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,530
I wanna give you a painkiller,
but you must help me first.

258
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:37,888
Please tell me where the bomb is.

259
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,725
Where's the bomb?

260
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:00,884
I'm gonna check the radio.

261
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,091
Do you have any sugar?

262
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:11,166
Yeah, yeah, it's in the back corner,
on the shelf there.

263
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,802
Is the TV hooked up to the same antenna?

264
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,561
Everyone can take out their golf clubs...

265
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,326
...delivery is... Swung on.

266
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:38,325
...prominent civic leaders
and Hollywood stars...

267
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:41,803
...record numbers today gathered at beaches

268
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,885
to celebrate the beautiful
weather of California,

269
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:48,409
which will continue throughout the weekend.

270
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,404
Still nothing.

271
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,283
- This is our man?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,125
Seventh commando.

273
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:12,967
Captain Jonathan Wallace.
Led a sniper unit in the Gulf War,

274
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,248
led an assassination detail in Malaysia.

275
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,324
- Have you got this to Jack?
- I'm on it.

276
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:20,405
Start up a shared volume with OC on this guy.

277
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,524
Hello, Michelle.

278
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:36,247
- Carrie, what are you doing here?
- Division sent me over to replace Paula.

279
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,485
Right. Do you need help getting into any
of the locked volumes on the network?

280
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:45,124
No, actually. I'm all up and running.
You look great, by the way.

281
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:47,522
- Stop it, Carrie.
- Stop what?

282
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,807
You're not my boss today, all right?

283
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:55,806
If you're here to replace Paula,
then technically you work for me.

284
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,203
Fine. Give me an order.

285
00:24:03,413 --> 00:24:08,089
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.
We've been charged with finding it.

286
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:11,483
So why don’t you start by analysing these?

287
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,046
Fine.

288
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:33,407
- Tony, do you have a second?
- Sure.

289
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,604
What is it?

290
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:41,528
I think it's time I step down.
I'm not feeling so hot here.

291
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:46,402
- Is there anything I can do?
- Actually, yeah.

292
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:50,566
Tomorrow, when this is all over,
say goodbye to everybody for me

293
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,850
and let them know what an honour
it was working with them

294
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:57,846
and what a great job I think
they all did, everybody.

295
00:24:58,493 --> 00:24:59,608
Sure.

296
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,845
This morning when I told you
I couldn't wait to get out of here...

297
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,003
I don't feel that way any more.

298
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,686
- Here you go.
- What's this?

299
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:16,165
Access codes for the CTU and Division.

300
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:22,087
I can't take this, George. Only the CTU
director is allowed that kind of access.

301
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:25,051
You're the new CTU director, Tony.

302
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,887
You can't promote me, George.
Only Chappelle can do that.

303
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:32,363
I just talked to Chappelle.
You're the new guy.

304
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:39,651
Listen, George... I'm sorry, I...

305
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:42,372
Hey, don't.

306
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,004
Good luck.

307
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,330
I'll be operating from up here,

308
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:26,405
so I'll need my access codes
piped into the system.

309
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,563
Got it. Everyone's ready.

310
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,644
Good. Thanks.

311
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,962
In case you haven't heard,

312
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:52,569
George Mason was exposed to a lethal
dose of plutonium this morning.

313
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,723
I'm afraid he hasn't got much time.

314
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,888
He just left the office and won't come back,

315
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:02,251
which means that I'll be in charge
until further notice.

316
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,882
Now, on a normal day,
we'd be mourning George,

317
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:09,602
just like we would've
mourned Ivers and Clark

318
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:13,732
and Paula and the rest of our co-workers
who were killed here today.

319
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:17,010
Unfortunately, we have to
hold our thoughts of them

320
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,768
until we can get through this present crisis.

321
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:24,926
So... let's get back to work.

322
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,246
Tony.

323
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:35,532
- It was a nice thing you just did.
- What's going on at the airfield?

324
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:39,652
Jack's still interrogating Marie Warner.
We don't have anything new.

325
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,201
- All right. Keep me posted.
- Sure.

326
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,932
Stay with me, Marie. Stay with me.

327
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:54,005
Steve, walk with me.
Get her Demerol for the pain.

328
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,288
She's going into shock. I need her lucid.

329
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:59,126
- For how long?
- Five minutes should do it.

330
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,564
- Kate.
- Yeah.

331
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:06,367
- What did she say?
- She hasn't said anything yet.

332
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:09,445
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Help? How?

333
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:12,730
You're her sister.
I need you to bring her back to reality.

334
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:15,407
You know her like that. I don't.

335
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:20,362
I thought I did. She's a different person
from the Marie I knew this morning.

336
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:23,092
No, Kate. She's the same girl
you grew up with.

337
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:26,404
She's just regurgitating everything
Syed Ali taught her.

338
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:30,372
I need you to remind her of
the things she used to love.

339
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:33,650
You can do this, Kate. You can get to her.

340
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,727
All right.

341
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:46,768
She's going to be a little groggy
because of the painkiller, OK?

342
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,084
You all right?

343
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:58,491
Yeah.

344
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,447
Hey, Marie.

345
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,288
Hi, Kate.

346
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:19,121
Get away. I don't need you.

347
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:24,891
- Why won’t you help us?
- I am gonna help you.

348
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:29,564
I'm gonna help you stop
being a part of the problem.

349
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:38,525
So it's OK with you if Dad and I died today?

350
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,885
I killed Reza. And I loved him.

351
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:48,771
Why would I care about you and Dad?

352
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:54,965
Because we care for you.
Because we love you.

353
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,128
Why are you doing this?

354
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:06,688
Marie, you could save everyone.

355
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:10,083
You could stop this terrible thing
from happening.

356
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:15,889
I don't want to. I can't.

357
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:19,648
Marie, I'm begging you. Please.

358
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:22,964
No.

359
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,729
My arm... God!

360
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:40,608
Kate, I need you to step back.

361
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,770
That's the Demerol wearing off. Tell me
where the bomb is, and I'll get you more.

362
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:51,723
Please tell me where the bomb is.

363
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:54,008
Marie, just tell him, please.

364
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,926
- Where is the bomb?
- Give her something for the pain.

365
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,573
No, no.

366
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:04,169
Marie, please. Tell me where the bomb is.
Where is the bomb?

367
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:07,370
- Katie, make him stop!
- No, Marie.

368
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:09,728
You make him stop.

369
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:15,890
The pain will get worse.
Just tell me where the bomb is.

370
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:21,208
It's all right. Just tell me where the bomb is.

371
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,089
In the suitcase.

372
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:30,812
Where's the suitcase?

373
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:35,923
- In the van.
- What van?

374
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,288
Where was the van headed?

375
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,488
- Downtown.
- Where downtown?

376
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:43,609
At the Arco Towers.

377
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,730
What kind of van was it?
What colour? What make?

378
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,371
Uh... green. I don't know what make.

379
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:53,650
We're looking for a green van.
The nuke may be inside.

380
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,930
- Send a team down to the Arco.
- When is the bomb set to go off?

381
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:00,733
- Three hours.
- How do you know that?

382
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:03,452
- I saw the timer.
- Describe it.

383
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:07,245
- What?
- The timer. Describe it.

384
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,608
I don't...

385
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:14,652
You're lying to me. A bomb that size
wouldn't have a visual timer.

386
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:21,525
I'm not lying. It's at the Arco Towers.
Send them all downtown now.

387
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:26,243
Why now? What's the hurry? I thought I had
three hours. You told me I had three hours.

388
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,324
No, I'm not lying!

389
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:43,083
Why do you want me and my team
to leave here so fast?

390
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,482
The bomb's still here, isn't it, Marie?

391
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,284
No.

392
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:53,891
Yes, it is.

393
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,568
Teams A and B, do a grid search
on every outbuilding at the airport,

394
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:59,644
starting north, heading south.

395
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:03,362
The bomb is on-site.
I repeat: the bomb is on-site.

396
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:09,731
Oh, Marie.

397
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:14,091
They're not gonna find it in time.

398
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,926
We're all gonna die.

399
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:32,490
I'll sleep on the floor. You can have my bed.

400
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,087
Mr President, your call's ready.

401
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,209
Steve Hillenburg at Langley.

402
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:40,683
Yes, a CIA operative.
He's on an isolated feed.

403
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:45,130
Nobody else knows about this
but the three of you.

404
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:49,047
- Sherry's waiting.
- Good. Thanks.

405
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,525
- Hello, Steve.
- Mr President.

406
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,525
What's your involvement in this?

407
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:09,049
I got a call from Sherry
about four months ago.

408
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,283
She told me Roger Stanton was trying

409
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:15,082
to recruit her in an effort to
undermine your presidency.

410
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:19,963
She wanted an independent source
to confirm that she was doing it to help you.

411
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,806
So you've been building
a case against Stanton

412
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:26,408
for the last four months
without my knowledge.

413
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:29,053
Plausible deniability, sir.

414
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:35,447
What we were doing was illegal,
but... we felt it was necessary.

415
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,884
It could've backfired and landed
Sherry and me in prison.

416
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:42,612
We didn't want this to touch you
if that happened.

417
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:45,924
OK, let's say I accept that.

418
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:49,323
What proof do you have
that exonerates Sherry?

419
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:53,531
I have photographs, taped
conversations, debriefs,

420
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,968
files filled with the work Sherry did.

421
00:34:56,053 --> 00:35:00,251
These meetings that Sherry and Roger had,
where'd they take place?

422
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:03,204
Sherry?

423
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:06,604
Um...

424
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:13,088
For the first month, we met
at a hotel in Hilton Head.

425
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:18,326
- I didn't sleep with him.
- I didn't ask.

426
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:21,166
Thank you. I'll contact you
if I need anything else.

427
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,368
Thank you, sir.

428
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:29,601
You know, I don't care what
you think of me right now.

429
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:34,608
The most important thing is that you
realise that I never, and I mean never,

430
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:36,843
was a part of Stanton's conspiracy.

431
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,447
You know what, Sherry?

432
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:45,003
You might be telling me the truth.
Then again, you might not.

433
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:50,725
Right now, I don't have the time or energy
to figure out whether I can trust you.

434
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:53,247
You have to trust me, David.

435
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:58,930
Your presidency is in jeopardy and
so is this country. Let me help you.

436
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:02,767
No. You'll leave now.

437
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:11,125
David... you need me.

438
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:21,365
If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice
but to place you under arrest.

439
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:29,648
- Yes, sir?
- Please escort Mrs Palmer to her car.

440
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,531
We got a ventilation system in here
and an air supply, but it still stays cold.

441
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:47,969
But don't worry because
we got tons of blankets.

442
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,842
- You tired?
- I'm OK.

443
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:57,969
You're still worried about
your family, aren’t you?

444
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,612
Try not to think about them too much.

445
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,403
You're probably right.

446
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:11,445
- So, did you grow up in LA?
- Yeah.

447
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:15,446
- Oh, yeah? Me too. What part?
- We moved around a lot.

448
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,851
My foot is still hurting.
Do you have any aspirin?

449
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,969
Yeah, yeah, sure. I got tons.

450
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:31,762
You're gonna let me out of here right now.
I know the bomb didn't go off.

451
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,612
- Kim...
- Stay away!

452
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:37,730
OK, it's OK. Just calm down.

453
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:44,213
- I wasn't gonna hurt you.
- Then let me go!

454
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:48,605
- I just wanted some company, that's all.
- Then what are you doing out here?

455
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:52,004
This is where I belong.

456
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,084
I don't.

457
00:37:57,053 --> 00:38:01,888
- I want you to stay.
- I don't wanna stay.

458
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:05,804
Why not?

459
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:10,012
What's wrong with me?
I'm not good enough?

460
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:13,446
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Then why?

461
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:18,892
You think I'm psycho?

462
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:22,170
I don't know if you're psycho.
I don't even know you.

463
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:26,246
Wouldn’t you rather be with
someone who wants to be here?

464
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:30,684
You don't even wanna get to know me?

465
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,803
Please let me out of here, Lonnie.

466
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:40,770
Please.

467
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:12,284
- Here.
- What?

468
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,364
Take it.

469
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:20,687
There's cougars out there. If you see one,
fire a shot in the air and they'll take off.

470
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,129
Turn right out the front door.

471
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:43,162
About 200 yards away, you'll see a deer trail.
That'll lead you to the highway.

472
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,244
Thank you.

473
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:50,365
Kim?

474
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,722
Maybe you'll come back sometime?

475
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,405
I don't think so.

476
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:23,002
Goodrich, what's going on?

477
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:26,332
All agents, one hostile down!

478
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:31,565
Go, go, go!

479
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:34,044
Over here!

480
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,283
Let's go! Bring 'em in!

481
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,847
- What do we got?
- It's nuclear.

482
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:08,173
And there's the trigger. This is it.

483
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:13,281
This is Jack Bauer. We found the bomb.
Initiate a level-one local evac now.

484
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,805
- It's armed.
- How much time have we got?

485
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:31,361
I can't tell. Could be any second.

486
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,806

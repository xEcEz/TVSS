1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,133
Jack Bauer just called
with some new information.

2
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:19,852
He has evidence the
Cyprus recording is counterfeit.

3
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,286
I'm calling off the attack.

4
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:25,889
Stopping and restarting military action could
cost tens of thousands of American lives.

5
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:32,082
An acceptable risk if the alternative is
waging war against three innocent countries.

6
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:35,485
What do you know about Section 4
of the 25th Amendment?

7
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:39,452
If the majority of his Cabinet
feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties,

8
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,569
the president could be removed from office.

9
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:44,213
And the vice president
becomes acting president.

10
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:47,649
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott
who should be charged with treason.

11
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,691
- I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.
- Mike!

12
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:53,606
Until you hear from me,
do not let her out.

13
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,284
I can lure them away from here.
You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.

14
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:01,651
Meet me at Moorpark and Vineland. If I'm not
there in 15 minutes, get it to Tony Almeida.

15
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,883
Yusuf! Behind you!

16
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,612
He's a damn towel head.

17
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:08,649
Stop it!

18
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,926
We got the evidence that proves
the Cyprus audio was forged.

19
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:15,528
It's a memory chip containing
the original source recordings.

20
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:19,092
Do not kill him until he talks.

21
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,607
Jack, I need the chip.

22
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:24,332
It's not for sale. My answer's final.

23
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,928
When Ronnie's finished,
you'll give me another.

24
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:30,004
The chip, Jack.

25
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:33,322
He's dead.

26
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,569
If you are just joining us,

27
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,929
the White House has confirmed
the blast in the Mojave Desert

28
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:53,964
that occurred four hours ago at10.59pm PST
was in fact a nuclear explosion.

29
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:03,126
We'll stitch you up
and get you out of here and on your way.

30
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,330
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for epinephrine.

31
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:08,973
This is a treatment room. I have a patient...

32
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:14,491
- Where's the epinephrine?
- Storage room.

33
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,609
Let's go.

34
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,283
Clear.

35
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,446
Nothing.

36
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,127
Go again. Increase the joules.

37
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,647
You are not gonna die on me,
you son of a bitch.

38
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:35,692
- That's Kingsley. You talk to him.
- Yes?

39
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:38,606
- Let me talk to Stark.
- He's a little busy, sir.

40
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,651
- Did Bauer give you the chip?
- No, sir. Not yet.

41
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,212
What's taking so long?

42
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,124
It's under control.

43
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,125
What am I hearing in your voice?

44
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,681
Answer me, Raymond.

45
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,525
Stark pushed Bauer too far.

46
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:55,081
He's flat-lining.

47
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:57,812
Whatever he broke, he'd better fix.

48
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:01,090
And if Ronnie can't handle it, do it yourself.

49
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,453
- Where's the epinephrine?
- The doctor's got it.

50
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:16,448
- If you don't revive this man, you're dead.
- I need your men to put him on the gurney.

51
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:19,047
Put him up on the gurney.

52
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,601
Give him as much as he can take.

53
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,123
Let's go! Let's go!

54
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,171
What are you waiting for? Do it!

55
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,841
Give him the paddles.

56
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,011
Clear.

57
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,323
Still in v-fib.

58
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,244
Hit him again!

59
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,801
Clear.

60
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:12,089
- It's too late. It's not gonna work.
- Hit him again!

61
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:17,604
Clear.

62
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:22,767
Come on. Come on.

63
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,761
I got a sinus rhythm.

64
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:29,084
I need a Baxter set
and a bag of normal saline.

65
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,133
What did Kingsley say?

66
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:45,727
He said I just got promoted.

67
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:56,252
Hey, Jack.

68
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:04,811
You thought death would save you.
You're not gonna die until I kill you myself.

69
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:07,965
Now, where is that chip?

70
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,442
We'll be convening the Cabinet
within the hour.

71
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,047
Does the president
have any idea what's going on?

72
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,809
- I don't think so.
- It's critical he doesn't find out.

73
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,123
It's not going to be that easy.

74
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,683
Lynne Kresge was about to warn him,
but I was able to intervene.

75
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,764
Where is she now?

76
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:32,242
I had to put her under guard.

77
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,523
I know it's difficult. It's difficult for all of us.

78
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:42,128
- I just hope we're doing the right thing.
- Mike.

79
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:46,491
Do you think these are the circumstances
in which I wish to assume the presidency?

80
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,450
You know me better than that.

81
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,482
This country was attacked,
with a nuclear weapon.

82
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,804
And the president will not commit
to a military response.

83
00:05:56,933 --> 00:06:00,209
I hope you're not wavering yourself.

84
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,887
No. I'm not.

85
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,009
Good.

86
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:09,803
So, your responsibility is to make sure that
the Cabinet votes to remove him from office.

87
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:15,331
I have a responsibility to make sure the vote
takes place, not to manipulate the outcome.

88
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:17,483
Poor choice of words.

89
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,564
But my point is the same.

90
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:24,684
You're doing the right thing, Mike.
History will recognise that.

91
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:38,930
- Anything from Jack Bauer?
- Not that I've heard.

92
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:42,049
Mike...

93
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:46,649
I know you think delaying
a military response is the wrong call.

94
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,089
Only because you're
relying on a single source.

95
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:54,485
Jack Bauer says he has evidence
that we're being manipulated into this war.

96
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:59,363
I have to give him the opportunity
to produce the proof.

97
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:04,402
If there were anything I could say
to make you change your mind...

98
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,484
There isn't.

99
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:08,932
Look, Mike,

100
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,767
I know this is an unpopular decision.

101
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:18,644
And even though you don't agree either,
your standing by me means a great deal.

102
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:23,805
Send Lynne into my office.
She's drafting my statement.

103
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:27,772
- I'll see if I can find her.
- What do you mean?

104
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:33,052
She wasn't feeling well. She took
a few minutes' downtime last I heard.

105
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,249
That's fine. Let her rest.

106
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,450
I'll go over it with Jenny.

107
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:50,211
Please open this door. Whoever you are,
you are conspiring against the US president.

108
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,932
Do you have any idea what that means?

109
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,890
Hello?

110
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,727
You have no idea what's at stake here.
Please open the door!

111
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,081
Hey, get his wallet.

112
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,010
- How much?
- A couple of hundred.

113
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:44,448
- Come on.
- Let's go.

114
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,763
- What's this?
- Let's get out of here.

115
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,287
- Come on!
- Just take it. Let's go.

116
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,527
- Get in the car. I'm driving.
- The chip...

117
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:58,444
Wait. Wait!
You took something from him. It's mine.

118
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:03,323
Why are you with him anyway? Only thing
worse than these bastards is people like you.

119
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:07,645
No. No, no, it's not like that. I just need
that plastic case you took from him.

120
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,291
- This?
- Yeah.

121
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,964
This? What is it?

122
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:19,083
It's got information on it. It's not worth
anything. Please, come on. Give it to me.

123
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,164
What'll you give us for it?

124
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,369
I'll pay you. I've got money.

125
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:26,327
- How much?
- It's not here, it's at my house.

126
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,246
Forget it, Marcus. Let's just go.

127
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,927
- Where's your house?
- Hancock Park.

128
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:35,369
It's not that far from here.

129
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,409
Come on.

130
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,006
Come on.

131
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,290
Yeah, let's do it. Let's go get your money.

132
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:47,286
- First I'm gonna put him out of his misery.
- No. No!

133
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:53,772
- This is for messin' with our country.
- Oh, please!

134
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,811
- No!
- Marcus, man, come on.

135
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,203
Come on, let's go.

136
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:10,045
I'm sorry. All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again later.

137
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:17,050
- Give him more epinephrine.
- He's already had too much.

138
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,488
He's strong. He can handle it.

139
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:34,284
- Now prepare a syringe of beroglide.
- Beroglide? It'll collapse his lungs...

140
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,762
Just do it.

141
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,848
Now, this beroglide stuff, it's amazing.

142
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:56,053
This will paralyse your diaphragm,
and you'll slowly suffocate.

143
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:01,044
You'll feel like you're drowning,
until you tell me where the chip is.

144
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,808
I already told you,
I don't know where the chip is.

145
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,688
Kingsley wants to talk to you.

146
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,923
I'll be right back.

147
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,808
- Help me loosen the rope.
- What?

148
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:24,283
- Help me undo the rope.
- I can't do that.

149
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:30,612
He's on the phone. The other guys are far
away. They'll just think you're working on me.

150
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,969
- Please. This is the only chance we've got.
- He'll kill me.

151
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,647
He's gonna kill you anyway.

152
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:40,408
These men were willing to kill
millions of people earlier tonight.

153
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,724
I am the only chance you've got
to get out of here alive.

154
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,202
We don't have any time. Come on.

155
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:48,204
Do it.

156
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:55,487
Feed it through the bottom. Hurry.

157
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,166
Hurry.

158
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,685
He's coming.

159
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,611
- What are you doing?
- I had to disconnect his IV first.

160
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,161
- Get the beroglide.
- Yes, sir.

161
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,161
Start him off with 2cc.

162
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,686
- Mr Chappelle.
- Hi.

163
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,810
- Is Tony in his office?
- He went to IT. He'll be a minute.

164
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:53,044
- What's the status on the phones?
- Grid's down in most of the city.

165
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,205
- How about wireless?
- Cell service is pretty much out too.

166
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,363
- Are you using Satcom?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:03,004
Save Satcom for your highest priorities. We're
sharing it with half a dozen other agencies.

168
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,685
OK.

169
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,525
Tony.

170
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,205
Hey, Ryan.

171
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,012
Good work.

172
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,890
Good work on what?

173
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:17,012
I know Bauer's trying to change
our position on the Cyprus audio.

174
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:20,369
- That's not exactly true.
- Whatever. You don't have to explain.

175
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:24,002
I'm just glad you're not
letting the tail wag the dog.

176
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,402
Ryan, uh...

177
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,848
Jack may not be wrong about this. He's...

178
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,606
Wait. Wait. I don't wanna hear that.

179
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,090
We're about to bomb
the Middle East into next Wednesday.

180
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,971
We're supposed to be
processing intel to support that.

181
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:42,682
- I've got most of my people on it.
- I want all your people on it.

182
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:48,245
Don’t you think we need to eliminate doubt
about the authenticity of this recording?

183
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,849
Your department has already
authenticated that recording.

184
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,323
Don't make me the bad guy here, Tony.

185
00:14:56,413 --> 00:15:01,203
Mason may have recommended you to direct
CTU, but you’ll need my blessing to stay on.

186
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,569
I assume that's what you want.

187
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,123
What I want is to do
what's right in this situation.

188
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,209
What's right is
to follow the chain of command.

189
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,285
Put everyone on domestic response.

190
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,043
No!

191
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,089
- God damn it!
- Calm down.

192
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:37,963
What do you mean,
you can't get through to him?

193
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:42,683
- Unreachable? I want him now.
- I'll try again, sir.

194
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,525
Aaron?

195
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,126
- Yes, Mr President?
- Close the door, please.

196
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:12,323
- How many presidents have you worked for?
- I came in on Reagan's second term.

197
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:21,091
I haven't been able to establish contact
with my vice president in the last half-hour.

198
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,926
What do you make of that?

199
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:27,801
I wouldn't know how to respond
to that, Mr President.

200
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:34,162
I just pulled our bombers out of the air,
against everyone's recommendations.

201
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,689
Now my vice president
suddenly is unreachable.

202
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:42,085
- Should I draw any conclusions?
- Sir, I'm not qualified to give an opinion...

203
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:45,722
Aaron, you've been doing this nearly 20 years.

204
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,805
You know how the system works.

205
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,930
Is Prescott planning something
behind my back?

206
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,563
- I'm going 20-10, please cover position three.
- Roger that.

207
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:07,321
For what it's worth, I think the choices
you've made today have been the right ones.

208
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:12,123
- That's not what I asked.
- There are always those in the administration

209
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:14,932
who feel that delay is a weakness.

210
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:18,688
- If enough individuals share this view, then...
- Aaron.

211
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,571
Is Prescott coming after me?

212
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:24,763
I'm not sure.

213
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,973
But you have good instincts, sir.
I'd listen to 'em if I were you.

214
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,531
- Thank you, Aaron.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,009
Max is very unhappy.

216
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:59,846
Max can be unhappy.
We're all entitled to our feelings.

217
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:03,642
Peter, spare me your usual
metaphysical observations.

218
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:08,887
Our entire project depends on military action
the president just suspended.

219
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:12,090
- For now.
- Now is all that matters.

220
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:14,926
Now you're being metaphysical.

221
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:15,923
Peter...

222
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:21,041
Palmer won't be able to stand the political
pressure from his own administration,

223
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,567
let alone the will of the people.

224
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:27,362
He's not gonna have any choice
but to respond to the nuclear weapon.

225
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:34,404
You're assuming that this man Bauer
hasn't already delivered proof to his people

226
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:38,122
that the Cyprus audio was false.

227
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,329
Bauer won't be a problem.

228
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:54,769
- Tell me where the chip is, I'll make it stop.
- You'll kill him.

229
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:57,970
No. But he'll wish he'd stayed dead.

230
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:02,050
I'm all done playing games with you.

231
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,408
Now tell me what I wanna know! Tell me!

232
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,850
- They'll hear you upstairs.
- Then shut up and close the door!

233
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:12,803
Fill the syringe and double the dosage.

234
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,088
I'll tell you where the chip is.

235
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,969
Where?

236
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:38,772
Again.

237
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,763
It's in...

238
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,641
It's in a p...

239
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,201
What did you say?

240
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,488
They're taking the chip to...

241
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,246
They're taking it where?

242
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,369
Stay down.

243
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:30,452
How much longer has he got
before he's dead?

244
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:32,922
As long as 15 minutes.

245
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:56,324
You tell me who was on the other end
of that phone, and I'll make it quick.

246
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,171
Peter... Kingsley.

247
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:44,321
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes. Close the door, please.

248
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,404
Have a seat, Mike.

249
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:52,362
I've been feeling a little disconnected
from my people in the last hour.

250
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:57,481
I've been managing the Joint Chiefs and
Homeland Security. If you want me closer...

251
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:00,770
Not you, Mike. Back in Washington.

252
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:04,209
- Who?
- Prescott.

253
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,682
I think he's avoiding me.

254
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:12,205
With what we've gone through
in the last 18 hours,

255
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:15,046
he's just being pulled
in ten different directions.

256
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:19,684
We were, and in some ways still are,
on the brink of war.

257
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:25,211
I'm the commander in chief.
When I call, there's only one direction.

258
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:28,365
Absolutely. I'll get him
on the phone right away.

259
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:31,331
Do that. Oh, and Mike?

260
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:34,644
This statement that Jenny made a pass on,
it's not working.

261
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,566
- What's the problem?
- The facts aren't updated.

262
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:42,647
And I don't think Jenny's been apprised
of everything. I want Lynne to go over it.

263
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,372
Why don’t you give it to me? I'll get it to her.

264
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,444
Thank you.

265
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,048
Prescott.

266
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,364
It's Mike Novick. Can you talk?

267
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:26,011
Yeah.

268
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:29,403
- Are you going forward or not?
- Of course. Nothing's changed.

269
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:33,691
- The sooner you can execute, the better.
- We're going as fast as we can here.

270
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:38,130
David Palmer is not a stupid man.
He knows something is going on.

271
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:41,205
It won't take him long to figure out what it is.

272
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,842
- How does he know?
- For one thing, you haven't returned his calls.

273
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,686
- I'll call him now.
- I think that’s a good idea.

274
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:52,888
Mike, I'm counting on you. You gotta keep
him busy until I can get everyone together.

275
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:56,602
- How much longer?
- A half-hour. 45 minutes tops.

276
00:24:57,093 --> 00:25:00,768
The sooner the better.
I'm all alone out here on this.

277
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:04,084
He's asking about Lynne.
I can't keep up the act much longer.

278
00:25:04,173 --> 00:25:08,132
You won't have to. Just hold your mud, Mike.

279
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,291
- CTU. Dessler.
- It's Jack. I need to speakto Tony.

280
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:28,648
J... Jack?

281
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:34,126
Michelle, I don't know if you can still hear me.
Kate and Yusuf have got the chip.

282
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:40,766
I'm going to Vineland and Moorpark,
just in case they're still waiting for me there.

283
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,083
Michelle?

284
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:44,731
Damn it.

285
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:46,610
Jack?

286
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:57,807
Tony?

287
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,282
- What's up?
- Call just came through from Jack.

288
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:02,091
- What'd he say?
- We lost the signal.

289
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:05,449
- You try him back?
- Yeah. I put an auto-trace on the number.

290
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:09,492
See if Dispatch picked it up in the log.
Find out if it was a cell or land line.

291
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,484
OK.

292
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,564
Yes, sir.

293
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:17,404
What's that all about?

294
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,246
Jack Bauer tried to contact us.
We lost connection.

295
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,450
I said I don't want Bauer
distracting you or your resources.

296
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,922
Whatever he's doing out there is irrelevant.

297
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:30,450
I'm not so sure it is. Jack says he's got proof
that the Cyprus audio was fabricated.

298
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:34,606
- He's bringing it here within the hour.
- If he's got proof, let him produce it.

299
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,083
But I want you
to keep your eye on the ball, Tony.

300
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:48,963
Jim, we both know you've been
one of the most outspoken opponents

301
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,089
to my decision to call off this attack.

302
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:54,927
Any criticisms I may have had
have been expressed behind closed doors,

303
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,083
out of reach of any public scrutiny.

304
00:26:57,173 --> 00:27:01,530
I know we haven't had a chance to talk
one-on-one since all this began.

305
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:06,289
So if you have something
to tell me, go ahead.

306
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,364
There's nothing, sir.

307
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:12,328
My door is always open, Jim.

308
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:16,884
If you have something to say,
I would expect you to bring it to me first.

309
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:20,409
- Of course, Mr President.
- Thanks for getting back to me.

310
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:29,562
- I still don't trust him.
- What do you want me to do?

311
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:32,725
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- What is it?

312
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:36,931
Lynne Kresge is injured.
She fell down some stairs.

313
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:38,844
- What happened?
- We're not sure.

314
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,209
It appears she may have been running
from a fire in an upstairs room.

315
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,205
- Is she OK?
- On-site physician says she's critical.

316
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,284
Show me where.

317
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:18,731
So, what'd you find out from Dispatch?

318
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:25,571
Well, Jack called me from a cell. Came from
somewhere between Encino and Studio City.

319
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:29,532
OK, so he was in an urgent care centre
right around here about two hours ago.

320
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:33,925
- To get to CTU he'd take the 101 or the 5.
- Do you want me to pull up the satellite?

321
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:37,926
No, that would raise a red flag with Chappelle,
which is the last thing I need.

322
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:43,212
What about police channels? If he couldn't
contact us, maybe he tried someone local.

323
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:46,603
Can you monitor those
without being detected?

324
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,204
Yeah.

325
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:53,608
- All right. Focus on the downtown precincts.
- OK.

326
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,405
Yusuf!

327
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:44,972
Jack, they took the chip.

328
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,692
What are you talking about? Where's Kate?

329
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:51,209
They took her to her house. Hancock Park.

330
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,731
She offered to exchange money for the chip.

331
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:58,169
- Come on, let's get you out of here.
- Jack, I'm not gonna make it.

332
00:29:58,253 --> 00:30:03,327
- Go and get the chip, Jack.
- Yusuf, just hang on. Just hang on.

333
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:06,769
Yusuf, come on. Yusuf, hang on!

334
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,244
Yusuf!

335
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,004
Yusuf, I'm sorry.

336
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,081
I'm sorry.

337
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:44,161
All right, let's go.

338
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:46,562
Everybody, be cool.

339
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,411
- You live here?
- Yes.

340
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:53,404
- By yourself?
- Yes.

341
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,290
Damn.

342
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:02,651
I don't have my keys.

343
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,327
- Is this really your house?
- Yes.

344
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:10,205
There's a spare key under the pot.

345
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:20,729
- Get inside. Get in here! Shut it off.
- She's setting us up, man.

346
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:24,283
I said, shut it off. Shut it off!

347
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:27,365
- What's the code?
- 51224.

348
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,921
51224.

349
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:36,692
Show us where the money's at.

350
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:45,284
Doctor, what's her status?

351
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:50,083
She sustained neurological damage. We won't
know the extent till we get her to the hospital.

352
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:52,403
- Will she live?
- It's too early to say.

353
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,166
- Can I talk to her?
- That may not be a good idea.

354
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:57,926
- I asked the doctor a question.
- You can try.

355
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,891
But she's slipping
in and out of consciousness.

356
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:02,611
Lynne.

357
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:04,929
Lynne.

358
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,482
Lynne, it's me. David Palmer.

359
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:15,004
I'm so sorry.

360
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:24,487
We're getting you to the hospital,
but I need you to tell me how this happened.

361
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:30,808
Sir, she took a severe blow to the head.
She has a concussion and she's not coherent.

362
00:32:30,893 --> 00:32:34,124
- She's trying to say something.
- D... D... D...

363
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:37,444
It's OK. I'm here. I'm listening.

364
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:40,442
What is it, Lynne?

365
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:44,164
What is it?

366
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,772
It's all right, Lynne.

367
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:05,285
They're going to take good care of you.

368
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:10,529
- We need to get her to the hospital.
- Go.

369
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:27,890
Come on, Tony. Pick up the phone.

370
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:31,602
- I'm sorry. All services are busy.
- Damn it!

371
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,732
- Chappelle's going to find out.
- What are you talking about?

372
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:58,649
He said not to waste time looking for Jack,
but that's all you and Michelle are doing.

373
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:00,928
Why aren’t you working on the field intel?

374
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:04,562
Don't shine me on.
I'm trying to help you keep your job.

375
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:07,326
Really? By doing what?

376
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,130
- Not saying anything.
- OK.

377
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:13,408
Then don't say anything.

378
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:14,482
Um...

379
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:17,371
I want something in return.

380
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:23,332
- And what would that be?
- Michelle worked for me at District.

381
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:25,847
Things worked much better that way.

382
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:32,042
She's not qualified to be my boss. That's why
things have been so messed up here tonight.

383
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,442
So, uh...

384
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:38,128
you want Michelle's job.
Is that what this is about?

385
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:40,773
Yes.

386
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:43,845
And I assume you wanna keep yours.

387
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,930
Yeah.

388
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:51,689
Mr Chappelle, could you
come over here a second?

389
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,764
What do you need, Almeida?

390
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:57,323
Carrie's got something she wants to tell you.

391
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,087
What is it, Carrie?

392
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:11,726
Well?

393
00:35:13,453 --> 00:35:17,651
Carrie tried to extort a promotion out of me
by promising to keep her mouth shut.

394
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,928
That about right?

395
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:23,804
Mouth shut about what?

396
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:26,566
He and Michelle are still
trying to find Jack Bauer.

397
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:32,091
I was trying to give Tony the courtesy of a
warning. I was gonna tell you, Mr Chappelle...

398
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:35,529
That's enough, Carrie. Get back to work.

399
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,604
Yes, sir.

400
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:42,523
Thought I made myself clear, Tony.
We're past Bauer.

401
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,968
No, sir. You are. I'm not.

402
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:49,205
I'm director of CTU. I'm allocating resources
to ensure we have all the facts.

403
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:55,289
If you're not comfortable with me making
my own decisions, relieve me of my duties.

404
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:59,562
That won't be necessary.

405
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:02,365
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

406
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:06,241
I just don't have anyone
to take your place right now.

407
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:10,125
I don't like insubordination.

408
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:24,968
Come on.

409
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:28,363
You better hurry up.

410
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,648
It's there.

411
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,765
- What the hell is this?
- There's at least 20,000 euros.

412
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,969
- Euros?
- It's European money.

413
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:42,126
- I look European to you? Where's the cash?
- That is cash. It's as good as dollars.

414
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,807
We want cash money. You understand me?

415
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:46,770
Marcus?

416
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:56,168
- You think this is real?
- No, they keep the fake ones locked up

417
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,289
1500.

418
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:01,331
- That's it?
- That's it.

419
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:04,007
Now what do we do?

420
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:14,522
Look, just take it all.

421
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:17,252
Just gimme the chip.

422
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:19,929
She knows what we look like.

423
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:22,527
She knows our names too.

424
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,889
- We had a deal.
- He's right. We can't just leave you here.

425
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:30,364
Take everything! I won't tell anyone.
I won't tell the police, I promise.

426
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:32,887
Just give me the chip!

427
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,089
Don't do this. Let's take the stuff and go.

428
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:39,291
The second we walk out of here, she's
calling the cops. I can't get locked up again.

429
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:41,011
No!

430
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:59,322
- No!
- Gimme that!

431
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:08,212
- Kate, are you all right?
- Yeah. They've got the chip.

432
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:11,524
- How many rooms at the end of the hall?
- Two. Bedroom and bathroom.

433
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:12,966
Stay down.

434
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:31,281
All I want is the chip!

435
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:49,522
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent.

436
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:53,003
All I want is the chip, and then I'll let you go.

437
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,405
You shot my friend, man.
You expect me to believe you?

438
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:01,371
Right now you don't have a choice.

439
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:08,004
You come in here and I'm gonna smash
this thing. I'll put it right under my foot.

440
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:17,243
We're looking for Jack Bauer. He was on
a cellphone between Encino and Studio City.

441
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:23,329
We need to find him as soon as possible.
I need everyone to make this priority one.

442
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:38,203
Ladies and gentlemen, we can begin.

443
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,450
I'd like to thank you
for assembling at such short notice.

444
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:47,242
I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've asked you here,

445
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,962
why I've asked you to keep
the news of this meeting to yourselves.

446
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:54,568
Excuse me, Mr Vice President.
Shouldn't we wait for the president?

447
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:58,009
President Palmer will be joining us later.

448
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:00,561
I'm not sure I understand you.

449
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:03,804
The first part of this meeting
will be a closed session.

450
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:08,489
- Closed to the president?
- I'm afraid that's the point of the meeting.

451
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:16,291
To some of you this will come as a surprise.

452
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:20,885
For most of you, though,
I hope it comes as a relief.

453
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:26,491
But it is my sincere belief that,
based on his response to today's events,

454
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:32,170
David Palmer is unfit to continue
as president of the United States.

455

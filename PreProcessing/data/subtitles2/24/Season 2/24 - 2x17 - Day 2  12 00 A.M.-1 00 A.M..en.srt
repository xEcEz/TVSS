1
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:17,171
I know Tony's running things.
I don't want to speak out of turn.

2
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,562
- I don't know who else to talk to.
- About what?

3
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:24,044
The president's planning military action
based on a recording from Ali's apartment.

4
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,045
- Ali claims it was a fake.
- And you believe him.

5
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,169
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.

6
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:32,643
I regret to inform you,
Syed Ali has just been assassinated.

7
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,884
I think it has to do with the conversation
recorded in Cyprus.

8
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:39,204
- I don't believe it's genuine.
- OK, I'm aware of his denials.

9
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:42,171
I'm worried that someone
is trying to manipulate you

10
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:45,802
into taking the kind of military action
I assume you're about to take.

11
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:49,010
I told you I had money.
I didn't come here to steal.

12
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,653
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

13
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:56,084
Give me the gun.

14
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:58,926
- No.
- We've got the store surrounded.

15
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,892
- Oh, no. No.
- Put the gun down and come out.

16
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:04,808
This is Bauer.

17
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:08,568
The recording they found,
in case you haven't figured it out, is bogus.

18
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,213
- How do you know that?
- I'm the one who planted it.

19
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,602
- What do you want?
- Kate Warner.

20
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:18,164
You got 30 minutes. Bring her
to the warehouse, just the two of you.

21
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,689
- Where the hell you going?
- I don't have time to explain.

22
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:25,288
- Let's find the time.
- Put the gun down.

23
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,447
Kate, come on, we gotta go.
Now. Let's go.

24
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:32,403
Jack!

25
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,167
Come on.

26
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:49,563
Wait, Jack. Tell me what's going on.

27
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,564
Do you trust me?

28
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:58,044
- Kate, do you trust me?
- Yes.

29
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,967
I will explain everything to you in the car,
but we've gotta go now.

30
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:10,246
- Carrie!
- Tony!

31
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,166
- What happened?
- It was Jack.

32
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:16,370
I tried to stop him from taking
Kate Warner out of here.

33
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,444
- What is it?
- My ankle.

34
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:22,606
- I'll get the medic.
- Call Security. Make sure they stop Jack.

35
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:23,728
Yeah.

36
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:43,042
Security.

37
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,852
He's at the gate.

38
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:50,925
- Stop that vehicle!
- Hey! Stop!

39
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:56,643
- You OK?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:56,733 --> 00:03:01,170
I didn't mean to frighten you back there.
Let me try and explain everything to you.

41
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:05,610
The US is preparing to retaliate against
the Middle East for what happened tonight.

42
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:09,971
In a few hours, we'll be involved in a war
which'll affect every country on this planet.

43
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:12,089
What does that have to do with me?

44
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:14,403
Ten minutes ago a man called me.

45
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:18,850
Said he had proof the evidence the president
was basing his decisions on was forged.

46
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,812
He wouldn't give me any other information
unless I brought you to him.

47
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:25,202
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

48
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,683
That's the problem, Kate.
I don't know who he is.

49
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:31,845
- What would he want with me?
- We've gotta find out.

50
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:37,451
If I can provide concrete proof that the Cyprus
recording was fake, we can stop a war.

51
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,605
I will do what I can to protect you,
but you have to decide now.

52
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,527
You have to decide whether or not
you want to accept the risk.

53
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,926
Do you really think we can do this?

54
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:55,852
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is very, very dangerous.

55
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:02,403
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do.
I'm running out of time.

56
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,562
- Did they stop him?
- He drove through the gate.

57
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:14,292
- What's the problem?
- My ankle.

58
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,523
Let's take a look.

59
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:20,731
- Did you call LAPD?
- And the FBI. They're all looking for him.

60
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:23,930
Could be a torn ligament, maybe a sprain.
It's not broken.

61
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,163
- We've gotta get you an x-ray.
- Great.

62
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,244
I'll be right back with a first-aid kit.

63
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,211
- You said Jack took Kate with him?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,285
- I don't think he was working alone.
- What do you mean?

65
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:38,605
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate. Michelle
distracted him just before I found you.

66
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,685
- Distracted him how?
- She called him away on paperwork.

67
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,890
That doesn't mean
they were working together.

68
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:49,012
I think it does. Michelle was talking
to Jack right before she went to Baker.

69
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:52,768
- He might have been setting her up.
- It didn't appear that way.

70
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,131
The vice president's ready for your call, sir.

71
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:04,651
- When's he meet the British ambassador?
- Right after he speaks with you.

72
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,772
The vice president will want you
to authorise him

73
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:18,289
to inform the ambassador
of our deployment.

74
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:21,410
- He told you that?
- You know where Jim stands on this.

75
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:26,169
He'll want to let everyone know we're
on a war footing. Especially the British.

76
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,968
What's your position, sir?

77
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:35,285
Once we bring our allies in on this, it'll
make it much harder to recall those planes.

78
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:39,252
- Put him through.
- The president is ready to speak with him.

79
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,052
- Right away.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:46,046
Hello, Jim.

81
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,408
What's the British reaction
to the bombing?

82
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:51,565
Everyone is stunned.
Their military is on high alert.

83
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:55,566
- The British ambassador?
- He's waiting to hear from us.

84
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:59,566
After this conversation, I'm free
to inform him about the Stealth bombers?

85
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,451
Not just yet, Jim. It's still premature.

86
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:06,446
Those planes are due to drop their
payloads in a little over four hours.

87
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,524
We're holding off notifying our allies

88
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:12,003
because there's a possibility
we may not go through with the attack.

89
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,843
I don't understand.

90
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,766
I have reason to believe
the Cyprus audio implicating

91
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:20,162
the target countries was fabricated.

92
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:23,689
- I thought we proved it was real.
- As did I.

93
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:28,324
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining
intelligence that may show otherwise.

94
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:29,528
In the process?

95
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:33,322
- Meaning they don't have any proof yet.
- Correct.

96
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:37,406
Did you run it by CIA? Did they have
any indication this thing's a fraud?

97
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,290
Not as of yet.

98
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:44,970
Mr President, you authorised
this military action, and justifiably so.

99
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:48,728
With all due respect,
it's too late for second thoughts.

100
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,327
We will not start a war
on false or incomplete information.

101
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,328
- Say nothing to the ambassador.
- Yes, Mr President.

102
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:06,604
Mr President...
I know you trust Jack Bauer implicitly,

103
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:11,403
but to equivocate our response
in a matter of this importance

104
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:15,532
because of one man's reservations
makes me very uncomfortable.

105
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,642
I'm afraid I'm with Mike on this one, sir.

106
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,769
Noted.

107
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:36,327
This is Deputy Raynes. Mr Garcia,
we have officers surrounding the building.

108
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:39,132
Your only option
is to throw your weapon out

109
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,443
and come out with your hands on your head.

110
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,492
Stay with me. No. No!

111
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,650
I can't stop the bleeding.
We need to get him to a hospital.

112
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,805
- Please don't let him die.
- We need you to respond.

113
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:56,044
You need to talk to the police.
Tell them you'll give up.

114
00:07:56,133 --> 00:08:00,251
- We gotta let them in here right now.
- No, I didn't mean for this to happen.

115
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:05,965
A bomb went off. There's gonna be a war.
I was just trying to protect my wife.

116
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,772
- She's pregnant.
- I will tell the police that.

117
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:12,812
- We gotta get out of here!
- Mr Garcia, please respond.

118
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,488
Do you have someone in there
who needs medical attention?

119
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:18,609
- We can work this out.
- Stay with me.

120
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,447
But first you have to put
the weapon down and come out.

121
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,968
Let's walk out of here.

122
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:33,561
Come out, Mr Garcia. You're only
making things worse by prolonging it.

123
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:35,682
No!

124
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:38,241
We can work this out,
but you have to work with us.

125
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,608
Oh, please don't die.

126
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,287
- Please don't let him die.
- Please respond.

127
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:51,410
Why won't they help you, back at CTU?

128
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:55,805
Tony Almeida's in charge. He's under
pressure. He doesn't think it's a forgery,

129
00:08:55,893 --> 00:09:00,364
so he's following the proper protocol.
He's doing what he thinks is right.

130
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:06,442
- Where are we supposed to meet him?
- A small warehouse in Studio City.

131
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,251
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

132
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,042
- Who do you think it is?
- I don't know. Hold on.

133
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:41,082
Turn the ignition off! Put your hands
on the wheel! Put your hands on the wheel!

134
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:45,848
- You alone?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:49,687
- Why did you follow me from CTU?
- No one's given me any information.

136
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:54,449
I told you at CTU that my country is being
implicated. I don't know who I can trust.

137
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:59,561
I saw you take out Tony, who's in charge.
You don't want your country to invade mine.

138
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:04,124
My agenda is not to help your country. My
responsibility is to make sure the president

139
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:08,206
- makes his decisions based on fact.
- My country's not responsible.

140
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:13,083
Maybe, but Ali is a citizen of your country.
He runs his terrorist network from there.

141
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:17,291
Yes, which means he's a criminal
to my government just as much as yours.

142
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:22,049
Why would my country deliberately provoke
an attack that would decimate us?

143
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,966
We have everything to lose, nothing to gain.

144
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,211
What do you want?

145
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:36,252
When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
You'll need help.

146
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,411
- Tony.
- Yeah?

147
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,964
- What did the doctor say?
- I don't know, they think I tore a ligament.

148
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:51,683
Look... Carrie told me
that she saw you talking to Jack,

149
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:54,810
right before he took Kate Warner out of CTU.

150
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:59,808
- Yeah. Is that a problem?
- It depends what you were talking about.

151
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,849
What were you talking about?

152
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,488
Are you interrogating me?

153
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:13,729
Did you help Jack
take Kate Warner out of here?

154
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:16,327
Of course not.

155
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:19,371
Is that what Carrie told you?
I'm in collusion with Jack?

156
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:22,251
- Yeah.
- I don't know what to tell you.

157
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,166
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

158
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,642
Look, Michelle.

159
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:31,089
It doesn't matter whether
you think Jack is right or wrong.

160
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:35,803
The fact is, this is my command,
and what happens here is my responsibility.

161
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:39,852
- I know that.
- So I need you to be honest with me now.

162
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,768
Did you intentionally draw Agent Baker
away from Kate Warner?

163
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,970
No. I did not.

164
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:53,922
- So why would Carrie tell me you did?
- Because she'd like to see me out of here.

165
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:58,450
- And why's that?
- Because I don't like her, and she knows it.

166
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,682
- You wanna tell me about it?
- No, not really.

167
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:10,611
- If it's interfering with your work...
- It's not interfering with my work.

168
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:12,684
It's not.

169
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:16,086
OK. Thanks.

170
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:42,287
Mr Garcia, we are contacting you
by phone. Please answer.

171
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:47,401
What have I done?!
I'm going to prison for the rest of my life.

172
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,567
- You don't know that.
- I killed a man!

173
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,484
It was an accident. I saw it.

174
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:56,964
If you turn yourself in now, they'll consider
that. If you don't, it'll get worse.

175
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,442
I've got to get out of here.

176
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,726
Hey! Don't touch that phone.

177
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:14,651
- Yeah?
- Mr Garcia, this is Deputy Raynes.

178
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,691
Now, whatever the problem is,
we can work this out.

179
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,731
- Now, who's in there with you?
- A customer. A girl.

180
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:25,125
- OK, is she hurt?
- No. It's the owner.

181
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:27,249
OK, we have to get him out of there.

182
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,848
It's too late. Look, I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

183
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,444
Now, that's OK. Let's talk about it.

184
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,730
It's because of the bomb.
Look, there's gonna be a war.

185
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:41,692
I'm trying to get my wife out of the city.
You understand that, right?

186
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,731
Your wife is right here.
She's worried about you.

187
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:46,724
Put her on the phone.
I wanna talk to her.

188
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,683
Ramon, are you OK?
Why are you still in there?

189
00:13:55,693 --> 00:14:00,130
- Mija... I killed a man.
- No!

190
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:06,527
It was an accident, but they won't believe
me. You and the baby have to leave now.

191
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,411
It's not safe to be in the city.

192
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:14,330
Ramon, mijo, come out.

193
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:18,611
No, not yet. OK, look, I'm gonna tell the police
to take you where you'll be safe.

194
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:25,612
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

195
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:33,928
All right, Mr Garcia, you talked to your wife.
We'd like you to come out.

196
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,402
OK, but I want you
to do one thing for me first.

197
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,484
What's that?

198
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,883
Take her to Monterey.
She's got a sister there.

199
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:47,366
When she gets there, I'll let the girl go,
and then I'll come out.

200
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:17,604
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to stay here. I'm going in.

201
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:22,483
If you need to get in touch, there's a cellphone
in the centre console. Press one.

202
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,887
Kate, you OK?

203
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:30,171
Don't forget, I will do everything
I have to to protect you, OK?

204
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:34,922
- Yeah.
- Just stay put.

205
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,931
Drop the weapon. Put the weapon down!

206
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,124
All right.

207
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:44,809
My weapons are there on that table.
I'm unarmed.

208
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:49,728
Put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers. You know the drill.

209
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,848
If that's a Dunlop, it'll pick up a piece
of shrapnel that's still in my rib cage.

210
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,127
Yep, see?

211
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,724
Take a seat.

212
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,645
Who are you?

213
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:19,009
Jonathan Wallace, 7th Light
Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion,

214
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:23,245
Third Marine Division, Special Ops
Detachment Delta, Fort Benning.

215
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,761
Slowly... raise your right arm.

216
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,725
Show the inside of your forearm to me.

217
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:43,008
- Coral Snake Unit.
- That's right.

218
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,846
So you're the seventh man.

219
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:50,563
You took out your unit that was tracking
the bomb so they couldn't stop it. Why?

220
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,644
I was responsible for two things:

221
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:57,602
making sure the bomb went off, planting the
recording to blame it on the three countries.

222
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:01,572
- To what end?
- What else, Jack? To start a war.

223
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,725
The end game was always to get the US
to attack the Middle East.

224
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,132
Why?

225
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:10,968
They didn't tell me, but they didn't have to.
These men control oil in the Caspian Sea.

226
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:15,205
If there's a war, their holdings quadruple
in value for at least a decade.

227
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:18,444
At the cost of detonating a nuclear device
in the centre of LA?

228
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,252
You got it.

229
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,928
What do you want with Kate Warner?

230
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:28,562
About an hour ago, the people
who hired me tried to have me killed.

231
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:32,965
Obviously, they didn't succeed,
but they took out my transport team.

232
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,931
I need an alternate way out of the country.

233
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:40,803
Warner Industries has DOD variance.
She can authorise a departure.

234
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:46,331
So, evidence against the Cyprus recording
for your departure. That's the deal?

235
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:47,732
Yep.

236
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:16,362
Keep your mouth shut
and get out of the car.

237
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:19,965
Unlock the door. Do it now!

238
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,209
Come on, get out of the car!

239
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:34,004
You OK?

240
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:41,563
- So where's the Warner girl?
- When we're done.

241
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,725
How does the evidence prove
the recording was forged?

242
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:48,931
I have the source recordings. Before they
were mixed down to create the fake tape.

243
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,606
- Yeah.
- There was another guy. I took care of him.

244
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,127
Is he there?

245
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:02,011
It's for you.

246
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:08,922
Hello?

247
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:12,483
The man you sent to pick up Kate Warner
is unconscious. He's out.

248
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:13,847
You're lying.

249
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:17,687
He's six-two, dark hair,
pretty nasty scar on his face.

250
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:24,003
OK. It doesn't change anything.

251
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:27,768
I got what you need and I won't give it
to you until you give me Kate Warner.

252
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,492
I'll take you to her.
We'll arrange your charter.

253
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,643
No, no, no.

254
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,964
She can't authorise a charter
unless a partner is on board,

255
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:39,045
and right now your people
have Bob Warner in custody.

256
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,283
So she's coming with me.

257
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,729
What do you plan to do with her
when you reach your destination?

258
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,407
I have to dispose of her. You know that.

259
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,570
I can't let that happen.

260
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:54,123
We're done here.

261
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,406
Wait.

262
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:22,810
- Yusuf, do you copy?
- We're here. What do you want me to do?

263
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:24,884
Bring her in.

264
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,204
Lynne.

265
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:02,371
- Yeah, Mike?
- How do I get ahold of Jack Bauer?

266
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,522
Last I heard, he was debriefing at CTU. Why?

267
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:10,323
The president's hesitating with this operation,
based on a conversation he had with Bauer.

268
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,404
I wanna to talk to him myself.

269
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:15,087
Behind the president's back?

270
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,646
That is so dangerous.

271
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:24,853
If I can get some concrete information,
I can support the president more effectively.

272
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,446
And if you can't?

273
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:32,165
Then I'll have the conviction to talk him
through the situation. I'm in the dark.

274
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:36,371
- I'm not sure.
- Lynne... Lynne, this is my call.

275
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:41,288
Your recommendation not to go
around the president is duly noted.

276
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,404
Thanks.

277
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:06,491
Mr Almeida, Mike Novick, the
president's chief of staff, is on the line.

278
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:14,292
- Mr Novick, this is Tony Almeida.
- Hi, Tony. I need to reach Jack Bauer.

279
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:17,285
Yeah, well, we're trying
to locate him ourselves, sir.

280
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,203
What do you mean? What's the problem?

281
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:23,410
Jack was here earlier,
debriefing from the day's events,

282
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:27,532
when he grabbed a material witness
and took her off the premises illegally.

283
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:31,128
- He also assaulted CTU personnel.
- Why would he do that?

284
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:34,762
Jack's working on a hunch
that the Cyprus recording was fabricated.

285
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:37,492
This is what I wanted to talk to him about.

286
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:40,133
The president is not giving
his complete support

287
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:44,001
to the military action
until he hears from Bauer.

288
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:48,686
- I understand, sir.
- Now, what about the witness he's taken?

289
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:51,446
- How does that factor in?
- Her name is Kate Warner.

290
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:54,366
Her sister was involved
with the Second Wave terrorists.

291
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:58,492
We're trying to connect the dots.
That's the other reason we need to find Jack.

292
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:03,647
The second you make contact with Bauer,
you put him through to me. We're at District.

293
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,724
Yes, sir.

294
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:15,886
- Turner.
- Carrie.

295
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:18,692
- What's up?
- Yeah, I need to see you.

296
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,764
Yeah.

297
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,887
Yes, Tony?

298
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:43,568
- Where are we on Jack?
- His exit wasn't picked up on satellite.

299
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:48,488
- He hasn't initiated contact with anyone.
- What about Kate Warner?

300
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:52,851
Her house and her father's company
are being watched, in case they go there.

301
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,924
Good.

302
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,248
Have you talked to Michelle?

303
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:05,531
Yeah. In fact, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

304
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,882
Do you have a problem working
in the same office with Michelle?

305
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:12,726
Is that what you think?
That I'd be making up stories

306
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,203
because I have a problem
working with her?

307
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,365
She and Jack were talking
before he took Kate Warner.

308
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,762
They weren't trading recipes.

309
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,162
It was conspiratorial.

310
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,084
All right.

311
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:43,292
I need you to put a filter on all
of Michelle's communications.

312
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:47,048
E- mails, phone calls, open channels.

313
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:51,012
I want you to let me know
when Jack tries to contact her, all right?

314
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,084
Done.

315
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:19,885
- What's going on out there?
- They're taking my wife where she'll be safe.

316
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:21,964
And then what?

317
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:33,848
- You're gonna let me go, right?
- Don't push me. You got me into this.

318
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,972
- I didn't get you into this.
- You pointed this gun at me.

319
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:40,567
That's how this whole thing started.

320
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:45,890
What were you doing
with a gun anyway? Huh?

321
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,491
What?! Were you gonna rip this place off?

322
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,803
No.

323
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:54,851
You ruined my life. It's all your fault.

324
00:26:55,973 --> 00:27:00,649
- Sorry, I shouldn't have taken out that gun.
- Yeah? Well, why did you?

325
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:07,244
- I was afraid.
- Afraid. What do you have to be afraid of?

326
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,612
Answer me!

327
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:16,842
My daddy died tonight.
The bomb that went off, he was there.

328
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,282
What?

329
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:41,968
Your wife's on her way to Monterey.
Everything cool in there?

330
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:46,968
It's not cool. Make sure my wife gets there.
You don't need to call every five minutes.

331
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:51,331
OK, Ramon, you need to stay calm.
Now, we're doing exactly what you said.

332
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:54,371
You got to think this through.
You'll be in custody soon.

333
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:58,082
- I didn't mean to kill anybody!
- We know.

334
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:02,769
But what would help your case
is if you'd let the young lady out now.

335
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:06,766
I'm not stupid! She's the only reason
you haven't shot your way in here yet.

336
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:10,641
And I'll tell you something.
If I see you coming in, I'll kill her!

337
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,928
You better believe that!

338
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:17,962
You're not a killer, Ramon.
You've got no record. Be smart.

339
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:19,645
I'll be smart. You be smart.

340
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:21,965
Damn it!

341
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,322
Get back here!

342
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:32,202
No! No! Open the door! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

343
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,683
Help me! Hurry, I'm at the back door!
Help! Please!

344
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:38,642
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will!

345
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:42,451
Mr Garcia, what's going on in there?

346
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:46,329
Oh, my God.

347
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,688
- Mr Garcia, pick up the phone.
- No!

348
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:49,967
No!

349
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,447
Please respond, Mr Garcia.

350
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,451
Hey. Hey.

351
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,122
Is there anyone else besides you?

352
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:13,525
- Kate, look the other way.
- No, no. No one else. There's no one else.

353
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:19,206
- Come on.
- Wait, the warehouse is that way.

354
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:21,011
- Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead.

355
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,130
I'll approach in a sweep pattern.
It'll take a few minutes.

356
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:26,204
Copy that.

357
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:33,043
- They're gonna be five minutes.
- And here we are without a deck of cards.

358
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:39,731
You know, I was down at Benning
when Samuels tried to recruit you.

359
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,804
Yeah.

360
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:45,442
He was real disappointed
you turned him down.

361
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:50,086
He said you were a born killer.

362
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:54,604
Is that true?

363
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,572
- Turner.
- I got an alarm on the backup server.

364
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:59,407
- Do you have one?
- No. Must be on your side of the router.

365
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,370
Want me to check the connections?

366
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,650
No, you need C-clearance for that.
I'll have to do it.

367
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,164
Right, I forgot.

368
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,770
- Will you give this to Thomkins for me?
- Sure.

369
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:02,764
Thank you.

370
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:07,402
- Mr President, may I?
- What is it, Mike?

371
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:14,930
Jack Bauer took a material witness from CTU
and assaulted an agent in the process.

372
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:18,092
I know how much this country
owes him, sir,

373
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:21,483
but he's obviously suffered
some kind of emotional collapse.

374
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:25,566
It would be understandable,
given everything he's been through.

375
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,962
But we don't know that.

376
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:31,443
What he did might have been necessary
under the circumstances.

377
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,604
We already have incontrovertible
proof from Langley

378
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:38,253
that the Cyprus recording is authentic.

379
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,006
Finding Jack Bauer
isn't going to change that.

380
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:46,292
The country needs your energy and attention
on what happens after those bombs drop.

381
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:48,682
We need to prepare for this war.

382
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:55,971
If this recording's not authentic,
and Jack Bauer turns out to be right,

383
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,328
it'd be a mistake of historic proportions.

384
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:01,007
- Mr President...
- That's all, Mike.

385
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:05,209
Find Jack Bauer.

386
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:21,249
She'll be here any minute.
Where's the evidence?

387
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,324
OK, here's how it's gonna go down.

388
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:29,048
I take Kate with me. She sets up the plane.
It picks us up at an airport of my choosing.

389
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,523
When I'm on that plane,
I'll call and tell you where the evidence is.

390
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,252
What assurances do I have you'll even call?

391
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,531
None. It's one of those things
where you're just gonna have to trust me.

392
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,362
Well, I don't.

393
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:48,211
Jack, you're the last person in the world
I want tracking me down.

394
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:02,932
- Jack, what's going on?
- You and I are going on a little trip.

395
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,764
Jack?

396
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,524
You have to go with him.

397
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:15,446
- What about you?
- Jack's not coming.

398
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,361
You gave me your word.

399
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:27,523
I'm sorry it has to be done like this.

400
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:31,922
Let go of me.

401
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:36,529
Talk to her, Jack. Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to do this differently.

402
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:39,969
Kate, remember everything
I said to you in the car.

403
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:44,642
Do what he says, and I promise you,
you will not get hurt.

404
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:49,204
You're giving me up, aren’t you?

405
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:18,606
- CTU, Dessler.
- Hey. Hey, it's me.

406
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:23,244
- Danny, what are you doing up?
- I can't sleep. Are you sure it's safe here?

407
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,971
Yeah. As far as I know, it is.

408
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:29,331
As far as you know? What the hell
does that mean? "As far as I know"?

409
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:31,085
Danny, you know my situation.

410
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,641
You know what, your situation sucks.

411
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:37,646
You're talking about my life. The least
you could do is tell me what you know.

412
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,008
There's nothing to know.
Stay where you are.

413
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:43,290
- I'll come over tomorrow.
- Don’t you patronise me!

414
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:47,161
Don’t you patronise me, cos I want answers.
A nuclear bomb just went off.

415
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:50,290
I wanna know if it's safe to stay here in LA.

416
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:52,728
What about the kids?
Don’t you care about them?

417
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:55,646
Of course. If there was anything
to know, I'd tell you.

418
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:59,521
Is that right? You didn't tell me
about the bomb. Did it slip your mind?

419
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:03,162
I already explained it to you.
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.

420
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:07,531
You know what? Maybe I should
call Carrie. She'd tell me.

421
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:10,810
- I thought you weren't speaking.
- We're not. She's a bitch.

422
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,885
- Danny, I will take care...
- Forget it.

423
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:49,726
Don't shoot me!

424
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:53,772
Please! I'm sorry!

425
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,882
Throw the weapon out the front door,

426
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,726
and come out with your hands
behind your head.

427
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:02,646
No! I need more time!

428
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:08,086
My wife's gonna be safe, right?

429
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:13,932
Come on, Ramon, you gotta cooperate
now. You got nobody left in there.

430
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,173
Anybody have a visual on the suspect?

431
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:25,448
No. Should we hold position?

432
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:29,924
No. Ever since the bomb, we got a new call
every ten minutes. We gotta be done here.

433
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:32,891
Please don't. Give him time.
He'll come out on his own.

434
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,567
All right, all units go. Go now, go!

435
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,444
Drop your weapon!

436
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:40,761
No.

437
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:46,933
Code 4. Send medical...

438
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:49,049
Medical team, go!

439
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:59,084
- Thank you.
- All right.

440
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:02,563
- We ready?
- Yes, we are, Mike.

441
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:08,041
Mr Vice President,
you're on with me and Lynne

442
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:11,250
because the president
is being briefed by Ryan Chappelle.

443
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,369
He asked that we go ahead without him.

444
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,603
- Fine.
- How did it go with the British ambassador?

445
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:22,005
Not well. He knows that we're planning
a retaliation against the Middle East,

446
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,891
but he's frustrated cos
we're not coordinating with them.

447
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,567
I'm sure he'll understand
once he gets the facts.

448
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,962
What are the facts, Mike?

449
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:33,363
We've got planes in the air.
Either we're committed or we're not.

450
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:39,085
If the evidence shows
that the Cyprus recording was falsified,

451
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:43,132
the president wants the option
of calling those planes back.

452
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:47,092
You know what it sounds like to me?
An excuse to call this off.

453
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:58,131
Do you believe the president's capable
of doing the hard thing, Mike?

454
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:02,368
The right thing?

455
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,802
Yes, sir, I do.

456
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:13,445
He's committed to this action. All he's doing
is making sure every base is covered.

457
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,403
I hope so.

458
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:22,724
The president will be contacting you
as soon as anything develops.

459
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,122
All right, Mike.

460
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,921
Mike.

461
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:45,126
You think the vice president
is right, don’t you?

462
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,971
If the president turns those planes around,

463
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:54,410
based on the unconfirmed speculation
of a single CTU agent,

464
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,406
it'll be a disaster.

465
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:08,004
So what do we do about it?

466
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,204
I don't know.

467
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:26,053
- Where are you taking me?
- Get in.

468
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,887
I'm not gonna try and escape.

469
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:36,647
- I said, get in.
- Kate. Get in the trunk, for your own safety.

470
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,044
- The tracker's in place. It's been activated.
- Good.

471
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:25,805
Jack, it's been a real pleasure.

472
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,369
I'll be in touch.

473
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,686
